"Out Seeing is Believing A Traditional Story The Day Creativity Met the Linear Dragon The Wall and the Bridge The Wish Several One Way Conversations How the King Learned about Love The Fly and the Elephant The Man Who Talked Backwards The Clue An Analogy The Second Greatest Commandment A man was out shoveling the excess gravel off his driveway and into the graveled road that ran by his house. A neighbor happened to be walking by just as the man tossed a shovel full down the road the opposite way the man used to drive in and out. ""I see you aren't messing up the part of the road you use,"" sneered the neighbor. A few minutes later another neighbor happened by and saw the man toss a shovel full of gravel down the other part of the road. ""I see you are fixing only the part of the road you use, and not the part others must use,"" sneered the second neighbor. The shoveler stood still with a shovel full of gravel as the second man left. Now unsure of what to do with it that would be agreeable to his neighbors, he decided simply to dump it out onto his driveway on the very spot whence he had scooped it up. Just as he did so, a third neighbor happened to be walking by. ""I see you are stealing gravel from the road for your driveway,"" sneered the third man. ""People like you are what's wrong with this country."" At this point the homeowner put his shovel away and sat down with his pipe to contemplate these occurrences. Pretty soon a neighbor from further down the street drove by and saw the man sitting down enjoying his pipe. ""If you weren't so lazy, you'd shovel some of that gravel off your driveway and back onto the road where it belongs,"" the driver sneered as he drove away, spinning his tires and scattering gravel in every direction. A Good Horse and a Better A man once came upon a lad about midday skipping stones across a pond. ""Hello, young man,"" he said, approaching. ""What brings you here on a school day?"" ""I wrote a poem yesterday which was the best in class, and the teacher said I could play today while the other children wrote more poems."" ""Well, then, you are to be congratulated. Yours is certainly a deed of distinction. And as a reward,"" he added, settling himself on a tree stump, ""let me tell you a story about two horses."" ""Oh, yes, do,"" the youth said eagerly, sitting down at the man's feet. ""The first horse lived in Arabia, and he was beautiful and strong. He had never lost a race. And he was shrewd. He would run just hard enough to pull away from the other horses in the race, and then he would let up and trot, or even walk, across the finish line, to the great embarrassment and humiliation of all the other horses."" ""He was clearly a superior animal,"" the young poet interjected. ""Yes, he was,"" agreed the man. ""Now the other horse lived in Macedonia, and he, too, was strong and noble. He had, however, lost one race, the first race of his life; and some say he always remembered that when he ran."" ""How grating to the heart it must be to lose so early and have a blight on one's reputation,"" mused the young man. ""But this horse always won every other race. And unlike our first horse, when this Macedonian horse ran and knew he had beaten the other horses, instead of letting up he redoubled his efforts and ran even harder--as hard as he could--for he now ran not against the fortuitous competitors with whom he began the race, but against his own heart: against all horses past and all horses future, against every horse in Macedonia and every one in Arabia, and also against the ideal horse with a pace so frighteningly fast that few can conceive its possibility. And even more than this, he ran toward the perfection of excellence itself. And when he crossed the finish line, as happy as he was to win, he secretly lamented that his opponents had not been fast enough to threaten him and push him onward."" ""Even though he lost once,"" the lad remarked after a short silence, ""perhaps this horse was as good as the Arabian."" ""Perhaps so, my child,"" said the man, with a smile. ""Perhaps so."" It's Nut Valuable Once upon a time a wise and thoughtful craftsman made a new electric adding machine. It was very complex with many gears and levers and wheels, and it did amazing things, always adding up the numbers correctly. So the craftsman sold it to a businessman for many thousands of dollars. All the parts inside the new adding machine felt good about being so valuable. They worked hard and happily all day, and often talked about how useful they were to the businessman. But one day a spring noticed a little nut just sitting on the end of a shaft. The spring pulled at the lever he was attached to and pointed. Soon the whole works knew. ""You lazy little nut,"" said a spinning gear, ""why don't you get to work?"" ""But I am working,"" said the nut. ""Holding on is my job."" ""That's stupid,"" yelled a cam. ""I don't believe our maker put you here. You just sneaked in to steal some of our glory. Why don't you get out?"" ""Well,"" said the nut, ""I'm sure our maker knew what he was doing, and that I do serve a purpose. I hold on as tightly as I can."" But all the machinery began to squeal and abuse the nut so violently that he felt very sad and began to doubt himself. ""Maybe I am useless,"" he thought. He appealed to the shaft he was threaded onto. ""Look, kid,"" the shaft told him, ""I've got plenty of",0,0.0
"Day 1:
As I stepped off the plane at San Francisco International Airport, I couldn't help but feel a surge of excitement. I had always dreamt of visiting the vibrant city of San Francisco, and now I was finally here, ready to embark on a three-day adventure. The first thing on my agenda was to find transportation to the city, and luckily, there were plenty of options available.

San Francisco is known for its diverse culinary scene, and I was eager to try some of the local delights. I stumbled upon a little seafood shack near the wharf and indulged in a delicious bowl of clam chowder served in a fresh sourdough bread bowl. The flavors were incredible, and it was the perfect way to kick off my gastronomic journey through the city.

With my hunger satisfied, I spent the rest of the day exploring some of San Francisco's iconic landmarks. I strolled along the waterfront, admiring the famous sea lions at Pier 39 and the picturesque view of the Golden Gate Bridge in the distance. As the sun started to set, I hopped on a cable car, eager to experience this classic mode of transportation that San Francisco is so famous for. The ride was exhilarating as we climbed up the steep hills, providing breathtaking views of the city.

Day 2:
On my second day in San Francisco, I decided to venture beyond the city limits and explore the surrounding areas. I had heard about the scenic beauty of Marin County, just north of the city, and I couldn't resist the opportunity to experience it for myself. I rented a bike and crossed the iconic Golden Gate Bridge, feeling a sense of accomplishment as I pedaled across the majestic structure.

Once on the other side, I found myself in the charming town of Sausalito. The waterfront town was bustling with life, boasting quaint shops, art galleries, and waterfront restaurants. I treated myself to a leisurely lunch with a mesmerizing view of the San Francisco skyline across the bay.

After lunch, I hopped on the ferry back to the city, enjoying the panoramic views of the Golden Gate Bridge from the water. Back in San Francisco, I decided to explore the vibrant neighborhoods of Chinatown and North Beach. The narrow streets of Chinatown were bustling with activity, and I couldn't resist picking up some souvenirs and trying some delicious dim sum.

The neighboring North Beach, known as San Francisco's Little Italy, was a delightful mix of Italian eateries, quaint bookstores, and lively cafes. I treated myself to a cannoli from a local bakery and enjoyed the vibrant atmosphere as I wandered through the streets.

Day 3:
On my final day in San Francisco, I wanted to make sure I didn't miss out on any of the city's must-see attractions. I started my morning with a visit to Alcatraz Island, the infamous former prison located in the middle of the bay. The audio tour provided a fascinating insight into the history of the island, and I couldn't help but feel a chill running down my spine as I walked through the eerie cellblocks.

In the afternoon, I headed to Golden Gate Park, a sprawling oasis filled with lush greenery, meandering paths, and picturesque gardens. I spent hours exploring the Japanese Tea Garden, the Conservatory of Flowers, and the de Young Museum, taking in the beauty and tranquility of the park.

As the day drew to a close, I made sure to catch the sunset at Lands End, a stunning lookout point on the western edge of the city. The panoramic views of the Pacific Ocean, the Golden Gate Bridge, and the rugged coastline were awe-inspiring. It was the perfect way to bid farewell to the vibrant city that had captured my heart.

Reflecting on my three-day tour of San Francisco and its surrounding areas, I couldn't help but feel grateful for the incredible experiences I had. From the iconic landmarks to the diverse neighborhoods, from the delicious food to the breathtaking scenery, San Francisco had exceeded all my expectations. The warmth and friendliness of the people I met along the way only added to the charm of this incredible city.

As I boarded my plane back home, I couldn't help but feel a pang of nostalgia. San Francisco had left an indelible mark on my heart, and I knew that I would carry the memories of this extraordinary trip with me for a lifetime.",1,0.0
"The Impending Catastrophe: A Multidisciplinary Analysis of the Earth's Future

As I delve into the vast expanse of research, spanning across various disciplines, it becomes excruciatingly clear that our planet is teetering on the brink of catastrophe. Climate change, driven by human actions, looms large over every aspect of life on Earth. This multidisciplinary analysis aims to shed light on the potential consequences of our actions, highlighting the interconnectedness of different fields of study, and emphasizing the urgent need to address these issues before it's too late.

From an environmental perspective, climate change threatens our delicate ecosystems, pushing them to the brink of collapse. Rising global temperatures lead to the melting of polar ice caps, causing sea levels to rise and endangering coastal cities and communities. The resulting loss of biodiversity disrupts vital ecological processes, leading to imbalances that can have far-reaching consequences. Coral reefs, for example, are not only breathtakingly beautiful, but they also serve as nurseries and habitats for a myriad of marine species. With the increase in ocean acidification and warmer waters, these fragile ecosystems are under immense stress, risking their ability to survive.

The consequences of climate change extend far beyond the environment. Economic systems are intricately linked with the health of our planet, and disruption in one area can have cascading effects on others. Extreme weather events, more frequent and intense due to climate change, have profound implications on agriculture and food security. Changes in rainfall patterns and the spread of pests and diseases can decimate crops, leading to food shortages and higher prices. This not only affects the livelihoods of farmers but also impacts the global economy and exacerbates social inequalities, particularly in developing countries already facing food insecurity.

The health sector is also bracing for the impact of climate change. Rising temperatures facilitate the spread of infectious diseases, such as malaria and dengue fever, as disease-carrying vectors expand their range. Heatwaves, intensified by climate change, pose a direct threat to human health, especially among vulnerable populations such as the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions. Moreover, the degradation of air quality due to increased pollution exacerbates respiratory illnesses and poses a significant risk to public health.

Social and political systems are not immune to the effects of climate change either. Displacement of communities due to rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and dwindling resources can lead to conflicts and mass migrations. This, in turn, puts pressure on governments to address societal challenges such as overcrowding, resource allocation, and socioeconomic disparities. The social fabric of our societies can be strained to its limits, potentially leading to increased tensions and unrest.

Understanding the interconnectedness of these different fields of study is crucial to comprehending the magnitude of the impending catastrophe. Climate change is not a standalone issue; it is a threat that permeates every facet of our existence. We cannot address the environmental crisis without considering its economic, health, and social implications. A multidisciplinary approach is vital to developing sustainable solutions, as it allows us to draw from a wide range of expertise and encourage collaboration between scientists, policymakers, and communities.

Though the situation may seem dire, there is still hope. By acknowledging the urgency of the situation and taking immediate action, we can mitigate the worst consequences of climate change. Transitioning to clean and renewable energy sources, promoting sustainable agriculture, and investing in resilient infrastructure are just a few steps that can make a significant difference. Education and awareness play a pivotal role in empowering individuals and communities to take action and hold governments and corporations accountable for their impact on the planet.

We cannot afford to be complacent in the face of this impending catastrophe. The time for action is now. Let us harness the power of multidisciplinary research, bridge the gaps between fields, and work together to secure a sustainable future for generations to come. The fate of our planet rests in our hands.",1,0.0
"Nel pittoresco quartiere di San Telmo a Buenos Aires, sorgeva un'osteria speciale chiamata ""Osteria degli Scampoli"". Al di fuori, un piccolo cartello di legno dipinto a mano annunciava il nome del locale, mentre una fila di sedie a sdraio invitava i passanti a sedersi e godersi il sole argentino. Ma cosa rendeva questa osteria così speciale? Era gestita da un gruppo di uomini disabili che avevano deciso di intraprendere un'avventura imprenditoriale insieme.

In the heart of Buenos Aires, a city known for its hustle and bustle, these men had found solace and purpose in their inn. Each of them had experienced life-altering accidents that had left them with different disabilities, but they had refused to let their circumstances define them. Instead, they had embraced their newfound community and their shared dreams.

The inn was the brainchild of a former sailor named Roberto, who had lost both his arms in a tragic accident at sea. Despite his disability, Roberto had a zest for life that was infectious. His face was etched with lines of laughter and his deep-set eyes twinkled with mischievousness. He was the heart and soul of the Osteria degli Scampoli, and his enthusiasm drew people from all walks of life to the inn.

Roberto's wife, Maria, was the backbone of the operation. She had dedicated her life to taking care of her husband, learning to do everything from tying his shoelaces to helping him navigate the challenges of everyday life. Maria had a quiet strength about her and a love for Roberto that was evident in every gesture, every touch. Together, they formed a dynamic duo, overcoming obstacles with a resilience that was both awe-inspiring and humbling.

The inn itself was a charming and vibrant place. The walls were adorned with photographs and paintings, each telling a story of the men's lives before their accidents. A small stage in the corner hosted regular performances, where the disabled men showcased their talents for music, dance, and storytelling. The guests would gather around, clapping and cheering, as the room filled with laughter and applause.

The menu of the Osteria degli Scampoli was as diverse as its owners. Each dish was lovingly crafted, using traditional Argentine ingredients with a twist. The aromas of fragrant spices mingled with the sounds of sizzling pans, creating a symphony of flavors that delighted the senses. The inn had become a hub for food lovers and adventure seekers alike, a place where people could indulge in their passions and leave their worries behind.

But the Osteria degli Scampoli was more than just a restaurant. It was a sanctuary, where the disabled men could break free from the societal expectations that often held them back. In this haven, they were not defined by their disabilities; they were defined by their dreams and their determination to make them come true.

One of the men, Miguel, had been a professional soccer player before a car accident had left him paralyzed from the waist down. At the inn, he found solace in coaching local children, sharing his love for the sport and inspiring others to pursue their dreams. His infectious laughter and unwavering optimism brought joy to all who crossed his path.

And then there was Carlos, a former architect who had lost his sight in a construction accident. Despite his disability, Carlos had not let go of his passion for design. He had developed a keen sense of touch, allowing him to create intricate sculptures out of clay. His work adorned the walls of the inn, a testament to the power of creativity and resilience.

As the days turned into weeks and the weeks into months, the Osteria degli Scampoli became a beacon of hope in the bustling streets of Buenos Aires. Tourists and locals alike flocked to the inn, not only for its delicious food but also to witness the incredible spirit of its owners. It was a place of laughter, of dreams, and of endless possibilities.

Roberto and Maria had created a haven where disability was not a barrier, but rather a catalyst for creativity and strength. Their love for each other and for life itself was a testament to the indomitable human spirit. Each day, as the sun set over the osteria, the laughter and joy echoed through the streets, reminding everyone that in the face of adversity, anything is possible.

So, if you ever find yourself wandering the streets of Buenos Aires, make sure to stop by the Osteria degli Scampoli. Sit at one of the outdoor tables, soak in the atmosphere, and listen to the stories of these remarkable men.

"Resting spores, also known as resting stages or resting cysts, play a crucial role in the survival and dispersion of certain species of diatoms and fungi during adverse environmental conditions. These structures are formed as a response to various stressors such as nutrient deprivation, extreme temperatures, desiccation, or toxic substances in their habitats. Resting spores represent a state of dormancy, allowing these organisms to endure unfavorable conditions until more suitable ones arise.

In diatoms, which are unicellular photosynthetic algae, resting spores known as auxospores are formed during sexual reproduction. Auxospore formation is triggered when a diatom's size has become limited due to the asexual division of smaller cells over multiple generations. The auxospore is a specialized cell that, upon germination, undergoes a series of intricate processes known as auxosporulation. These processes enable the diatom to return to its original size and shape, ultimately restoring its potential for rapid growth and reproduction.

Auxospore formation in diatoms is vital for population persistence and competitive advantage. During nutrient depletion or unfavorable environmental conditions, the availability of resources becomes limited, impeding the normal asexual cell division. By producing resting spores, diatoms can bypass this limitation, ensuring genetic diversity and adaptation to changing habitats. Moreover, the larger size of auxospores makes them better suited to compete for light and nutrients, thereby enhancing their fitness in the ecosystem.

In fungi, resting spores are known by several names, including chlamydospores, sporangiospores, and sclerotia, depending on the species and structures formed. These spores are formed by a variety of mechanisms, such as the aggregation of hyphae, fusion of specialized cells, or encapsulation of reproductive structures. Resting spores in fungi serve as a protective measure against adverse conditions and allow for long-term survival.

Resting spores in fungi have significant implications for population dynamics and species dispersal. The ability to form specialized structures that can withstand inhospitable environments ensures the survival of fungal species in harsh conditions. Moreover, these spores can germinate and give rise to a new population when favorable conditions are restored, aiding in the rapid recolonization of locations that were previously uninhabitable.

The impact of resting spores on population seeding and competitive advantage in diatoms and fungi is noteworthy. These spores enable rapid population recovery once suitable conditions return, providing a competitive edge over other organisms that lack such adaptations. Their ability to withstand harsh environments allows them to maintain a presence even when other species struggle or perish. Consequently, diatoms and fungi possessing resting spore capabilities may dominate ecological communities during and after times of environmental stress.

Furthermore, resting spores contribute to genetic diversity within populations. As resting spores germinate, they give rise to new individuals with various genetic combinations. This genetic variation increases the likelihood of survival and adaptation to changing environmental conditions. It also enhances the potential for evolutionary processes, such as natural selection and genetic drift, to act upon the population, leading to the emergence of new traits and ensuring species resilience in the face of changing environments.

In conclusion, resting spores in diatoms and fungi play a vital role in their survival during adverse environmental conditions. These structures allow these organisms to endure stressors that would otherwise inhibit their growth and reproduction. Resting spores facilitate population persistence, genetic diversity, and competitive advantage, enabling diatoms and fungi to exploit ecological niches more effectively. Understanding the formation and significance of resting spores provides valuable insights into the adaptation and resilience of these organisms in the face of changing environments.",1,0.0
"248th (Welwyn) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Battery, Royal Artillery, (248 HAA Bty) was an air defence unit of Britain's Territorial Army (TA). Formed just before the Second World War, it fought in the Battle of France and the Swansea Blitz, and later defended London and Cyprus. It continued serving in the post-war TA until 1955. During the period of international tension in 1938, the TA was rapidly expanded, particularly for the Anti-Aircraft (AA) role. Much of this expansion was achieved by converting and/or expanding existing units. 343 (Watford) Field Battery was separated from 86th (East Anglian) (Herts Yeomanry) Field Brigade, Royal Artillery (partly descended from the old Hertfordshire Yeomanry cavalry) and converted into a complete new AA regiment, 79th (Hertfordshire Yeomanry) AA Regiment, Royal Artillery. Regimental headquarters (RHQ) and two of the batteries (246 (1st Watford) and 247 (2nd Watford)) remained at Watford, while the third (248) was newly raised at Welwyn Garden City.[1][3][4]>[5][2][6][7] The Hertfordshire Territorial Association obtained a site from the Welwyn Garden City Estate Office at Lemsford Lane where a drill hall could be built and recruitment for the new battery began on 14 November 1938. Supported by the local newspaper, public meetings and letters to local employers, recruitment went well and by March 1939 was close to the establishment of 172. Captain F.D.E. Fremantle of the 86th Field Regiment was appointed officer commanding (OC) of 248 Bty with the rank of Major. Training had to be carried out on two QF 3.7-inch AA guns borrowed from a London AA battery.[2][6][8][9] In June 1939, as the international situation worsened, a partial mobilisation of Anti-Aircraft Command was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each TA AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected gun positions.[10][11] 79th (HY) AA Regiment was embodied on 25 June for a partial deployment to gunsites along the south bank of the Thames Estuary, with 248 Bty at Brookley Park, Lewisham. The availability of equipment at the gunsites was invaluable for training the recruits, and the second half of the month's embodiment was spent at the AA Practice Camp at Bude in Cornwall, where 248 Battery scored a direct hit on a Queen Bee radio-controlled target aircraft.[12] On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war, AA Command was fully mobilised and sent to its war stations, which in the case of 79th (HY) AA Rgt were to defend airfields of 11 Group of RAF Fighter Command. One section of 248 Bty manned two 3-inch guns at RAF Biggin Hill while the rest of the battery manned Lewis Light machine guns (LMGs) at RAF Felixstowe (8 LMGs) and RAF Martlesham Heath (12 LMGs).[11][13][14] After war was declared on 3 September there were numerous adjustments to AA Command's deployment as further units and equipment became available. During the autumn 79th (HY) AA Rgt handed over most of its responsibilities for airfields, and shifted towards the Gun Defence Area (GDA) round the port of Harwich and adjacent harbours. 248 Battery was deployed as follows:[15] On 17 October the battery fired the regiment's first rounds in anger, when sites H2 and H3 engaged an aircraft identified as hostile. The War Establishment of the battery was now 290 all ranks, and on 21 October a draft of 132 recruits (Militiamen with 3 months' AA training) arrived, after which the 125 men who were aged under 19 or over 38, or who were unfit for overseas service, were posted away in early November.[8][15] On 26 December a warning order was received to prepare to move overseas, and the detachments concentrated at Harwich. The regiment was designated as a base defence AA regiment to man static 3.7-inch guns. 248 Battery was already experienced with the 3.7-inch and only needed to attend short courses by sections on a static gun site at Dartford, Kent before mobilising at Blackdown Camp near Aldershot. Here it was issued with vehicles (many of them impressed civilian lorries) and joined by a draft of 62 Militia reinforcements from Yorkshire to bring it up to full establishment.[15] 248 Battery proceeded from Blackdown to Southampton and sailed for France on the night of 7/8 February 1940. It landed at Le Havre where it came under the operational command of 8th (Belfast) AA Rgt in 3 AA Bde guarding the lines of communication for the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). It was to remain at Le Havre to man two static 3.7-inch gun positions at Parc de la Hève on the edge of the cliff in front of the lighthouse. The concrete pits were built and guns emplaced by 27 February and a Gun-Laying (GL) Radar Mk I was set up. While this was being done, Nos 2 and 3 Sections manned the guns at Octeville Airfield. The rest of the regiment disembarked on 6 March and deployed around the port and airfield. 79th (HY) AA Regiment devised an AA barrage scheme using fixed bearings and staggered heights over the docks and oil storage tanks for 'unseen' fire at night; this was codenamed 'Pillar of Fire'.[7][16][17][18][19][20][21][22] The Battle of France began on 10 May with the German invasion of the Low Countries and France. The BEF followed the pre-arranged Plan D and advanced into Belgium, but a rapid German breakthrough in the Ardennes forced it to fall back again. By 21 May the main body of the BEF was cut off, and between 26 May and 4 June as much as possible was evacuated through Dunkirk (Operation Dynamo).[23][24][25] From 10 to 19 May the only Luftwaffe activity in the Le Havre area had been daily reconnaissance flights, but on the night of 19/20 May there was a three-hour raid on the French airfield at Octeville, during which 'Pillar of fire' brought down an enemy aircraft, followed on succeeding nights by attempts to drop Parachute mines into the harbour entrance. Even after the Dunkirk evacuation ended, there were still British forces in France north of the Seine, and 79th (HY) HAA Rgt maintained its defences at",0,0.0
"I couldn't believe my luck when I returned from my space mission and heard about the discovery of an extinct intelligent species right here on Earth! It was like a dream come true for someone like me, who had spent years searching for signs of intelligent life beyond our planet. I made my way to the excavation site, brimming with excitement and curiosity, eager to learn all about this incredible find.

As I approached the site, I saw the Archeologist standing there, a mischievous smile on his face. He greeted me with a teasing tone, ""Well, well, look who decided to come down from the stars to join us lowly earthlings!"" I couldn't help but chuckle at his playful demeanor. He knew how much I craved the discovery of intelligent life, and I could tell that he had a secret he was itching to reveal.

""What have you found?"" I asked, unable to contain my anticipation any longer. The Archeologist flashed me a sly grin and motioned for me to follow him. We walked through the intricate maze of the excavation site, past the painstakingly unearthed artifacts and skeletal remains.

Finally, we arrived at a small, unassuming table where several objects had been carefully laid out. As I looked closer, my excitement soared to new heights. There, in front of me, were tools! Tools created by an intelligent species that had once roamed this planet!

The Archeologist began to explain the significance of the discovery. These tools were far more advanced than anything one would expect from the time period they were believed to belong to. It suggested that the extinct species possessed a level of intelligence that rivaled or even surpassed our own. I could hardly contain my awe!

My mind raced with questions. Who were these beings? How did they live? What led to their extinction? I yearned to learn their story, to unravel the mysteries of their existence. It was as if a whole new chapter of Earth's history had been opened, and I felt privileged to be a part of it.

But amidst the thrill of this amazing discovery, a twinge of disappointment washed over me. For all my years exploring the vastness of space, searching for signs of intelligent life, I had come up empty-handed. I had yearned for the connection, the ability to share knowledge and experiences with beings from another world. And yet, here on my own planet, I had stumbled upon the remnants of a lost intelligent species.

As I absorbed the magnitude of this discovery, a new desire was kindled within me. I longed to honor the memory of these beings, to understand their accomplishments and struggles. I wanted to bring their story to the world, to ensure that their intelligence and existence were acknowledged.

The Archeologist and I spent countless hours studying the artifacts, piecing together the puzzle of this extinct intelligent species. We worked tirelessly, driven by a shared passion for unraveling the mysteries of the past. Our conversations were filled with excitement and speculation, as we imagined what life must have been like for those who came before us.

As news of the discovery spread, the world was captivated by the story of this long-lost civilization. People were mesmerized by the intelligence and ingenuity of these beings, who had roamed the same lands that we now called home. It was a humbling reminder that we are not alone in our pursuit of knowledge and understanding.

For me, the discovery of this extinct intelligent species brought a sense of fulfillment that I had been searching for all my life.

A las mozas banseles tras l los ojos, segn entraban en misa, recatadas bajo la mantilla, y los chiquillos revoloteaban como moscas a su alrededor. Haba trado hasta una pipa con el rey a caballo, que pareca de verdad, y encenda los fsforos en la trasera de los pantalones, levantando la pierna como si diese un puntapi. Mas, con todo, Lola la del seor Angel no se dejaba ver ni en misa ni en el balcn: que se haba tomado los dichos con uno de Licodia que era carretero, y tena en la cuadra cuatro machos del Sortino. Cuando Turiddu lo supo, en el primer pronto, santo diablo!, quera sacarle las tripas al de Licodia; pero no lo hizo, y se desahog yendo a cantar bajo la ventana de la bella cuantas canciones de desdenes saba. -- Es que no tiene nada que hacer Turiddu, el de la ""sea"" Anuncia -- decan los vecinos --, que se pasa las noches cantando como un gorrin solitario? Al cabo, top con Lola, que volva del viaje a la Virgen de los Peligros, y que al verle ni palideci ni se puso colorada, cual si nada hubiera pasado. -- Ojos que te ven!-- le dijo. -- Hola, compadre Turiddu; ya me haban dicho que habas vuelto a primeros de mes. -- A m me han dicho otras cosas! -- respondi --. Es verdad que te casas con el compadre Alfio el carretero? -- Si es la voluntad de Dios...! -- contest Lola, juntando sobre la barbilla las dos puntas del pauelo. -- La voluntad de Dios la haces con el tira y afloja que te conviene! Y la voluntad de Dios ha sido que yo tena que venir de tan lejos para encontrarme con tan buenas noticias, Lola! El pobrecillo intentaba an drselas de valiente; pero la voz casi le faltaba e iba tras de la moza contonendose, bailndole de hombro a hombro la borla del gorro. A ella, en conciencia, le dola verle con una cara tan larga; pero no tena nimos para lisonjearle con buenas palabras. -- Oye, compadre Turiddu -- le dijo, al fin --, djame alcanzar a mis compaeras. Qu diran en el pueblo si me vieran contigo!... -- Es verdad -- respondi Turiddu --. Ahora que te casas con el compadre Alfio, que tiene cuatro machos en la cuadra, no hay que dar que hablar a la gente. Mi madre, la pobre, ha tenido que vender nuestra mula baya y el majuelillo de la carretera mientras yo era soldado. Pas el tiempo en que Berta hilaba, y t ya no te acuerdas de cuando hablbamos por la ventana del corral ni de cuando me regalaste el pauelo aqul, antes de marcharme, que Dios sabe las lgrimas que llor en l, al irme tan lejos, tan lejos, que se perda hasta el nombre de nuestro pueblo. Ahora, adis, Lola; hagamos cuenta que no hay ms que decir, y que si te he visto, no me acuerdo. La Lola se cas con el carretero, y los domingos se pona en el corredor, con las manos en el vientre, para ensear todos los anillos de oro que le haba regalado su marido. Turiddu segua paseando una y otra vez por la calleja, con su pipa en la boca y las manos en los bolsillos, con aire indiferente y guindole a las mozas; pero roale por dentro el que el marido de Lola tuviese todo aquel oro y el que ella fingiese no verle cuando pasaba. -- Se la voy a hacer en sus mismos ojos a esa perra! -- murmuraba. Frente por frente al compadre Alfio viva el seor Cols, el viador, rico como un cerdo segn decan, el cual tena una hija. Turiddu tanto dijo y tanto hizo, que intim con el seor Cols, y comenz a andar por la casa y a decirle palabritas dulces a la muchacha. -- Por qu no le dices todas esas cosas tan bonitas a la Lola? -- contestaba Santa. -- La Lola es una seorona! La Lola se ha casado con un rey! -- Yo no merezco reyes... -- T vales por cien Lolas, y conozco yo a uno que no mirara a la Lola ni al santo de su nombre cuando ests t, porque la Lola no sirve ni para descalzarte. Qu va a servir! -- La zorra que no poda alcanzar las uvas... -- Dijo:",0,0.0
"in English and American periodicals. Had my husband lived longer, he might have seen fit to revise this work, which is mainly from the earlier years of his strenuous life. But, as fate has entrusted to me the issuing of it, I consider it fitting and proper to let it go forth practically as it was left by him. FLORENCE BRAM STOKER Dracula's Guest When we started for our drive the sun was shining brightly on Munich, and the air was full of the joyousness of early summer. Just as we were about to depart, Herr Delbrck (the matre d'htel of the Quatre Saisons, where I was staying) came down, bareheaded, to the carriage and, after wishing me a pleasant drive, said to the coachman, still holding his hand on the handle of the carriage door: 'Remember you are back by nightfall. The sky looks bright but there is a shiver in the north wind that says there may be a sudden storm. But I am sure you will not be late.' Here he smiled, and added, 'for you know what night it is.' Johann answered with an emphatic, 'Ja, mein Herr,' and, touching his hat, drove off quickly. When we had cleared the town, I said, after signalling to him to stop: 'Tell me, Johann, what is tonight?' He crossed himself, as he answered laconically: 'Walpurgis nacht.' Then he took out his watch, a great, old-fashioned German silver thing as big as a turnip, and looked at it, with his eyebrows gathered together and a little impatient shrug of his shoulders. I realised that this was his way of respectfully protesting against the unnecessary delay, and sank back in the carriage, merely motioning him to proceed. He started off rapidly, as if to make up for lost time. Every now and then the horses seemed to throw up their heads and sniffed the air suspiciously. On such occasions I often looked round in alarm. The road was pretty bleak, for we were traversing a sort of high, wind-swept plateau. As we drove, I saw a road that looked but little used, and which seemed to dip through a little, winding valley. It looked so inviting that, even at the risk of offending him, I called Johann to stop--and when he had pulled up, I told him I would like to drive down that road. He made all sorts of excuses, and frequently crossed himself as he spoke. This somewhat piqued my curiosity, so I asked him various questions. He answered fencingly, and repeatedly looked at his watch in protest. Finally I said: 'Well, Johann, I want to go down this road. I shall not ask you to come unless you like; but tell me why you do not like to go, that is all I ask.' For answer he seemed to throw himself off the box, so quickly did he reach the ground. Then he stretched out his hands appealingly to me, and implored me not to go. There was just enough of English mixed with the German for me to understand the drift of his talk. He seemed always just about to tell me something--the very idea of which evidently frightened him; but each time he pulled himself up, saying, as he crossed himself: 'Walpurgis-Nacht!' I tried to argue with him, but it was difficult to argue with a man when I did not know his language. The advantage certainly rested with him, for although he began to speak in English, of a very crude and broken kind, he always got excited and broke into his native tongue--and every time he did so, he looked at his watch. Then the horses became restless and sniffed the air. At this he grew very pale, and, looking around in a frightened way, he suddenly jumped forward, took them by the bridles and led them on some twenty feet. I followed, and asked why he had done this. For answer he crossed himself, pointed to the spot we had left and drew his carriage in the direction of the other road, indicating a cross, and said, first in German, then in English: 'Buried him--him what killed themselves.' I remembered the old custom of burying suicides at cross-roads: 'Ah! I see, a suicide. How interesting!' But for the life of me I could not make out why the horses were frightened. Whilst we were talking, we heard a sort of sound between a yelp and a bark. It was far away; but the horses got very restless, and it took Johann all his time to quiet them. He was pale, and said, 'It sounds like a wolf--but yet there are no wolves here now.' 'No?' I said, questioning him; 'isn't it long since the wolves were so near the city?' 'Long, long,' he answered, 'in the spring and summer; but with the snow the wolves have been here not so long.' Whilst he was petting the horses and trying to quiet them, dark clouds drifted rapidly across the sky. The sunshine passed away, and a breath of cold wind seemed to drift past us. It was only a breath, however, and more in the nature of a warning than a fact, for the sun came out brightly again. Johann looked under his lifted hand at the horizon and said: 'The storm of snow, he comes before long time.' Then he looked at his watch again, and, straightway holding his reins firmly--for the horses were still pawing the ground restlessly and shaking their heads--he climbed to his box as though the time had come for proceeding on our journey. I felt a little obstinate and did not at once get into the carriage. 'Tell me,' I said, 'about this place where the road leads,' and I pointed down. Again he crossed himself and mumbled a prayer, before he answered, 'It is unholy.' 'What is unholy?' I enquired. 'The village.' 'Then there is a village?' 'No, no. No one lives there hundreds of years.'",0,0.0

"Hey there everyone! It's been a while since I last shared some personal reflections and updates on various subjects. Life has been a rollercoaster lately, with ups and downs, but I'm excited to catch you up on what's been going on in my world. So grab a cup of coffee or your favorite beverage, and let's dive in!

First things first, let's talk about gymnastics. I've been practicing and competing in gymnastics for years now, and it continues to be one of my passions. The feeling of being able to defy gravity and execute those flips and tricks is simply exhilarating. Lately, I've been focusing on perfecting my routines and pushing myself to learn new skills. It's challenging, but the progress I'm making feels incredibly rewarding.

On a not-so-glamorous note, I recently dealt with being sick. It's never fun, but it gave me a chance to slow down and reflect on my health. Taking care of my body has become a top priority, and I've been incorporating healthier habits into my daily routine. From eating nourishing foods to getting enough rest, I've definitely learned the importance of self-care.

Now, let's switch gears a bit and talk about attraction. It's something we all experience, and lately, I've been reflecting on what attracts me to others. It's not just about physical appearance, but also a person's energy, kindness, and the way they make me feel. I've come to appreciate the beauty in various forms and have learned not to be judgmental based solely on looks.

Speaking of looks, let's talk about haircare. I've always had a love-hate relationship with my hair. Some days it cooperates, while other days it has a mind of its own. However, I've recently discovered some fabulous hair products that have been a game-changer. Learning how to embrace and style my hair has been a confidence booster, and I'm enjoying experimenting with different hairstyles.

Now, let's move on to music preferences. As an avid music lover, my taste in music is quite eclectic. From pop to indie, rock to classical, I appreciate a wide range of genres. Lately, I've been exploring new artists and rediscovering old favorites. Music has this incredible power to uplift my mood and transport me to another place, and I'm grateful for its presence in my life.

On a more serious note, I've been contemplating the idea of starting my own business. I've always had an entrepreneurial spirit, and the idea of being my own boss is incredibly enticing. I've been brainstorming potential ideas and doing some research to explore different options. It's both exciting and nerve-wracking, but I'm ready to take on the challenge and see where it leads me.

In addition to gymnastics and business aspirations, I've also been nurturing my love for photography. There's something magical about capturing moments and freezing them in time. Whether it's a stunning landscape or the smile on a loved one's face, photography allows me to express myself in a unique way. I've been practicing and honing my skills, and I hope to delve deeper into this passion of mine.

Of course, school is still a big part of my life. Balancing academics, extracurricular activities, and a social life can be quite overwhelming at times. But I've learned the importance of time management and setting realistic goals. Education is a privilege, and I'm committed to making the most of it, even on the toughest of days.

In this digital age, online interests are impossible to ignore. I've been exploring various online communities and platforms that align with my interests. Whether it's connecting with like-minded individuals, learning new things, or simply indulging in entertainment, the online world offers a vast array of possibilities. It's all about striking a balance between online and offline experiences.

Finally, let's talk about my writing style. I've always been passionate about writing and expressing myself through words. Whether it's creative writing, blogging, or jotting down my thoughts in a journal, writing serves as a therapeutic outlet for me. I've been experimenting with different styles and genres, and it's a constant journey of growth and self-discovery.

Phew, that was quite a whirlwind of topics! I hope you enjoyed catching up on my personal reflections and updates. Life is a constant journey, and I'm excited to see where it takes me. Remember, it's essential to take some time for self-reflection and pursue your passions. Thanks for joining me on this heartfelt chat, and until next time, take care and keep being amazing!",1,0.0
"<h2> AUTHOR&rsquo;S NOTE </h2> <p> The six stories in this volume are the result of some three or four years of occasional work. The dates of their writing are far apart, their origins are various. None of them are connected directly with personal experiences. In all of them the facts are inherently true, by which I mean that they are not only possible but that they have actually happened. For instance, the last story in the volume, the one I call Pathetic, whose first title is Il Conde (misspelt by-the-by) is an almost verbatim transcript of the tale told me by a very charming old gentleman whom I met in Italy. I don&rsquo;t mean to say it is only that. Anybody can see that it is something more than a verbatim report, but where he left off and where I began must be left to the acute discrimination of the reader who may be interested in the problem. I don&rsquo;t mean to say that the problem is worth the trouble. What I am certain of, however, is that it is not to be solved, for I am not at all clear about it myself by this time. All I can say is that the personality of the narrator was extremely suggestive quite apart from the story he was telling me. I heard a few years ago that he had died far away from his beloved Naples where that &ldquo;abominable adventure&rdquo; did really happen to him. </p> <p> Thus the genealogy of Il Conde is simple. It is not the case with the other stories. Various strains contributed to their composition, and the nature of many of those I have forgotten, not having the habit of making notes either before or after the fact. I mean the fact of writing a story. What I remember best about Gaspar Ruiz is that it was written, or at any rate begun, within a month of finishing Nostromo; but apart from the locality, and that a pretty wide one (all the South American Continent), the novel and the story have nothing in common, neither mood, nor intention and, certainly, not the style. The manner for the most part is that of General Santierra, and that old warrior, I note with satisfaction, is very true to himself all through. Looking now dispassionately at the various ways in which this story could have been presented I can&rsquo;t honestly think the General superfluous. It is he, an old man talking of the days of his youth, who characterizes the whole narrative and gives it an air of actuality which I doubt whether I could have achieved without his help. In the mere writing his existence of course was of no help at all, because the whole thing had to be carefully kept within the frame of his simple mind. But all this is but a laborious searching of memories. My present feeling is that the story could not have been told otherwise. The hint for Gaspar Ruiz the man I found in a book by Captain Basil Hall, R.N., who was for some time, between the years 1824 and 1828, senior officer of a small British Squadron on the West Coast of South America. His book published in the thirties obtained a certain celebrity and I suppose is to be found still in some libraries. The curious who may be mistrusting my imagination are referred to that printed document, Vol. II, I forget the page, but it is somewhere not far from the end. Another document connected with this story is a letter of a biting and ironic kind from a friend then in Burma, passing certain strictures upon &ldquo;the gentleman with the gun on his back&rdquo; which I do not intend to make accessible to the public. Yet the gun episode did really happen, or at least I am bound to believe it because I remember it, described in an extremely matter-of-fact tone, in some book I read in my boyhood; and I am not going to discard the beliefs of my boyhood for anybody on earth. </p> <p> The Brute, which is the only sea-story in the volume, is, like Il Conde, associated with a direct narrative and based on a suggestion gathered on warm human lips. I will not disclose the real name of the criminal ship but the first I heard of her homicidal habits was from the late Captain Blake, commanding a London ship in which I served in 1884 as Second Officer. Captain Blake was, of all my commanders, the one I remember with the greatest affection. I have sketched in his personality, without however mentioning his name, in the first paper of The Mirror of the Sea. In his young days he had had a personal experience of the brute and it is perhaps for that reason that I have put the story into the mouth of a young man and made of it what the reader will see. The existence of the brute was a fact. The end of the brute as related in the story is also a fact, well-known at the time though it really happened to another ship, of great beauty of form and of blameless character, which certainly deserved a better fate. I have unscrupulously adapted it to the needs of my story thinking that I had there something in the nature of poetical justice. I hope that little villainy will not cast a shadow upon the general honesty of my proceedings as a writer of tales. </p> <p> Of The Informer and An Anarchist I will say next to nothing. The pedigree of these tales is hopelessly complicated and not worth disentangling at this distance of time. I found them and here they are. The discriminating reader will guess that I have found them within my mind; but how they or their elements came in there I have forgotten for the most part; and for the rest I really don&rsquo;t see why I should",0,0.0
"Barbara was a remarkable woman. Her intelligence radiated from her every word, every action. She had a voracious appetite for knowledge and an insatiable curiosity that was infectious. I was lucky enough to be close to her, to witness her thirst for learning firsthand.

From an early age, Barbara showed signs of brilliance. She excelled in school, effortlessly grasping concepts that seemed to baffle others. She devoured books, losing herself in the worlds of great thinkers and captivating novels. Her intellect was a force to be reckoned with, and yet, she remained humble and down-to-earth.

But intelligence was not the only extraordinary thing about Barbara. She was a dedicated mother, a loving wife, and a pillar of strength for her family. Her children were her world, and she sacrificed so much for their well-being. She put her dreams on hold, her thirst for knowledge momentarily quenched, as she poured her heart and soul into raising her kids.

And yet, as her children grew older, I couldn't help but notice a stark contrast between Barbara and her offspring. While she continued to pursue intellectual endeavors, attending lectures, reading voraciously, and engaging in discussions with like-minded individuals, her children seemed indifferent to the world of ideas.

It saddened me to witness this lack of intellectual curiosity in Barbara's children. It felt as though a part of her essence, her passion for knowledge, had not been inherited. They seemed content with the mundane, with the superficial. They were more interested in the latest trends, the trivial gossip, rather than exploring the depths of human understanding.

It was a source of frustration and disappointment for Barbara. She had hoped to share her love for learning with her children, to ignite a spark within them that would drive them to seek knowledge and expand their horizons. But it seemed as though her efforts had fallen on deaf ears.

I often wondered why Barbara's children lacked the intellectual curiosity that she possessed. Was it a result of the changing times, the influence of the digital age? Or was it simply a matter of different interests and priorities? Perhaps they were content with their lives, finding fulfillment in other aspects that escaped Barbara's understanding.

But it was hard for me to accept this. I had seen the fire in Barbara's eyes when she delved into a new subject, the excitement that bubbled within her when she discovered a fresh perspective. It was a passion that I had always admired, and to see it go unappreciated by her own children was disheartening.

In reflecting on Barbara's life, her intelligence, and the lack of intellectual curiosity in her children, I couldn't help but wonder about the intricate dynamics of family. How do we pass on our values, our passions, to the next generation? Is it something that can be taught, or is it a trait that can only be nurtured from within?

I am grateful for the time I spent with Barbara, for the lessons she taught me and the inspiration she provided. She showed me the importance of intellectual curiosity, of never ceasing to learn and grow. And while it may be disappointing to see her children not inherit that same thirst for knowledge, I take solace in knowing that Barbara's impact on my own life was immeasurable.

In the end, I suppose it is not our place to judge or impose our own values onto others. Each person's journey is unique, and what brings one fulfillment may not resonate with another. But I will always cherish the memories of Barbara, her intelligence, and the lessons she taught me. She was an extraordinary woman who left an indelible mark on those fortunate enough to know her.",1,0.0

"Challenger 3 (CR3) is a planned British main battle tank in development for the British Army. It will be produced by conversion of existing Challenger 2 tanks by the British/German Rheinmetall BAE Systems Land joint venture. Improvements to Challenger 2 began in 2005 as the Capability And Sustainment Programme (CSP) to keep the Challenger 2 competitive until the 2030s. Lack of funding[12] meant that it wasn't until 2014 that the programme was formally reorganised into the ""Challenger 2 Life Extension Programme"" (LEP). In response to the LEP programme, two prototypes were submitted for evaluation; one from BAE Systems in 2018[13] and the other from Rheinmetall in 2019.[14] Later that year BAE and Rheinmetall merged their British operations into Rheinmetall BAE Systems Land (RBSL), effectively leaving Rheinmetall's proposal the only option available without replacing the Challenger 2 fleet with non-indigenous models.[15] The Challenger 3 has an all-new turret with an improved hull. The most significant change from Challenger 2 to Challenger 3 is the replacement of the Challenger's main armament from a 120 mm L30A1 rifled main gun to the 120 mm L55A1[16] smoothbore gun (which itself is an upgraded version of the L55 fitted to the Leopard 2A6/A7 family of main battle tanks) giving commonality with other NATO members. Ammunition is to be developed in conjunction with Rheinmetall AG, with a new kinetic energy round being developed for Challenger 3 and Leopard 2.[17] The Challenger 3 will be the fourth tank of this name, the first being the World War II Cruiser Mk VIII Challenger, which was developed from the Cromwell tank chassis and armed with a Ordnance QF 17-pounder. The second was the Gulf War-era Challenger 1, which was the British army's main battle tank (MBT) from the early 1980s to the mid-1990s when it was succeeded by the Challenger 2 which saw action following the Iraq War in 2003.[citation needed] In 2005, the MOD recognised a need for a Capability Sustainment Programme (CSP) to extend the service life of the Challenger 2 into the mid-2030s and upgrade its mobility, lethality and survivability.[18] The CSP was planned to be complete by 2020 and was to combine all the upgrades from CLIP[clarification needed], including the fitting of a 120 mm smoothbore gun.[19][20] By 2014, the CSP programme had been replaced by the Life Extension Programme (LEP) which shared a similar scope of replacing obsolete components and extending the tank's service life from 2025 to 2035, however the 120 mm smoothbore gun had seemingly been abandoned.[21][22][23] In 2015, the British Army provided an insight into the scope of the LEP, dividing it into four key areas, namely:[24] The MOD also began assessing active protection systems (APS) on the Challenger 2, including MUSS and Rheinmetall's ROSY Rapid Obscurant System.[25][26][27] In August 2016, the MOD awarded assessment phase contracts to several companies for the Life Extension Programme. These included Team Challenger 2 (a consortium led by BAE Systems and including General Dynamics UK),[28] CMI Defence and Ricardo plc, Rheinmetall and Lockheed Martin UK.[29][30] In November, the MOD shortlisted two teams led by BAE Systems and Rheinmetall to compete for the LEP which was then estimated to be worth £650 million ($802 million).[31][32][33] In October 2018, BAE Systems unveiled its proposed Challenger 2 LEP technology demonstrator, the ""Black Night"".[34] The new improvements included a Safran PASEO commander’s sight, Leonardo thermal imager for the gunner and Leonardo DNVS 4 night sight.[citation needed] The turret also received modifications to improve the speed of traverse and to provide greater space as well as regenerative braking to generate and store power. Other enhancements included a laser warning system and an active protection system.[34] In January 2019, Rheinmetall unveiled its proposal which included the development of a completely new turret with fully digital electronic architecture, day and night sights for the commander and gunner, and a Rheinmetall L55 120 mm smoothbore gun. Whilst a more substantial upgrade than Black Night, the turret was developed on Rheinmetall's initiative and was not funded by the UK MOD, nor was it part of the MOD's LEP requirements.[35] In June 2019, BAE Systems and Rheinmetall formed a joint venture company, based in the UK, named Rheinmetall BAE Systems Land (RBSL).[36] Despite the merger, the company was still expected to present two separate proposals for the LEP contract,[citation needed].[37] At DSEI 2019, RBSL first showed the 120mm proposal.[38] In July 2020, Rheinmetall Defence showed a testbed vehicle on the Challenger 2 chassis, with a brand new turret, autoloading system and a powerful 130 mm smoothbore gun, the Rheinmetall Rh-130 L/51.[39] The 130 mm L/51 is 500 kilograms heavier than existing 120 mm L/44 or L/55 cannons and would require a larger turret to work on the Challenger 3.[40] In October 2020, the MOD argued against buying a new main battle tank from overseas instead of pursuing the Challenger 2 LEP, stating that an upgraded Challenger 2 would ""be comparable—and in certain areas superior—to Leopard 2 or M1 Abrams"".[41] The management of the C2 LEP was scathingly criticized by the Defence Select Committee on 15 March 2021.[42] They said in a report entitled ""Obsolescent and outgunned: the British Army's armoured vehicle capability"",[43] that ""Despite having spent around 50% of the allocated budget (£800 million), the programme has yet to place a manufacturing contract. The programme has a current in-service date of 2024 (originally planned for 2017) and is some £227 million over budget. After a decade of effort, this abject failure to deliver against both cost, (with an overrun now totalling over a quarter of a billion pounds of public money) and timescale (ISD seven years late) is clearly totally unacceptable. Nevertheless, it is symptomatic of the extremely weak management of Army equipment programmes, by both Defence Equipment and Support and the Army Board itself, in recent years.""[44] On 22 March 2021, Ben Wallace presented the command paper, Defence in a Competitive Age to Parliament, which confirmed the British Army's plans to upgrade 148 Challenger 2 tanks for ""around £1.3bn"" and designate them Challenger 3.[45][46]",0,0.0
"I still remember the day I first walked into Mr. Thompson's classroom. Fresh-faced and eager, I had no idea how this remarkable man would change my life. He was more than just a teacher – he was a mentor, a friend, and a guiding light. It's been years since he passed away, but the memories of his impact on my life remain vivid and powerful.

Mr. Thompson was unlike any teacher I had ever encountered. He had a unique way of making every lesson come alive, infusing his classes with passion and enthusiasm. He didn't just teach us a subject; he made us fall in love with it. Whether it was literature, science, or history, he had a way of igniting a spark within each of his students. His innovative teaching methods challenged us to think critically and encouraged us to explore beyond the confines of textbooks.

But what set Mr. Thompson apart was his unwavering belief in his students. He saw something in each of us that we couldn't always see in ourselves. He had a knack for bringing out the best in everyone, nurturing our strengths and pushing us to reach our full potential. He taught us not only the importance of academic excellence but also the value of kindness, empathy, and perseverance.

Beyond the classroom, Mr. Thompson made an effort to connect with each of his students on a personal level. He took the time to listen, to offer guidance, and to celebrate our successes. He created an atmosphere of trust and respect, where we felt safe to express our thoughts and opinions without fear of judgment. He treated us as equals, not just as students.

Looking back, I realize how fortunate I was to have had Mr. Thompson as my teacher. He not only shaped my academic journey but also influenced my character and worldview. He taught me to question, to think critically, and to never settle for mediocrity. His lessons extended far beyond the classroom walls and prepared me for the challenges that lay ahead.

When I received the news of his passing, a wave of grief washed over me. I felt an immense void, as if I had lost a part of myself. Regret seeped into my heart as I realized that I hadn't kept in touch with him over the years. Life had gotten busy, priorities had shifted, and I had failed to reach out to the person who had left an indelible mark on my life.

But as I grappled with my grief and regret, I also found solace in the memories we shared. I remembered the laughter and the passionate debates in his classroom. I recalled the countless times he had praised my efforts and encouraged me to keep pushing myself. And I realized that his legacy lives on through the countless lives he touched.

Though Mr. Thompson may no longer be physically present, his teachings and his spirit continue to guide me. I strive to live up to the lessons he imparted, to approach life with the same curiosity and passion he instilled in me. I often find myself asking, ""What would Mr. Thompson do?"" in challenging situations, drawing strength from the beliefs he instilled in us.

As time goes on, the pain of his loss may ease, but his memory will forever remain etched in my heart. I will cherish the time I spent under his tutelage, the lessons he taught me both inside and outside the classroom, and the personal connection we shared. Though he may no longer be physically present, his impact lives on in the lives of his students.

To all the teachers out there, I urge you to embrace your role not just as educators but as mentors and guides. You have the power to shape young minds, to nurture their potential, and to leave an everlasting imprint on their lives. Teach with passion, treat your students with respect, and never underestimate the impact you can have on their futures.

In loving memory of Mr. Thompson, who taught me not only the subject matter but also the value of lifelong learning, compassion, and the pursuit of excellence. Thank you for believing in me and for being the teacher I will never forget.",1,0.0
"Max Kayser was a prominent figure in the German Social Democratic Party (SPD) during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He was born on August 8, 1850, in Berlin, Germany. Kayser's early life was marked by a strong emphasis on education, and he attended the prestigious Friedrich-Wilhelm-Gymnasium in Berlin before going on to study law at the University of Berlin.

Kayser's interest in politics began to develop during his time at university, where he became involved in various student organizations. However, it was his engagement with the emerging workers' movement that would shape his political career. In the early 1870s, Kayser joined the SPD, a political party that advocated for the rights and interests of the working class.

In addition to his political activities, Kayser pursued a career in journalism. He gained recognition as a talented writer and commentator, specializing in political analysis and social issues. His insightful articles and editorials made him a respected figure in the German political and intellectual circles of the time.

Kayser's political involvement extended beyond his journalism career. He actively participated in party congresses, contributing to the policy-making and ideological development of the SPD. His contributions were particularly influential during his tenure as a member of the Reichstag, the German parliament, where he represented the interests of the working class.

Despite his successes, Kayser faced numerous challenges throughout his career. One such obstacle was the Anti-Socialist Laws introduced in Germany by the conservative government in the 1870s. These laws aimed to suppress the growing influence of the socialist movement, imposing restrictions on socialist organizations and activities. Kayser, like many other socialists, faced persecution and repression due to these laws, which hindered his political activities.

In addition to his political and journalistic endeavors, Kayser also co-founded a tobacco and cigar business, which allowed him to sustain himself financially while pursuing his political ambitions. This venture provided him with a degree of independence and stability during a tumultuous period in German history.

Max Kayser's commitment to social democracy and his tireless efforts to champion the rights of the working class established him as one of the leading figures of the SPD. His intellectual contributions, both as a journalist and a politician, helped shape the party's ideology and policies.

Max Kayser's life and career reflect the challenges faced by social democrats in Germany during a time of significant political and social change. His dedication to political activism, as well as his insightful commentary, illustrate his commitment to improving the lives of the working class and advancing the cause of social justice. Kayser's legacy lives on in the history of the SPD and in the broader struggle for workers' rights and social democracy in Germany.",1,0.0
"George W. Bush's presidency, spanning from 2001 to 2009, was a tumultuous and controversial period in American history. Despite his claims of being a ""compassionate conservative,"" Bush's policies and actions left a lasting impact on the United States and the world, shaping the course of domestic and foreign affairs. While some may argue that he achieved significant accomplishments, it is important to closely examine his presidency and its legacy.

One of Bush's major accomplishments was the passage of the No Child Left Behind Act in 2002. This legislation aimed to improve the quality of education by implementing strict accountability measures for schools and teachers. While the goal of improving education is commendable, critics argue that the Act placed too much emphasis on standardized testing, creating an environment of teaching to the test rather than fostering critical thinking skills. Additionally, the Act was underfunded, leading to strained resources and an inability to adequately support struggling schools.

Bush's response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks was another defining aspect of his presidency. His administration launched the War on Terror, invading Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003. The decision to invade Iraq was heavily criticized and remains one of the most controversial actions of his presidency. The rationale for the invasion, namely the presence of weapons of mass destruction, was ultimately proven to be false. The Iraq War resulted in the loss of thousands of American and Iraqi lives, destabilizing the region and contributing to the rise of extremist groups like ISIS.

Another notable aspect of Bush's presidency was his handling of the economy. In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, the Bush administration implemented a series of bailout measures to stabilize the banking sector. While these actions may have prevented a complete collapse of the financial system, they also drew criticism for rewarding the same institutions that had contributed to the crisis. The subsequent recession, marked by high unemployment rates and declining economic growth, had long-lasting consequences for many Americans.

Furthermore, Bush's administration was plagued by controversies and accusations of misconduct. The most significant among these was the revelation of the use of enhanced interrogation techniques, including waterboarding, on suspected terrorists. These practices were widely condemned both domestically and internationally as torture, tarnishing the United States' reputation and violating human rights standards. Additionally, the Bush administration's warrantless wiretapping program raised concerns about civil liberties and the erosion of privacy rights.

Another issue that marred Bush's presidency was his response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The slow and inadequate federal response to the disaster exposed major flaws in the government's ability to handle emergencies and highlighted the disproportionate impact on marginalized communities. The handling of Katrina further deepened the perception of a disconnect between the administration and the needs of the American people, eroding public trust in the government's ability to effectively respond to crises.

It is important to acknowledge that Bush did have some achievements during his presidency. For example, he implemented the Medicare prescription drug benefit, expanding access to healthcare for senior citizens. Additionally, his administration played a role in the fight against HIV/AIDS, particularly in Africa, through initiatives like the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). However, these achievements are often overshadowed by the controversies and failures that defined much of his presidency.

In conclusion, George W. Bush's presidency was marked by significant accomplishments and failures that had far-reaching consequences for the United States and the world. His policies and actions, ranging from education reform to the Iraq War, continue to shape domestic and foreign affairs to this day. While some may argue that he had success in certain areas, his administration was plagued by controversies and questionable decisions that tarnished his legacy. It is crucial to critically analyze his presidency to fully understand its impact on the nation.",1,0.0

"Title: Vietnam Veterans: Experiences and Challenges during and after the Vietnam War

Introduction:

The Vietnam War was one of the most defining moments in American history, leaving an indelible mark on the millions of men and women who served in the conflict. Among these brave individuals were the Vietnam veterans, who endured the harsh realities of war and faced numerous challenges upon their return home. This article aims to provide an informative and objective overview of the experiences of Vietnam veterans during and after the war.

1. Vietnam Veterans and their Service:

Vietnam veterans encompass all individuals who served in the active military forces during the Vietnam War era, from 1955 to 1975. It is important to distinguish between ""in-country"" veterans, who served in Vietnam directly, and ""Vietnam-era"" veterans, who served elsewhere during the war. Roughly 2.7 million Americans served in Vietnam, with the majority being enlisted soldiers and a significant number of draftees.

2. Historical Context and the Role of Other Nations:

The Vietnam War was a result of the Cold War tensions and the spread of communism in Southeast Asia. The United States, along with its allies, formed an anti-communist coalition to support South Vietnam in their struggle against the communist North. Other nations, including Australia, South Korea, and New Zealand, also deployed troops to Vietnam to aid the American-led efforts.

3. Challenges Faced by Vietnam Veterans:

a) Physical and Psychological Trauma:
Vietnam veterans faced immense physical and psychological challenges during their service. The hostile environment, guerrilla warfare tactics, and constant threat of ambushes took a toll on their physical well-being. Additionally, the war's unpopularity, lack of clear objectives, and the difficulty in distinguishing friend from foe often led to intense psychological stress.

b) Reintegration into Civilian Life:
The transition from the battlefield to civilian life was a challenging process for many Vietnam veterans. Unlike previous wars, their return was marred by widespread anti-war sentiment, resulting in a lack of public support and respect. Veterans often faced difficulties finding employment, readjusting to family life, and battling physical and mental health issues.

4. Impact on Mental Health:

The Vietnam War had a lasting impact on the mental health of many veterans. Studies have shown that a significant number of Vietnam veterans suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety. The horrors of war, witnessing and participating in traumatic events, and the loss of comrades contributed to these mental health challenges. Substance abuse, particularly the use of drugs like marijuana and heroin, also became prevalent among some servicemen as a mechanism to cope with the stress.

5. Support and Recognition:

Over time, the public's perception of Vietnam veterans has shifted, and efforts have been made to recognize their sacrifices and address their unique needs. Organizations such as the Vietnam Veterans of America (VVA) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provide crucial support and resources to assist veterans in accessing healthcare, employment opportunities, and compensation for service-related disabilities. Furthermore, national memorials, such as the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C., serve as powerful symbols of remembrance and acknowledgment.

Conclusion:

Vietnam veterans faced numerous challenges during their service and upon returning home. Their experiences were shaped by the complexities of the Vietnam War, the physical and psychological toll of combat, and the difficulties of reintegration into civilian life. Understanding the struggles faced by Vietnam veterans and providing them with the support they deserve is essential to honoring their service and ensuring their well-being.",1,0.0
"Alright, last night's post probably got a little bit fuzzy (aw, how cute!) because I continuously began to nod off. It was probably from the sleep pattern from the previous couple of days. Oh well, I am good now. Today, I do not even remember waking up really. Nevermind, got it. My dad yelled for me to come to breakfast. That is a decent thing to wake up to. ""Home-cooked food, something that you learn a fine appreciation for in the FIRST robotics program"" - Jonathan D. Fournier circa 2000. How true. Too bad last night I ate a lot lol. Do not give me that look. I'm serious. Ate Andy Capp's Hot Fries (a lot of them) with Sobe green tea at the rest stop, chicken/spinach salad from Wendy's, baked potato from Wendy's, and then two chocolate chip cookies at the bowling alley. I wanted starchy things for whatever reason. It was bizzare, and I kept mocking it. But anyways, back on track, kids. I want to walk that huge hill again...odd. Two graduation parties today which I nearly somehow forgot about. Wrote up shell cards for both James and Marie. Yes, a shell card for James...muhuhahaha. Walked to Marie's house, not trusting myself with her gift. She will get it eventually. For those who do not know, it was a birthday/graduation party. Now spiffy is that? Got there and chilled with her and her friend Jennifer from Enfield. Played a bit of soccer before Marie opened gifts and then I had to run over to James. His friend Jill gave him a DVD. A wonderful DVD I might add. Monty Python and the Holy Grail I might add. Beautious. We watched that and go figure everyone there knew it all lol. We want to make a broadway version...so be prepared for that. James noted my lack of hyperness-i-tude, buddy. Poo, I was still tired, and am a bit depressed from missing someone. Hell, James never met the kid and he said something along the lines of Tycho being the best for me. Thank you for that James. Remember, Tuesday...it is you, Monika, myself, and Eric the Viking lol. You need to tell me what food to have. I already know that I need root beer for you. I will give you more details such as timeage later. So today was decent, I enjoyed it anyways. I need to go to WalMart and get my glasses fixed. This whole ""falling off of my face"" thing is really ticking me off. Arg. Anyways, more of what I did not stay awake for last night. I mostly just wanted to include more details and more of how I felt I suppose. If you are uninterested you may stop reading here. Yes, that means you, the reader, who is reading this. I thought that I was so sure of myself and what I had planned to do the instant that I saw Matt. Whoops, how wrong of me. I froze. It felt like everything in my freaking body condensed and I could not have been more happy. I guess it was a good thing that I did not run to him, because his rents probably would have liked to injure me. Actually we did not even go near each other for a few minutes. I wanted to, but I was not sure if he wanted me to. So we all sat there. Tossed the frisbee a bit and talked - but mainly just sat there. We moved to go and play frisbee 'n such. Finally got a hug though. Back at bench, pool. Finally got what I had wanted next to the hug there. I felt awkward because of Shawn, but I warned him...and I should not have refrained from what I really wanted. That was the largest test of self control ever . Eh, I will skip some. Back to the bench lol. The bench. I want to go and steal that bench lol. Just being on that bench has brought me so much. It was there that I sat the times at Frontiers when Matt was the only person to give me the time of day, and no, for you information, no I did not ever tell him to do the proverbial ""piss off"". That bench...yay. lol :-D ;-) I have to eat, so posting is...er...postponed. Please enjoy this commercial break/intermission. La Ti Da - Gonna be a while? Grab a snickers! - C'mon down to Bob's Discount Funiture! - JC Penny's One Day Only Sale, where everything is 10, 20 30 % off! - Wendy's: Eat great, even late! Introducing the new Wendy's late-night pick-up window, open until 1 AM or later! - Make 7-Up Yours! Okay, okay. I'm done with that. The sad thing is - I really do not watch TV. Movies - yes, TV - no. Eh, some of those are pretty old though, from when I did, in fact, watch a bit of television. Back to Battlecry...or rather...what I did instead of Battlecry... Skipping...skipping...skipping...skipping...ah, okay. Near the wedge. Matt was kinda cold outside, and cars were being weird. Honestly, why would you watch a couple of kids ... er ... sitting on a bench? Anyways, we moved inside and chilled near some lockers. Besides the guy charging back and forth with the umbrella (which he sometimes opened! ::insert exaggerated gasp here:: . That was actually pretty funny. I enjoyed it anyways. That was where we missed the reservation at Sole P. because we were a bit um...preoccupied? Er...we were not hungry! Honestly! Then when we were hungry at like...what was it? 11:30pm? We decided to walk to that Eddie's place...where I think Tych got irritated because I was not going to eat...so I did eat. I was glad that I did, because I was pretty hungry and it helped with the energy part of things. Walked back to Claudio's ... rather quickly because it had gotten a bit more chilly and we were figuring on",0,0.0
"Southeast Toyota Distributors LLC, (SET) founded in 1968, is the top private distributor of Toyota vehicles in the world.[4][5][6] They are franchised by Toyota Motor Sales, USA to sell vehicles and parts to car dealerships in the five states of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina.[7] SET is a wholly owned subsidiary of JM Family Enterprises. Corporate headquarters of both are located at Deerfield Beach, Florida. Primary operations are located in Jacksonville, Florida.[8][9][1] In early 1968, Jim Moran was contacted by a friend from Chicago who said that Toyota wanted to establish a dealer network in the Southeastern United States and wanted to talk to him. Moran asked what a Toyota was. The company had been unsuccessful at breaking into the American market at the end of the 1950s and was trying again. Moran declined, but his friend was insistent that Moran drive one. According to Moran, he tested everything to see if it would break. While cruising at 55 mph on the interstate, Moran shifted into reverse, and the engine and transmission survived. Moran concluded that although Toyotas weren't as stylish or comfortable as domestic vehicles, they were well-built, reasonably priced, and destined to change the automotive business.[10] On October 26, 1968, he entered into an agreement to distribute Toyota vehicles from the Port of Jacksonville and Southeast Toyota Distributors (SET) was founded that year.[5] The first year, cars were sold to 42 dealerships by eleven associates in Pompano Beach, Florida.[8] SET sold their one millionth Toyota in 1982. At that time, there were 151 dealerships.[7] When Toyota introduced the Lexus brand to the U.S. in 1989,[11] SET began distributing them to their dealers in the Southeast. SET also began distributing the Scion brand in 2003.[12] The Financial crisis of 2007–2008 followed by the 2009–2011 Toyota vehicle recalls forced SET to offer severance packages to 79 associates in vehicle processing and parts in Jacksonville and 31 in Commerce, Georgia.[13] Southeast Toyota Distributors is the larger of the two private distributors of Toyota vehicles in the United States.[14][5] The other is Gulf States Toyota in Houston, founded by the late Thomas H. Friedkin.[15] Dealerships in the remaining areas of the United States are supplied by Toyota Motor Sales, USA.[14] Toyota Motor Sales opened seven manufacturing facilities in the US since 1984 and today, the majority of vehicles distributed by SET arrive by Rail transport, not ship.[5] In 2020, SET sold 434,033 vehicles, including 94,507 from fleet business.[3] On January 4, 2022, Brent Sergot was named president of Southeast Toyota Distributors, LLC, and executive vice president of parent company JM Family Enterprises, Inc. Sergot is responsible for directing the overall operation of Southeast Toyota, including three vehicle processing facilities, parts supply and distribution, and Southeast Transportation Systems, Inc., the company's automotive transport division. He also serves as a member of JM Family's Executive Management Team, which oversees the development and implementation of the company's long-range planning and strategies for future growth.[2] He replaced Ed Sheehy who served in those positions from July, 2008.[16] Ken Czubay preceded Sheehy from 1990.[17][18][19] SET has three vehicle processing facilities.[6] At each site, vehicles are prepared for sale, equipped with port-installed accessories, assigned to dealerships and loaded onto Car carrier trailers for transport to the dealerships.[12] Port-installed accessories add to the sale price of the vehicle. Some examples include running boards, floor mats, spoilers, roof racks, alloy wheels, and caliper covers.[3][5] The ship facility is SETs original vehicle center located on 75-acres at the Jacksonville Port Authority (JaxPort) Talleyrand terminal and has processed vehicles that arrive by ship since 1968.[20] 25 to 40% of Toyotas sold in the United States come from Japan, Turkey & France, and are processed by SET at the facility.[20][3] On April 25, 2022, Jaxport and SET jointly announced plans for SET to lease a new vehicle processing facility at nearby Blount Island. The new site will allow SET to redesign their operation for efficiency and increased capacity. Associate amenities available at other Jacksonville SET facilities will be added at the new location, expected to be completed by the end of 2024. Jaxport is currently working with the Florida Department of Transportation on a $45 million project to expand capacities at Blount Island. SET will contribute $16.5 million of that cost. The facility will then accommodate larger ships and permit two ships to berth simultaneously. The new site will have two vehicle processing buildings with a combined 250,000-square-foot (23,000 m2) versus 200,000-square-foot (19,000 m2); 88 acres (36 ha) versus 73 acres (30 ha) (non-contiguous) plus new CSX rail connections.[21] In 2002, Southeast Toyota opened a $53 million vehicle processing facility on 250-acres in the Westlake Industrial Park of northwest Jacksonville near Interstate 295.[12] Another parcel of 250-acres was acquired in 2005 for future use. There were 11 buildings encompassing 350,000-square-foot (33,000 m2) on 100-acres of paved parking and a 50-car rail head on Pritchard Road. A 20,000-square-foot (1,900 m2) central services building was constructed in 2015.[5] The 2005 reserve parcel was sold in 2020 for a $7 million profit.[22] SET's original Inland Processing facility at Commerce, Georgia was built in 1988 and staffed by 40 associates.[23] The all-rail location handles vehicles intended for distribution to dealers in Northern Alabama, Northern Georgia and the Carolinas.[24] By 2017, increased vehicle volume required 200 workers.[23] SET broke ground for their new complex on December 11, 2018, across Georgia State Route 334 from their existing center.[24] The new 350,000-square-foot (33,000 m2) facility includes a fitness center, expanded café, health center, meeting rooms and a nature trail. It was completed in April 2020 at a cost of $100 million. The 300-acre complex includes six buildings, 50 acres of pavement and six industrial spurs and sidings to offload vehicles from 90 Rail cars simultaneously.[25][24] Southeast Toyota Parts operates from a single, 410,000-square-foot (38,000 m2) warehouse[26] in Jacksonville. When Lexus automobiles were introduced in 1989, SET Parts became the distributor of Lexus parts. As volume of both Toyota and Lexus products increased, the decision was made in",0,0.0
"When I was a young deputy patrolman in San Francisco Bay, one of the biggest challenges we faced was dealing with the influx of Chinese shrimp-catchers and their notorious fishing techniques. These fishermen would come in massive numbers, their junks dotting the horizon as far as the eye could see. It was a sight that both fascinated and intimidated me.

The fishing boats that they used were unlike anything I had ever seen before. With their distinctive pointed bows and bright red sails, they stood out amidst the other vessels in the bay. These junks were sturdy and built to withstand the harsh conditions of the open sea. They were manned by a crew of skilled fishermen who knew the ins and outs of shrimp catching like the back of their hand.

The Chinese shrimp-catchers had a unique way of capturing their prey. They would drop large nets with weighted edges into the water, and then drag them along the seafloor. As they moved, the nets would scoop up shrimp, and anything else unlucky enough to be in their path. It was a highly effective technique, but one that had devastating consequences for the ecosystem.

The shrimp these fishermen were after were known as the Chinese Mitten Crab. These creatures were not only a delicacy in Chinese cuisine but were also highly invasive. They had been introduced to the bay years before and had quickly multiplied, causing significant damage to the native species and their habitats. The Chinese shrimp-catchers saw an opportunity to make a profit from these prolific crustaceans, and they seized it without hesitation.

One of the things that struck me the most about these shrimp-catchers was their incredible knowledge of the habits of shrimp. They seemed to have an innate understanding of when and where the shrimp would be, and they knew exactly how to capitalize on it. They would meticulously plan their expeditions, often waiting for days for the perfect conditions before setting sail.

But it wasn't just their fishing techniques that left an impression on me. The sight and smell of their boats were something I will never forget. The junks were often overcrowded with shrimp and other marine life, packed tightly into barrels and buckets. The stench of decaying fish hung heavy in the air, making it difficult to breathe. It was a constant reminder of the brutal reality of their trade.

As a deputy patrolman, it was my duty to enforce the fishing regulations of the bay and maintain order. This meant confronting the Chinese shrimp-catchers who were operating illegally or violating restrictions. It was often a dangerous and challenging task, as these fishermen were fiercely protective of their livelihoods.

There were times when we would catch them in the act, their nets full of illegally caught shrimp. We would board their junks, while they fought tooth and nail to defend their catches. It was a battle of wills, and I must admit, I respected their tenacity and determination.

On one occasion, we managed to capture a junk at the end of an intense chase. The Chinese shrimp-catchers on board put up a fight, but we eventually subdued them and confiscated their illegal catch. It was a small victory, but it served as a reminder that our efforts to protect the bay and its fragile ecosystem were not in vain.

In the end, the presence of the Chinese shrimp-catchers in San Francisco Bay was a complex issue. While their fishing techniques were destructive, they were also a testament to the resilience and resourcefulness of these fishermen. They were driven by the need to provide for their families and make a living in a foreign land.

Reflecting on my time as a deputy patrolman, I have come to appreciate the delicate balance between preserving the environment and understanding the human aspect of the story. The Chinese shrimp-catchers left a lasting impression on me, not only for their unique fishing techniques but also for their unwavering determination to overcome the challenges they faced. It was a chapter in the history of San Francisco Bay that I will never forget.",1,0.0
"Population proportion estimation is a fundamental concept in statistics that allows researchers to make inferences about a larger population based on information obtained from a smaller sample. It involves estimating the proportion of individuals in a population that possess a specific characteristic or exhibit a particular behavior. This estimation is crucial in various fields, including social sciences, market research, and public health, as it enables decision-makers to gather insights about a specific population without having to study each individual.

In statistical terms, a population proportion is denoted by the symbol p, which represents the proportion of individuals in a given population that possess a certain characteristic. For example, p could represent the proportion of people in a city who support a particular political candidate or the proportion of customers who are satisfied with a product.

To estimate the population proportion, researchers often use sampling methods. Sampling involves selecting a smaller subset, or sample, from the population to obtain information about the larger population. By analyzing the sample, researchers can gather insights and make inferences about the entire population.

One common method for estimating population proportions is simple random sampling. In simple random sampling, each individual in the population has an equal chance of being selected for the sample. This method ensures that the sample is representative of the population, allowing for accurate estimates.

Another commonly used method is stratified sampling. With stratified sampling, the population is divided into distinct subgroups, called strata, based on certain characteristics. Then, individuals are randomly selected from each stratum to form the sample. This method is useful when the population varies significantly in terms of the characteristic of interest, as it allows for more precise estimates within each stratum.

Once a sample is obtained, researchers can construct a confidence interval to estimate the population proportion. A confidence interval is a range of values that is likely to contain the true population proportion with a specified level of confidence. The level of confidence is typically expressed as a percentage, such as 95% or 99%.

To construct a confidence interval, researchers first calculate the sample proportion, denoted by p-hat. The sample proportion is the number of individuals in the sample who possess the characteristic of interest divided by the sample size. For example, if a sample of 100 individuals is surveyed, and 30 of them support a specific political candidate, the sample proportion would be 30/100 = 0.3.

Next, researchers determine the margin of error, which represents the maximum amount by which the sample proportion could deviate from the true population proportion. The margin of error is based on the chosen level of confidence and is influenced by the sample size. Larger sample sizes tend to produce smaller margins of error, leading to more precise estimates.

The margin of error is calculated by multiplying a critical value, which is determined based on the chosen level of confidence, by the standard error. The standard error accounts for the variability of the sample proportion and is calculated as the square root of [(p-hat * (1 - p-hat)) / n], where n represents the sample size.

Finally, the confidence interval is constructed by subtracting the margin of error from the sample proportion to obtain the lower bound and adding the margin of error to the sample proportion to obtain the upper bound. The result is an interval estimate for the population proportion.

For instance, suppose a researcher wants to estimate the proportion of adults in a city who own a smartphone. A random sample of 500 adults is surveyed, and it is found that 320 of them own a smartphone. Based on this information, the sample proportion is calculated as 320/500 = 0.64.

Let's assume that a 95% confidence level is selected. Using a standard normal distribution table, the critical value for a 95% confidence level is 1.96. The standard error is calculated as sqrt[(0.64 * (1 - 0.64)) / 500] = 0.021.

The margin of error is then 1.96 * 0.021 = 0.041.

The confidence interval can be constructed by subtracting the margin of error from the sample proportion (0.64 - 0.041 = 0.599) and adding the margin of error to the sample proportion (0.64 + 0.041 = 0.681). Therefore, the confidence interval for the population proportion of adults who own a smartphone would be 0.599 to 0.681.

Interpreting this interval, we can say with 95% confidence that the proportion of adults in the city who own a smartphone lies between 0.599 and 0.681.

In conclusion, population proportion estimation is essential in statistics as it allows researchers to make inferences about a larger population based on information obtained from a smaller sample. Sampling methods, such as simple random sampling and stratified sampling, are commonly used to estimate population proportions. Confidence intervals provide a range of values that likely contains the true population proportion with a specified level of confidence. By understanding and applying these statistical techniques, researchers can gather valuable insights that inform decision-making in various fields.",1,0.0
"Hansen, a crew member on the spaceship, was lounging in the break room when his peaceful moment was interrupted by a call from Captain Fromer. As he answered the communicator, he couldn't hide the hint of amusement in his voice.

""What's the emergency, Captain?"" Hansen asked, trying to suppress a smile.

""Hansen, we have a problem,"" Captain Fromer replied, his tone laced with frustration. ""The landing process is being delayed by a malfunctioning door. I need you to come help me out immediately.""

Hansen couldn't help but chuckle inwardly. Of all the emergencies he had dealt with during his time on the ship, a malfunctioning door was undoubtedly one of the least threatening. The thought of Captain Fromer, always so composed and self-assured, facing such a trivial issue brought an unexpected surge of pleasure to Hansen.

As he hurried through the spaceship's corridors, Hansen couldn't help but imagine the embarrassment Captain Fromer must be feeling. The captain, known for his impeccable leadership skills, was now in a situation where a simple door was causing a major inconvenience. Oh, the irony!

When Hansen arrived at the scene, he found Captain Fromer standing in front of the stubborn door, frustration etched across his face. With a barely concealed grin, Hansen approached him.

""Captain, it seems like we have a bit of a door situation here,"" Hansen said, fighting to suppress a laugh.

Captain Fromer shot him a glare. ""This isn't a laughing matter, Hansen. We need to resolve this immediately. We have an important passenger on board, and their schedule cannot be delayed any further.""

The mention of the important passenger only added to the urgency of the situation. Hansen's amusement quickly faded as he realized the potential implications of the malfunctioning door. Time to get serious, he thought.

They called for a repair ship, which arrived shortly after. The technicians on board examined the door, studying it closely. But to their dismay, they discovered that the spaceship's records lacked detailed drawings of the door mechanisms.

Hansen watched as the repair ship crew scratched their heads, frustration mirroring Captain Fromer's earlier expression. It seemed that fixing the door was not going to be as straightforward as they had hoped.

With the lack of detailed drawings, the repair crew had to rely on trial and error. They dismantled various parts of the door, carefully examining them before reassembling everything in a different configuration. But each attempt yielded no improvement.

Hours passed, and the tension grew. Captain Fromer, though trying to maintain his composure, was visibly worried. The important passenger was growing impatient, and the crew's reputation was on the line.

Hansen quietly observed the repair crew, a mixture of sympathy and frustration building up inside him. How could such a seemingly simple problem turn into such a complicated mess? The satisfaction he initially felt had turned into a deep desire for a quick resolution.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, one of the technicians made an unexpected discovery. Hidden beneath a panel, they found a tiny switch that had been inadvertently flipped, causing the door to malfunction. With a simple flick, the switch was reset, and the door came back to life.

Relief washed over the spaceship as the doors slid open smoothly, allowing the ship to finally proceed with the landing process. Captain Fromer's expression softened, a mixture of gratitude and exhaustion evident on his face.

As Hansen reflected on the events of the day, he realized that even the most seemingly insignificant problems could have significant consequences. He understood the frustration Captain Fromer must have felt and resolved to approach future emergencies with a more empathetic mindset.

The experience also served as a reminder that even the most thorough preparations could still be undone by tiny, unforeseen glitches. From that day forward, Hansen made it his mission to ensure that the spaceship's maintenance records were updated regularly, sparing any future crew from facing a similar predicament.

And as for the malfunctioning door, it became a legend among the ship's crew, a story that would be shared with equal parts frustration and amusement for years to come.",1,0.0
"Miryam's mind continued to wander, drifting in and out of the memories that had led her to this cold, sterile room. She thought back to the day she had discovered her unique abilities, the day she had learned she was different from others. It had started as a simple telepathic connection with her childhood friend, but as Miryam grew older, her powers expanded. She could communicate with multiple people at once, hear their thoughts and emotions, and even manipulate their actions. But her gifts had also brought her trouble, attracting the attention of the Geno-Service.

As the memories washed over her, Miryam felt a mix of pride and resentment. The Geno-Service saw her as nothing more than a specimen, a telepathic escapee to be captured and studied. They had underestimated her, assuming she was just like the others. But she was different. And now, lying on the cold bed in the midst of genetic experimentation, she had to summon all her strength to resist the urge to end it all.

In her moments of clarity, Miryam allowed her mind to drift towards the room where the Geno-Doctors were preparing for her arrival. She remembered the younger doctor, fresh from the Genetics Sanitarium, who had seemed surprised by her youthfulness. His curiosity had piqued her interest, momentarily giving her a glimmer of hope. But that hope was quickly extinguished by the Geno-Sar, a seasoned scientist wearing the gold trefoil of authority.

The Geno-Sar's booming voice filled her thoughts as he praised Miryam's exceptional psi rating. He spoke with pride about her abilities, touting her as the closest thing to a pure telepath they had ever encountered. Miryam's heart sank as she realized she was nothing more than a pawn in their scientific pursuits. The Geno-Sar went on to dismiss the young doctor's concerns about any emotional trauma she may have experienced, assuring him that it had not affected her telepathic powers. The spermatozoa used for the experiment were carefully chosen, preserved for decades to ensure the best genetic material.

As Miryam listened to the Geno-Sar's words, she couldn't help but feel a sense of resentment towards the coldness of the scientific community. They saw her abilities as nothing more than a puzzle to be solved, a means to further their own knowledge. The Geno-Sar reveled in the fact that genetics was finally gaining recognition as a crucial science, despite the skepticism from other disciplines. He boasted about a recent meeting where he had defended genetics and its potential to unravel the mysteries of heredity.

Caught up in his own enthusiasm, the Geno-Sar seemed to momentarily forget about Miryam's presence, his attention turning towards the young doctor. Miryam's unease grew as she watched the Geno-Sar appraise him, searching for signs of heresy. She had always seen scientists as distant and cold, but now she realized they were capable of much more. They were not just detached observers, but potential heretics, willing to go against the established norms of their field.

The Geno-Sar abruptly abandoned his scrutiny of the young doctor, praising his specialization and reminding him of the importance of individual expertise. Miryam couldn't help but feel a wave of resignation. In the world of genetic experimentation, she was nothing more than a test subject, a means to an end.

But as the pain throbbing through her body intensified, Miryam's defiant spirit resurfaced. She would not let herself be reduced to a mere specimen. She would fight against the powers that sought to control her, to understand her unique abilities at her expense. In that moment, as she lay on the cold, sterile bed, Miryam made a silent promise to herself. She would endure this torment, not just for her own sake, but for the countless others like her who had been silenced by the scientific community.

With renewed determination, Miryam clenched her fists, gritting her teeth against the pain. She would survive this ordeal and find a way to bring down the walls that imprisoned her kind. And as she waited for the effects of the capsule to take hold, she held onto that flicker of hope, the hope that one day she would be free from the clutches of the Geno-Service and their relentless pursuit of genetic experimentation.",1,-1.0
"The wind howled through the sails of the ship, carrying with it the icy bite of the treacherous sea. Cappen Varra, a bard from the south, huddled against the railing, his fingers numb from the relentless cold. He gazed out at the vast expanse of water, its waves crashing against the hull with a ferocity that matched his inner turmoil.

Cappen had joined this group of northern barbarians in search of adventure and inspiration for his songs, but now, as the ship battled against the raging storm, he couldn't help but question the wisdom of his decision. The wild, untamed nature of the north was far removed from the comforts of his homeland, and every passing day made him long for the warmth and familiarity he had left behind.

The ship carried them through uncharted waters, its crew hardened men who seemed immune to the harsh conditions. They laughed and sang, their boisterous voices resonating through the wind. Cappen, however, remained a solitary figure; his lute strapped securely to his back, now silent and untouched. The saltwater mingled with his tears, lost in the tempest that raged both within and without.

As days turned into weeks, the sea became both friend and foe. Its vastness offered a sense of freedom, a reminder that there was a world beyond the confines of safety and routine. The crashing waves became a symphony in Cappen's mind, a haunting melody that echoed his longing for a different life. But the sea also held a cruel power, unleashing its wrath with a fury that threatened to swallow the ship and its crew whole.

Cappen watched as the crew battled the elements, their muscles straining against the ropes, their faces etched with determination. He admired their resilience, their ability to find solace in the midst of chaos. But for him, the sea voyage had become a prison, a constant reminder of his own doubts and fears.

One night, as the storm raged on, Cappen sought solace in his cabin, his eyes drifting over the maps and parchments strewn across the table. He yearned for the pen, to spill his emotions onto the blank pages, to weave his experiences into stories that would capture the imaginations of those who would never know the harshness of the sea.

The ship creaked and groaned under the weight of the storm, its timbers straining against the relentless assault. Cappen clutched his lute, his fingers finding their way to the strings. The notes that flowed from his instrument were melancholic, a reflection of his own inner turmoil. The sound reverberated through the ship, reaching the ears of the weary crew.

As his voice joined the melody, Cappen's words carried the weight of his longing. His songs spoke of lost dreams, of homesickness, and the desire for a life that had slipped through his fingers. The crew, despite their rough exterior, found solace in the bard's music. They saw in his lyrics echoes of their own longings, and for a brief moment, the ship was transformed into a sanctuary of shared emotions.

The storm eventually subsided, leaving behind a sea battered and weary. Cappen, too, emerged from his emotional tempest, his songs having paved a path to acceptance. He had found a common thread among the crew, a connection that transcended the harsh conditions and cultural differences.

As the ship sailed on, its bow slicing through the calm waters, Cappen continued to strum his lute, his voice carrying tales of resilience and hope. And while he still yearned for the comforts of his homeland, he had found a new purpose in his journey. Through his music, he had become the bard of the sea, weaving stories of courage and perseverance that would be sung by generations to come.",1,0.0

"As an instructional designer and teacher, I have had the opportunity to work with different learning theories and apply them in a specific educational setting. One particular experience that stands out to me is working with a group of adult learners in a professional development program focused on technology integration in the classroom.

In this setting, the analysis phase of instructional design proved to be crucial. It involved gathering information about the learners, their needs, and the learning environment. By conducting interviews, surveys, and observations, I was able to gain valuable insights into their prior knowledge, learning preferences, and technological capabilities. This information helped me identify the gaps and determine the appropriate learning objectives for the program.

The analysis phase also involved understanding the institutional requirements and constraints. This included considering the available resources, time constraints, and the overall goals of the program. Balancing learner needs with institutional requirements can be challenging, as there may be conflicting expectations. However, by involving key stakeholders in the analysis process and clearly communicating the rationale behind the design decisions, I was able to navigate these challenges effectively.

Flexibility in instructional design has played a significant role in ensuring learner engagement and success. While it is essential to have a well-defined plan, being open to adaptation allows for addressing unexpected issues and integrating new findings. For example, during the implementation of the program, I discovered that some learners had a limited understanding of basic computer skills, which hindered their ability to effectively engage with the technology integration activities. To address this, I incorporated additional modules focused on basic computer literacy skills, providing the necessary scaffolding for their learning journey.

Moreover, the use of learning theories in instructional design has been instrumental in creating meaningful learning experiences. In this particular setting, one theory that greatly influenced my approach was constructivism. The learners were encouraged to actively participate in their own learning, construct their knowledge, and apply it in real-life contexts. This was achieved through hands-on activities, collaborative projects, and reflections. By emphasizing the ""learner as the center of learning,"" I was able to make the program more relevant, engaging, and applicable to their teaching practice.

However, it is important to note that there were challenges in balancing learner needs with institutional requirements. Institutions often have specific goals, standards, or assessments that need to be met. This sometimes created tension between what was ideal for the learners and what was necessary for institutional compliance. It required thoughtful negotiation, compromise, and careful consideration of the overarching goals of the program.

For instance, while the learners expressed a strong interest in exploring various technology tools and applications, there were time constraints that limited the depth of exploration for each tool. In such cases, I had to prioritize and select the most relevant tools that would have a significant impact on their teaching practice and align with institutional expectations. This required a deep understanding of the learners' needs and balancing it with the program's goals.

Overall, my experience with instructional design and learning theories in this educational setting has emphasized the significance of the analysis phase and the need for flexibility. The analysis phase helps in understanding the learners and their context, allowing for the design of targeted and effective learning experiences. Meanwhile, flexibility enables instructors to adapt and address the evolving needs of the learners, ensuring their engagement and success.

Balancing learner needs with institutional requirements proved to be challenging but not insurmountable. By involving key stakeholders and transparently communicating design decisions, compromises could be reached without compromising the overall effectiveness of the program. Ultimately, by applying learning theories and keeping the learner at the center of the design process, instructional designers and teachers can create impactful and meaningful learning experiences that prepare learners for success in their professional practice.",1,0.0
"Visiting my hometown of Troy after many years was a bittersweet experience. I returned to attend my grandmother's funeral, but the trip also gave me an opportunity to reconnect with the place that had shaped my childhood and adolescence. As I entered the city, memories flooded my mind, and I couldn't help but feel a wave of nostalgia wash over me.

One of the first places I visited was the cemetery where my grandparents were laid to rest. The peacefulness and serenity of the place brought back memories of countless visits with my family. I stood there, surrounded by tombstones and memories, and paid my respects to those who had played such an integral role in my life.

Next, I made my way to the church where I had attended Sunday services as a child. The familiar scent of incense and the sound of hymns being sung were like a time capsule, transporting me back to my younger days. I sat in the back pew, quietly reflecting on the lessons I had learned and the values that this church had instilled in me.

From there, I decided to take a stroll through the local garden center. This place had always been a sanctuary for me, a refuge from the chaos of everyday life. The vibrant colors and sweet fragrances of the flowers revived my spirit and reminded me of the joy I used to find in simple pleasures. I couldn't help but smile as I thought about the countless hours I had spent here, lost in my own little world.

As I continued my nostalgic journey, I found myself standing outside the old stadium where my high school football team used to play. The cheers of the crowd and the excitement of those Friday night lights came flooding back to me. I could almost hear the roar of the fans and feel the adrenaline pumping through my veins as I raced down the field. Those memories were etched deep within me, reminding me of the passion and camaraderie that had defined my teenage years.

Nearby, I visited my old high school, a place that had been both a sanctuary and a battleground. The hallways seemed smaller than I remembered, but the walls still held the echoes of laughter and tears. I walked through the familiar corridors, passing classrooms where I had sat through countless lessons, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of gratitude for the education and friendships that had shaped my formative years.

One of the highlights of my visit was returning to the arena where I had played in countless basketball games. Stepping onto the polished wooden floor, I felt a surge of nostalgia. The familiar smell of sweat and anticipation lingered in the air, and I closed my eyes, reliving the cheers of the crowd and the thrill of victory. This place had been my second home, a place where dreams were born and hard work paid off.

Of course, my journey wouldn't have been complete without visiting the homes of my family members. The sights and sounds of these familiar spaces brought back memories of laughter, love, and togetherness. Each house held its own special place in my heart, a testament to the bond we shared as a family. As I stood in these familiar rooms, I felt a profound sense of gratitude for the roots that took hold here.

No trip to Troy would be complete without a visit to the local park, where I had spent countless hours playing, laughing, and making memories with friends. The swings, the slides, and the smell of freshly cut grass reminded me of carefree days and endless possibilities. I couldn't help but smile as I watched children running and playing, knowing that they too were creating memories that would last a lifetime.

Before I left, there was one more place I wanted to visit - the local bookstore. This small, cozy space had always been my refuge, a treasure trove of knowledge and imagination. As I walked through the aisles, running my fingers along the spines of countless books, I couldn't help but feel a sense of longing. Troy had shaped my love for literature, and part of me yearned to return, to immerse myself once again in the stories and adventures that had ignited my imagination.

Leaving my hometown once again, I felt a mix of emotions. Troy had been the backdrop to my most formative years. It had witnessed my successes and failures, my joys and sorrows. It had molded me into the person I had become. As I looked back one last time, I couldn't help but wonder if there was a place for me in this city once again.

Returning to Troy for my grandmother's funeral had rekindled my love for this place. I realized that while the past can never be recreated, the memories and experiences that it holds remain etched deep within our hearts. As I drove away, I made a silent vow to visit more often, to reconnect with the people and places that made this town so special.

Perhaps one day, I will be fortunate enough to return to Troy for good. To walk its streets again, to revisit the places that hold so many memories. For now, though, I am content knowing that Troy will always have a special place in my heart, a place that I can call home, no matter where life takes me.",1,0.0
"John O'Neill, a prominent figure in sociology, phenomenology, and social theory, made significant contributions to these fields throughout his career. Born in 1940 in Chicago, Illinois, O'Neill developed a deep fascination with the complexities of human society from an early age. His quest to understand the underlying dynamics of social interactions led him to pursue a formal education in sociology.

O'Neill's academic journey began at the University of Chicago, where he completed his undergraduate degree in sociology. Immersed in the intellectually stimulating environment of one of the leading institutions in social sciences, O'Neill honed his critical thinking and analytical skills, setting the foundation for his future scholarly pursuits.

Following his undergraduate studies, O'Neill furthered his education by enrolling in a doctoral program in sociology at the University of California, Berkeley. It was during this time that he encountered the works of influential figures such as George Herbert Mead, Erving Goffman, and Alfred Schutz. These interactions with the sociological giants of the time profoundly impacted O'Neill's thinking and provided him with a solid theoretical framework.

O'Neill's research interests focused on understanding the social construction of reality, the nature of human agency, and the interplay between individual experiences and broader societal structures. Influenced by phenomenology, particularly the ideas of Edmund Husserl and Maurice Merleau-Ponty, O'Neill sought to unveil the intricate ways in which individuals make sense of their world and navigate through social interactions.

One of the central themes in O'Neill's work was the concept of intersubjectivity. He explored how individuals, through their mutual understanding and shared meanings, create and sustain social realities. O'Neill argued that social life is not a mere sum of individual actions, but rather a dynamic process shaped by intersubjective understandings and collective agreements.

O'Neill's groundbreaking book, ""The Communicative Body: Phenomenology and Social Theory,"" published in 1977, exemplified his theoretical contributions. In this work, he delved into the embodied nature of social interactions, emphasizing the significance of gestures, facial expressions, and bodily movements as essential elements in the construction of meaning. O'Neill's exploration of the communicative body challenged traditional sociological perspectives that focused primarily on language as the primary medium of communication.

Throughout his career, O'Neill also made significant contributions to the study of social identity and self-formation. He examined how individuals' identities are not only influenced by societal norms and expectations but are also shaped by their unique experiences and interpretations of the world. O'Neill argued that individuals actively participate in the construction and reconstruction of their identities, negotiating between societal pressures and personal desires.

O'Neill's work also encompassed critical examinations of power dynamics within societies. He explored how power operates both on a macro and micro level, shedding light on the subtle ways in which power relations shape social interactions. O'Neill highlighted the significance of everyday practices and rituals, such as greetings and politeness, in maintaining and reinforcing power structures.

Beyond his academic contributions, O'Neill was renowned for his commitment to teaching and mentoring students. He played a pivotal role in shaping the next generation of sociologists, inspiring them to think critically and challenge traditional sociological frameworks. Many of his students went on to become influential scholars in their own right, carrying forward O'Neill's legacy.

John O'Neill's work continues to have a lasting impact on sociology, phenomenology, and social theory. Through his emphasis on intersubjectivity, embodied communication, identity formation, and power dynamics, O'Neill expanded the boundaries of sociological inquiry. His interdisciplinary approach, drawing on phenomenological insights, provided a fresh perspective on how we understand and analyze social life. O'Neill's contributions will undoubtedly continue to shape the field for years to come, leaving a remarkable legacy in the study of human societies.",1,-1.0
"Space manufacturing is the production of tangible goods beyond Earth. Since most production capabilities are limited to low Earth orbit, the term in-orbit manufacturing is also frequently used. There are several rationales supporting in-space manufacturing: During the Soyuz 6 mission of 1969, Russian cosmonauts performed the first welding experiments in space. Three different welding processes were tested using a hardware unit called Vulkan. The tests included welding aluminum, titanium, and stainless steel. The Skylab mission, launched in May 1973, served as a laboratory to perform various space manufacturing experiments. The station was equipped with a materials processing facility that included a multi-purpose electric furnace, a crystal growth chamber, and an electron beam gun. Among the experiments to be performed was research on molten metal processing; photographing the behavior of ignited materials in zero-gravity; crystal growth; processing of immiscible alloys; brazing of stainless steel tubes, electron beam welding, and the formation of spheres from molten metal. The crew spent a total of 32 man-hours on materials science and space manufacturing investigation during the mission. The Space Studies Institute began hosting a bi-annual Space Manufacturing Conference in 1977[citation needed]. Microgravity research in materials processing continued in 1983 using the Spacelab facility. This module has been carried into orbit 26 times aboard the Space Shuttle, as of 2002[update]. In this role the shuttle served as an interim, short-duration research platform before the completion of the International Space Station. In February 1994 and September 1995, the Wake Shield Facility was carried into orbit by the Space Shuttle. This demonstration platform used the vacuum created in the orbital wake to manufacture thin films of gallium arsenide and aluminum gallium arsenide. On May 31, 2005, the recoverable, uncrewed Foton-M2 laboratory was launched into orbit. Among the experiments were crystal growth and the behavior of molten-metal in weightlessness. The completion of the International Space Station has provided expanded and improved facilities for performing industrial research. These have and will continue to lead to improvements in our knowledge of materials sciences, new manufacturing techniques on Earth, and potentially some important discoveries in space manufacturing methods. NASA and Tethers Unlimited will test the Refabricator aboard the ISS, which is intended to recycle plastic for use in space additive manufacturing.[3] The Material Science Laboratory Electromagnetic Levitator (MSL-EML) on board the Columbus Laboratory is a science facility that can be used to study the melting and solidification properties of various materials. The Fluid Science Laboratory (FSL) is used to study the behavior of liquids in microgravity.[4] There are several unique differences between the properties of materials in space compared to the same materials on the Earth. These differences can be exploited to produce unique or improved manufacturing techniques. For most manufacturing applications, specific material requirements must be satisfied. Mineral ores need to be refined to extract specific metals, and volatile organic compounds will need to be purified. Ideally these raw materials are delivered to the processing site in an economical manner, where time to arrival, propulsion energy expenditure, and extraction costs are factored into the planning process. Minerals can be obtained from asteroids, the lunar surface, or a planetary body. Volatiles could potentially be obtained from a comet, carbonaceous chondrite or ""C-Type"" asteroids, or the moons of Mars or other planets. It may also prove possible to extract hydrogen in the form of water ice or hydrated minerals from cold traps on the poles of the Moon. Unless the materials processing and the manufacturing sites are co-located with the resource extraction facilities, the raw materials would need to be moved about the Solar System. There are several proposed means of providing propulsion for this material, including solar sails, electric sails, magnetic sails, electric ion thrusters, microwave electrothermal thrusters, or mass drivers (this last method uses a sequence of electromagnets mounted in a line to accelerate a conducting material). At the materials processing facility, the incoming materials will need to be captured by some means. Maneuvering rockets attached to the load can park the content in a matching orbit. Alternatively, if the load is moving at a low delta-v relative to the destination, then it can be captured by means of a mass catcher. This could consist of a large, flexible net or inflatable structure that would transfer the momentum of the mass to the larger facility. Once in place, the materials can be moved into place by mechanical means or by means of small thrusters. Materials can be used for manufacturing either in their raw form, or by processing them to extract the constituent elements. Processing techniques include various chemical, thermal, electrolytic, and magnetic methods for separation. In the near term, relatively straightforward methods can be used to extract aluminum, iron, oxygen, and silicon from lunar and asteroidal sources. Less concentrated elements will likely require more advanced processing facilities, which may have to wait until a space manufacturing infrastructure is fully developed. Some of the chemical processes will require a source of hydrogen for the production of water and acid mixtures. Hydrogen gas can also be used to extract oxygen from the lunar regolith, although the process is not very efficient.[clarification needed][citation needed] So a readily available source of useful volatiles is a positive factor in the development of space manufacturing. Alternatively, oxygen can be liberated from the lunar regolith without reusing any imported materials by heating the regolith to 4,530 °F (2,500 °C) in a vacuum. This was tested on Earth with lunar simulant in a vacuum chamber. As much as 20% of the sample was released as free oxygen. Eric Cardiff calls the remainder slag. This process is highly efficient in terms of imported materials used up per batch, but is not the most efficient process in energy per kilogram of oxygen.[5] One proposed method of purifying asteroid materials is through the use of carbon monoxide (CO). Heating the material to 500 °F (260 °C) and exposing it to CO causes the metals to form gaseous carbonyls. This vapor can then be distilled to separate out the metal components,",0,0.0

"I am not a gambler. Never have been. That's because I don't have an addictive personality; obsessive-compulsive, maybe, but not addictive. Nothing that I've ever run across -- at least, so far-- has been so much of a good time that I'd abandon everything else to get it. My father-in-law from my first marriage once took me to Las Vegas and gave me $20 in quarters to run through the slot machines. An hour later, he came back and asked me how much money I had; I said confidently, ""Twenty dollars."" ""Ah, that's great,"" he said jovially. ""You broke even."" Nope, I said, and showed him the coin rolls still sitting in my pocket; ""I never broke it in the first place."" He was much disturbed by this display of reserve and encouraged me to blow it. ""It's free and clear,"" he said. ""I gave it to you; you're not losing anything really."" ""I know,"" I said, ""And I thank you for the gift; but you're right---as long as I keep it in my pocket, it won't get lost."" Apparently, I am an oddity in this direction. And you no longer have to go to the desert to place your bets. Even in West Virginia gambling has become an insidiously pervasive force to be reckoned with. The gas station just down the street has over a dozen different kinds of scratch-off tickets to consume your time and your money. And actually more of the latter than anything else, when you get right down to it. It's a seductive proposition: pay me a dollar, and maybe you'll get a hundred in return. It's the ultimate get-rich-quick scheme. And it works -- for the Lottery Commission, anyway. Personally, I'd rather not throw my hard-earned money on another man's game. However, just on a lark, I bought a Keno scratch-off ticket. It costs $2 and offers several different chances to win. It lists a column of numbers down the left side; and on the right side are several boxes of numbers covered up with grey gummy matter. You scratch off the boxes on the right to reveal sets of numbers that may, or may not, match the numbers on the left. Your cash reward depends on how many numbers you match up, and in what combinations. An experienced ticket-scratcher can rip through one Keno ticket in about 45 seconds. I've seen kids open Christmas presents slower. I know whereof I speak. Keep in mind that my mother is a seasoned scratch-off ticket junkie. She keeps a running tally in her head of where she's bought, which places are the luckiest, and which one is currently out of the Lucky Dogs or the Bingo tickets or whatever else happens to be the flavor of the month. The ticket buyers all know each other in an almost cultish way, reading the weekly paper for the most recent list of those who have made it big (or small) so they know who to snub in jealous-hearted disgust the next time they go out. If someone wins it big at the quickie mart, she won't go there for a few weeks because she says it's ""unlucky"", operating, I presume, on the premise that lightning never strikes twice. She rotates the establishments she frequents and looks down her nose with disdain at the ticket buyers who are so impatient to claim their loot that they scratch off the ticket right there on the counter at the store. This is not only a gross display of poor discipline, but it's rude. They are blocking her way to the cash register, thank you very much. Well, maybe it's catching. I thought maybe I should buy a scratch-off ticket on my own and see what everyone else was on about. The funny thing is, I won . It was weird, because I never win. The last thing I won was a cakewalk when I was in the 7th grade, and even then my brothers ate most the cake before I could. I won about $17 or so, so I sent my husband and my oldest son back to the grocery store (where I bought it) to have the ticket redeemed. On the way to the store, my son told my husband that he really felt I might have a problem. ""No,"" my husband said, ""She doesn't have a problem. She almost never does this."" My son said nothing, but observed as the winning ticket was exchanged for $15 and another Keno (hey, if I'm on a roll...). They brought the ticket back and I scratched it off. Unbelievable! I won again. This time, a smaller amount -- $5, or approximate. So I left the house to redeem the ticket again, and my oldest son stood up in the brave, solemn manner of a concerned friend about to do an intervention. ""I'm going with you,"" he said. I brought him along to the gas station ( I felt like ringing the changes a little bit). I walked in, put my ticket on the counter and told the 16-year-old cashier that I wanted to redeem the ticket and get another one for $2 with the winnings. ""My mother has a gambling problem,"" my son blurted out. Heads swiveled. ""No, I don't,"" I said, smiling calmly. ""I just want another ticket and the $3, please."" ""You see,"" my firstborn said traitorously. ""Denial. It's the first sign."" ""I really don't have any idea what you're talking about,"" I said. "" Grandma gambles. Lots of people we know gamble. I don't gamble."" ""You keep trading in the tickets,"" he said stubbornly. ""I keep winning ,"" I argued. The cashier cleared her throat and smiled at me almost patronizingly. ""Sometimes,"" she said, leaning forward in I'm sure what she thought was a helpful manner, ""Our children can see things in us that we can't see in ourselves."" ""Oh, surely, "" I snapped. ""That's certainly why I had mine."" That was the end of my scratch-off ticket expenditures.",0,0.0
"As I sit here, contemplating the state of my health and the sorry state of our environment, a wave of emotions washes over me. Fear, frustration, and a deep sense of urgency all blend together, creating a palpable sense of anxiety that I can't seem to shake off. It's moments like these when the gravity of the situation truly hits home, and I am left grappling with the reality of our fragile existence.

Health concerns have plagued me for some time now. From the persistent cough that refuses to leave my lungs to the unexplained fatigue that drains me day after day, I find myself caught in a seemingly never-ending cycle of doctor visits and tests. Each appointment brings with it a new batch of fears, a fresh wave of anxiety that threatens to swallow me whole.

The fear of cancer looms over me like a dark cloud, constantly reminding me of the fragility of life. It's a fear that nobody can truly comprehend until they experience it for themselves. The uncertainty, the constant nagging worry that every symptom could be a sign of something far more sinister, it eats away at your sanity.

But perhaps what scares me more than the potential threat to my own health is the sorry state of our environment. Living in New Jersey, I have been witness to the catastrophic consequences of human negligence and irresponsibility. The once-bustling industrial towns in my state have now become toxic wastelands, ravaged by years of pollution and disregard for the consequences of our actions.

It's heartbreaking to see the beautiful landscapes that were once the pride of our state now reduced to nothing more than dumping grounds for toxic waste. The rivers and lakes that were once teeming with life are now devoid of any signs of vitality, their waters poisoned by chemicals that have seeped into the earth and infiltrated every aspect of our lives.

To me, the connection between health concerns and environmental issues is undeniable. The toxic pollutants that contaminate our air, water, and soil have a direct impact on our well-being. It's no wonder that rates of cancer and other illnesses are on the rise. We are slowly poisoning ourselves, and if we don't take action now, the consequences will be catastrophic.

The frustrating part is that we have the knowledge and the technology to address these issues, but the powers that be seem more interested in profit margins than in the health and well-being of their citizens. It's disheartening to see politicians make empty promises, paying lip service to environmental cleanup while continuing to bow down to corporate interests.

But I refuse to let frustration consume me. I refuse to sit back and watch as our environment deteriorates further and our health continues to deteriorate alongside it. It's time for change, and it starts with each one of us taking responsibility for our actions.

I invite you, dear reader, to join me in advocating for environmental cleanup and healthcare reform. Together, we can push for stricter regulations on pollution and demand that corporations be held accountable for their actions. We can support organizations that work tirelessly to protect our environment and ensure access to affordable healthcare for all.

Let us not be silenced by fear or paralyzed by frustration. Let us channel our emotions into action, into a movement that will bring about the change we so desperately need. We owe it to ourselves, our children, and future generations to leave behind a healthier, more sustainable world. The time for complacency is over; now is the time for action.",1,0.0
"Chapter 1: The Discovery

Professor Carver gazed out of the window of the spaceship, his eyes fixated on the swirling vortex of colors that lay before him. This was no ordinary mission. The team of scientists, led by Carver himself, were about to embark on a groundbreaking expedition to a primitive alien planet. The planet, recently discovered by a deep space telescope, showed signs of potential for groundbreaking scientific discoveries.

Fred, the team's geologist, stood beside Carver. He eagerly tapped his foot, his eyes filled with excitement. ""Imagine what we could find on this planet, Professor! It could hold the key to unraveling the mysteries of the universe!""

Carver sighed, his brows furrowed. While he shared Fred's enthusiasm for scientific breakthroughs, he also believed in the importance of sticking to their original research goals. ""Fred, I understand your excitement, but we must remember that our primary objective is to study the planet's geological formations. We cannot let our excitement cloud our judgement.""

Chapter 2: The Exploration

As the team descended onto the alien planet, they were greeted by an astonishing landscape. Towering mountains, lush green forests, and crystalline lakes stretched out as far as the eye could see. The air was filled with an otherworldly scent, a mix of unfamiliar flora and minerals.

The team split into smaller groups, each assigned with different tasks. Professor Carver led the group focused on the planet's geological formations, while Fred joined a team investigating the planet's water sources. It didn't take long before the team encountered their first obstacle.

Chapter 3: The Mysterious Phenomenon

One evening, as Professor Carver was analyzing a rock formation, he noticed a shimmering light in the distance. Curiosity piqued, he called Fred over to investigate. The two scientists cautiously approached the source of the light, their hearts pounding with anticipation.

To their surprise, they stumbled upon a large, translucent dome. Inside, they found a fascinating phenomenon - a microscopic organism emitting a pulsating light. Carver's eyes widened, realizing the significance of their discovery. This tiny creature could hold the key to understanding the alien planet's ecosystem.

However, as they raced back to inform the rest of the team, they were met with resistance. Some scientists argued that investigating this phenomenon would deviate from their original research goals. Others worried about the potential consequences of meddling with an unknown organism.

Chapter 4: The Divide

Back at the camp, tensions rose among the team. Professor Carver passionately argued for further investigation, believing that understanding the organism was vital to their scientific mission. Fred, too, supported Carver, eager to explore the unknown and push the limits of their knowledge.

On the other hand, some scientists were adamantly against pursuing the phenomenon. They feared the unintended consequences and worried that their main objectives would be compromised. The camp was divided, each side presenting valid points, making it difficult to come to a consensus.

Chapter 5: The Decision

Days turned into weeks, and the team struggled to find common ground. Professor Carver and Fred continued to advocate for further investigation, believing it was their duty as scientists to understand this alien life form. They couldn't let this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity slip away.

Eventually, after much deliberation and heated discussions, a compromise was reached. The team agreed to dedicate a small portion of their time and resources to studying the mysterious organism while ensuring their primary research goals were not abandoned.

Chapter 6: The Discovery Continues

With the decision made, the team resumed their explorations, now with a renewed sense of unity. As they delved deeper into their research, they made astonishing discoveries. They found that the alien organism possessed unique bio-luminescent properties, and their study shed light on the planet's fragile ecosystem.

The humble microbe turned out to be a keystone species, playing a crucial role in the planet's delicate balance. This revelation had profound implications for the team's understanding of alien life and opened up new avenues for scientific research.

As the expedition came to an end, Professor Carver and Fred stood side by side, reflecting on their journey and the impact it would have on future scientific endeavors. They realized that sometimes, it was important to follow one's curiosity, even if it meant deviating from the original plan.

Carver turned to Fred and smiled. ""We may have had our disagreements, but in the end, it was our shared passion for discovery that brought us together.""

Fred nodded, his eyes filled with gratitude. ""Indeed, Professor. This expedition has been a remarkable journey, one that has expanded our knowledge and challenged our preconceived notions.""

And with that, the team bid farewell to the alien planet, their minds buzzing with excitement for the scientific breakthroughs that awaited them back on Earth. The primitive alien planet had offered them much more than they could have ever imagined, and they were determined to share their discoveries with the world.",1,-1.0
"Charles Francis Colcord was a prominent figure in the Old West, known for his diverse accomplishments as a cattle rancher, U.S. Marshal, Chief of Police, businessman, and pioneer. Born on May 30, 1859, in Lee, Massachusetts, Colcord had a childhood marked by hard work and a passion for the outdoors.

Growing up in a family of modest means, Colcord learned the value of perseverance and determination from a young age. His father, Charles Augustus Colcord, worked as a general storekeeper and instilled in his son a strong work ethic. As a teenager, Colcord found himself drawn to the allure of the Wild West and its untamed landscapes. Eager to explore new horizons, he left Massachusetts and ventured westward, eventually settling in Texas.

Colcord's entry into the cattle industry proved to be a turning point in his life. From an early age, he was captivated by the vast open plains, and he saw an opportunity to make his mark in the cattle business. With his entrepreneurial spirit, Colcord acquired vast tracts of land in Texas and built a thriving cattle ranch. His success in the industry earned him a reputation as a skilled rancher and cattleman.

However, Colcord's life took another twist when he was appointed as a U.S. Marshal in 1889. This role afforded him the opportunity to work closely with legendary lawmen, such as Bass Reeves and Bill Tilghman. As a U.S. Marshal, Colcord played a crucial role in maintaining law and order in the Wild West. He often found himself on the front lines, confronting outlaws and ensuring the safety of settlers in the region.

Despite his success as a U.S. Marshal, Colcord's ambitions extended beyond law enforcement. In 1898, he took on the role of Chief of Police in Oklahoma City, a position that allowed him to contribute to the development of the growing city. Colcord's leadership and vision helped mold Oklahoma City into a thriving urban center, and his efforts to establish a modern police force left a lasting impact on the community.

Colcord's entrepreneurial pursuits continued to flourish, and he diversified his business interests throughout his life. He ventured into various industries, including banking and real estate, and played a crucial role in the development of Oklahoma City's business district. His financial acumen and keen eye for opportunities ensured his success in these ventures, further cementing his status as a prominent businessman in the region.

Throughout his life, Colcord witnessed significant historical events and encountered notable figures of the Old West. From the rugged landscapes of the open prairies to the bustling streets of Oklahoma City, he was a witness to the rapid transformation of the American frontier. His life intersected with iconic figures such as Buffalo Bill Cody and Wild Bill Hickok, further adding to the rich tapestry of his experiences.

Charles Francis Colcord's legacy as a cattle rancher, U.S. Marshal, Chief of Police, businessman, and pioneer of the Old West lives on.

"be of practical assistance to the novice in short story writing, from the moment the tale is dimly conceived until it is completed and ready for the editor's judgment. The rules and principles here presented embody not what I conceive to be right, but what the great masters of the short story have thought to be right, and what they have proved to be at least successful. I speak only as a delver into the secrets of other men; and if I seem arrogant, it is due to the influence of the company I keep. My deductions are made not only from the artifices and triumphs of the successful, but from the struggles and failures of the unfortunate as well; and I have endeavored to make clear both the philosophy and the application of all the principles so deduced. Though in theory these rules are obligatory on all who essay the short story, they are frequently and knowingly evaded or violated by the masters of the art, whose genius is great enough to excuse their disregard of the conventions, or whose skill is sufficient to smooth over their technical lapses; but for the novice the only safe course is a careful observance of all conventions. To the aspiring writer this book may seem to be merely a catalogue of ""Don'ts"", the gist of which is, ""Don't write""; but that is to misread me. Short story writing is not easy, and I cannot make it so, even if I would; but it is far from my purpose to discourage any person who feels the Heaven-sent call to write, and who has the will and ability to respond to it. But that call is but a summons to labor--and to labor the severest and most persistent. To one who comes to it but half-heartedly, illy prepared, shirking its requirements, I can predict certain failure; but to the earnest, serious, conscientious worker, I would say a word of hope. The promotion from the rank of amateur to the dignity of authorship may be long in coming, but it will come at last. Fame, like all else that this world has to give, depends largely upon downright hard work; and he who has the courage to strive in the face of disappointments will achieve success in the end. Throughout this book I have endeavored to give my statements definiteness by the employment of numerous examples, both good and bad. I have made no attempt to present an exhaustive analysis of the technique of individuals or of schools, but have chosen my illustrations with a single view to their aptness; I have, however, for the convenience of reference, taken these paradigms chiefly from the published collections of stories by the older and better known writers. My ""awful examples"" are verbatim excerpts from manuscripts which have passed through my hands; their authorship is concealed for obvious reasons. To the best of my knowledge there is no book extant which treats solely of the technique of the short story. The nearest approach to it is ""How to Write Fiction,"" an anonymous work published by Bellaires & Co., London; but to my mind that is too slight, too theoretical, and too enamored of the artificial French school to be of practical value to the amateur. Far better, as working guides, are the frequent fragmentary articles on the short story, many of them by successful short story writers, published in current periodicals, to which I am considerably indebted. But my greatest obligation is to a course in ""The Art of the Short Story""--the first university course ever offered in that subject--conducted at the University of Chicago in 1896 by Dr. E. H. Lewis. C. R. B. CHICAGO, August 1, 1900. INTRODUCTION The short story was first recognized as a distinct class of literature in 1842, when Poe's criticism of Hawthorne[1] called attention to the new form of fiction. Short story writing had, however, been practiced for many years before that: perhaps the narratives of Homer and the tales of the first books of the Bible may be considered as the first examples; certainly the short story is closely associated in its early history with narrative poems, allegorical tales, and mouth-to-mouth traditions, and it can be traced surely to the _fabliaux_ of the thirteenth century. Later writers aided in its development: Mallory's ""Morte D'Arthur"" and Caxton's popularization of old romances marked a further progress; and some of the work of Defoe and Addison would almost stand the modern tests. But the short story as we know it to-day is a product of the nineteenth century; and it owes its position in literature, if not its very existence, to the work of Irving, Hawthorne, and Poe. They first recognized its possibilities and employed it seriously; and the art and genius which they put into their tales assured the short story a permanent place in literature. They differed in subject matter and style, but they recognized the same requirements and limitations; and the canons which they established then obtain to-day. The modern short story is essentially an American product; and our masters of its art have established precedents for literary workers of the old world. In England, Stevenson, Kipling and Haggard are considered the originators of the modern short story; and Zola, de Maupassant, Daudet and Paul Marguerite in France, Tolstoi in Russia, and other famous foreign authors have their claims for consideration; but all of them, admittedly or not, are but disciples of the earlier American trinity. This book will confine itself to the English-American short story. To-day the short story is so popular that we seem to be in a new literary epoch--the epoch of the short story--and there is no apparent cause to expect an early diminution in the demand for such literature; so that to the young writer the short story offers the best opportunity to prove his mettle. Then, too, it has the additional value of being an excellent school for the novelist. The short story and",0,0.0
"Title: The Impact of Late 18th-Century Novels: A Comparative Analysis of ""Rasselas,"" ""The Castle of Otranto,"" and ""Vathek""

Introduction:
The late 18th century witnessed a surge of literary creativity, with notable works emerging from various genres. Three novels that emerged during this period, ""Rasselas"" by Samuel Johnson, ""The Castle of Otranto"" by Horace Walpole, and ""Vathek"" by William Beckford, played pivotal roles in shaping the literary landscape of the time. This article aims to provide an analytical and informative perspective, exploring the significance and impact of these three novels within their historical context.

Historical Context:
The late 18th century was marked by the Enlightenment, a period that emphasized reason, rationality, and the pursuit of knowledge. These novels reflect the changes and tensions brought about by this intellectual movement. ""Rasselas"" (1759), for example, explores the search for happiness and the futility of worldly pursuits. ""The Castle of Otranto"" (1764) is considered the first Gothic novel, drawing on medieval settings and supernatural elements. Finally, ""Vathek"" (1786) takes inspiration from the Orient, embodying the fascination with the exotic during this time.

Writing Style and Themes:
Each of these novels employs distinct writing styles and explores different themes. ""Rasselas,"" written in prose, reflects Johnson's moralizing tendencies. It follows the journey of the eponymous protagonist, who, in his quest for the meaning of life, encounters various philosophical and moral dilemmas. The novel examines themes such as the nature of happiness, the illusion of power, and the constraints imposed on individuals by society.

In contrast, Walpole's ""The Castle of Otranto"" is characterized by its Gothic writing style, employing supernatural occurrences and mysterious settings. The novel centers around a cursed nobleman and his desperate attempts to secure his lineage. Themes of fate, ambition, and the supernatural pervade the narrative, contributing to the emergence of a new genre that would greatly influence subsequent literature.

""Vathek,"" written by Beckford, stands out due to its Eastern-inspired setting and atmospheric prose. The novel tells the story of an Eastern caliph's descent into decadence and depravity. Beckford's vivid descriptions of opulence and hedonism captivate readers, while themes of ambition, power, and the consequences of unchecked desires create a moral undertone. The writing style reflects the fascination with the exotic that permeated European society during this period.

Comparisons to Other Works and Authors:
These three novels not only contributed to the literary landscape of the late 18th century but also influenced subsequent literary works. ""Rasselas,"" for instance, has been linked to Voltaire's ""Candide"" due to their shared disillusionment with the pursuit of happiness. Both novels expose the flaws and emptiness inherent in the human search for contentment.

""The Castle of Otranto"" set the stage for the development of the Gothic genre. Its combination of supernatural elements, suspenseful plotlines, and dark atmospheres became a blueprint for future Gothic writers such as Ann Radcliffe, Matthew Lewis, and Mary Shelley. The novel played a crucial role in the popularity of Gothic literature during the Romantic Period.

""Vathek,"" with its exotic setting and sensual descriptions, paved the way for Orientalism in literature, influencing subsequent writers such as Byron and Shelley. Its exploration of the dark side of human desires and the consequences of unchecked ambition resonated with readers and became a precursor to the theme of moral degradation in later works.

Conclusion:
The late 18th century novels, ""Rasselas,"" ""The Castle of Otranto,"" and ""Vathek,"" significantly impacted the literary scene of their time. They reflect the intellectual and cultural changes of the Enlightenment era while exploring a range of themes such as happiness, fate, ambition, and morality. The distinct writing styles employed in each novel, from Johnson's moralizing prose to Walpole's Gothic elements to Beckford's atmospheric descriptions, contributed to the development of various literary genres and influenced future works by other authors. Understanding the historical context and significance of these novels allows readers to appreciate the lasting legacy they left within the literary landscape of the late 18th century and beyond.",1,0.0
"""FZZT"" is the sixth episode of the first season of the American television series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Based on the Marvel Comics organization S.H.I.E.L.D., it follows Phil Coulson and his team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents as they investigate a series of deaths caused by an alien virus. It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and acknowledges the franchise's films. The episode was written by Paul Zbyszewski, and directed by Vincent Misiano. Clark Gregg reprises his role as Coulson from the film series, and is joined by series regulars Ming-Na Wen, Brett Dalton, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, and Elizabeth Henstridge. The episode draws comparisons to the plight of first responders to the September 11 attacks by showing firefighters (with guest star Vincent Laresca playing one) dying as a consequence of responding to the Battle of New York, as seen in Marvel's The Avengers. The episode also features a major skydiving sequence, realized by combining live footage with CGI, as part of the development of the characters Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons, who received their own musical theme for the episode. It also sees Titus Welliver reprise his role from the Marvel One-Shot Item 47 as S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Felix Blake. ""FZZT"" originally aired on ABC on November 5, 2013, and according to Nielsen Media Research, was watched by 10.93 million viewers within a week of its release. The episode received a positive critical response, with the character development praised, especially that of the characters Fitz and Simmons. In Pennsylvania, a Boy Scout leader is killed in an apparent freak lightning incident after investigating a mysterious humming sound. His body is found floating above the ground, warranting the intervention of Agent Phil Coulson and his team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. Agents Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons are unable to determine the cause of death. Satellites pick up another lightning event not far from the first, and Coulson, with Agents Melinda May and Grant Ward, arrives at the source to find a second body, floating like the first. Civilian hacker and S.H.I.E.L.D. trainee Skye discovers that the two victims were both volunteer firefighters from the same station who responded to the Battle of New York. At the firehouse they discover a third firefighter, Tony Diaz, who can hear a strange humming sound. Satellites pick up a third electrical event at the firehouse, as May discovers a Chitauri helmet in Diaz's possession—a souvenir from the Battle of New York. Diaz and the other victims had been cleaning ""rust"" from the helmet several nights earlier, and Simmons deduces that they were all infected with an alien virus. Coulson helps Diaz come to terms with his situation, before leaving him to die. Aboard the Bus (the plane that serves as the agents' mobile base) the team are transporting the helmet to the Sandbox, a S.H.I.E.L.D. research facility located in Africa, when Coulson realizes that Simmons has been infected as well. She gives herself only 2 hours to live, but the plane is above the Atlantic Ocean and at least 3 hours from land. Agent Felix Blake at S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters orders Coulson to dump her off the plane rather than risk the safety of the rest of the team, but Coulson refuses. Rather than let the rest of the team die, Simmons jumps out of the plane herself; moments later, Fitz discovers an antidote for the virus. Ward jumps after her with a parachute and the cure, saving her life. In an end tag, Blake confronts Coulson about his insubordination, warning him that he could lose his team if he is not careful. In October 2013, Marvel revealed that the sixth episode would be titled ""FZZT"", and would be written by Paul Zbyszewski, with Vincent Misiano directing.[1] Zbyszewski credited fellow writers Lauren LeFranc and Rafe Judkins for ""a lot of the fun"" in the episode.[2]: 31:13 Zbyszewski said the audition scene between Elizabeth Henstridge and Iain De Caestecker served as the ""genesis"" for the events of ""FZZT"", with a similar storyline conceived by the creators as part of the initial scripts ordered by ABC.[2]: 2:58-3:30 He also felt the story told in the episode was one that usually ""isn't possible at the beginning"" of a series, as it ""must be earned"",[3]: 82 explaining the goal was to have the audience ""feel for"" Jemma Simmons and Leo Fitz. ""FZZT"" was also the first episode where the series began to move away from the procedural ""case of the week"" into more serialized storylines.[2]: 17:45-18:50 Main cast members Clark Gregg, Ming-Na Wen, Brett Dalton, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, and Elizabeth Henstridge star as Phil Coulson, Melinda May, Grant Ward, Skye, Leo Fitz, and Jemma Simmons, respectively. Titus Welliver reprises his role of Agent Felix Blake from the Marvel One-Shot Item 47 (2012), while Vincent Laresca also guest stars as Tony Diaz.[1] The Chitauri helmet featured in the episode was created by props master Scott Bauer. Bauer had originally looked in Marvel's archives for one from The Avengers (2012), but learned the film had only featured CGI helmets,[3]: 83 requiring him to request the rights to the design from Marvel Studios to fabricate the helmet.[2]: 53:47 Because of time constraints, only one helmet was able to be made for filming the episode.[3]: 83 Filming occurred from September 12 to 19, 2013.[3]: 81 Mark Kolpack, visual effects supervisor for the series, explained that multiple techniques were used to create the effects for the climactic skydiving sequence in the episode. Henstridge and Dalton were filmed in front of a green screen on wires and/or a turntable, with the sky, clouds, and ocean added with computer-generated imagery. The two actors were also digitally scanned to produce digital stunt doubles for use in ""larger scope shots that were not possible with the real actors."" For these shots, skydiver Hannah Betts and stuntman Greg Rementer performed on the Sony Motion Capture Stage, with the movements captured through performance-capture technology and used to drive the digital double performances.[4] For the scene where Coulson talks to the",0,0.0
"Christopher Patrick Gibson's biography is marked by a distinguished military career and a successful foray into the political arena. Born on May 13, 1964, Gibson hails from a humble background in upstate New York. Growing up in Kinderhook, a small town in Columbia County, he was raised in a working-class family.

Gibson's academic journey began at Ichabod Crane High School, where he excelled both academically and athletically. After graduating, he pursued higher education at Siena College, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in History. Following the completion of his undergraduate studies, Gibson attended Cornell University, where he earned a Master of Public Administration and a Ph.D. in Government.

Gibson's military career began when he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Army in 1986. Over the course of his twenty-four years of service, he held various command and staff positions, including serving as a platoon leader, company commander, and battalion commander, among others. His military decorations include the Legion of Merit, four Bronze Star Medals, the Purple Heart, and the Combat Infantryman Badge.

Gibson's commitment to serving his country extended beyond his military service. After retiring from the Army with the rank of colonel in 2010, he decided to enter the political arena. He joined the Republican Party and announced his candidacy for the United States Congress in New York's 20th Congressional District.

One of the defining characteristics of Gibson's political career is his stance on term limits. He pledged to serve only four terms in Congress, emphasizing the need for fresh faces and ideas in Washington. This commitment resonated with voters, and in 2010, he emerged victorious in a closely contested race against the incumbent. He was subsequently reelected in 2012 and 2014.

During his time in Congress, Gibson focused on a range of issues, including national security, economic growth, and environmental conservation. As a former military officer, he brought a unique perspective to national security discussions, advocating for a strong defense while promoting a prudent use of resources. Gibson also emphasized the need for bipartisan cooperation, often working across party lines to find common ground and advance legislation.

In addition to his work in Congress, Gibson authored a book titled ""Rally Point: Five Tasks to Unite the Country and Revitalize the American Dream."" In this book, he offers his insights into the challenges facing the country and proposes a path forward to foster unity and prosperity.

Gibson's decision to retire from Congress after four terms was met with mixed reactions. Some praised his commitment to term limits and his willingness to uphold his promises, while others expressed disappointment at losing an experienced legislator. Nevertheless, Gibson's political career left a lasting impact on the community he represented, and his dedication to public service earned him respect across party lines.

Following his retirement from Congress in 2017, Gibson became a visiting lecturer of leadership studies at Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts. He also serves as the president of Siena College, his alma mater, further contributing to the education and development of future leaders.

In conclusion, Christopher Patrick Gibson's biography reflects a life dedicated to service and leadership. His military service, academic achievements, and successful political career exemplify his commitment to making a positive impact on his community and country. From his humble beginnings in upstate New York to his retirement from Congress, Gibson's journey is a testament to the power of determination and a steadfast belief in the ideals of public service.",1,0.0
"A while back a young friend on a message board was asking us older wiser heads for advice about his love life. I admit I got a bit carried away, but perhaps someday I'll write a book and this can be a chapter: Hey Matt…. Honestly, I WOKE UP at 7:30 am thinking about your story. This is WAY longer than I intended it to be. I was thinking that I really can’t understand how YOU feel, in part because I am a woman, and in part because I never had experienced the apparent intensity that you feel toward this girl. THEN I realized I had felt like that once, but didn’t have the guts to tell that person how I felt. What I can share is a woman’s point of view. What we have here, to boil it down, is a young man, infatuated with a slightly older woman who prefers to think of him as just a friend, but he wants more than that; what you want to know is can you do anything to change that. Probably not much. At least there is nothing you can do to change her feelings overnight. One of the problems with the guys I dated who professed their “love” to me is that, when I said I felt only friendship for them, they weren’t interested enough to stick around and see if they could change that – except for two guys,Dave (not his real name)and Tim. I married Tim. Dave and I were good friends in high school and after. Then one day I received a letter from him in which he hinted around that maybe his feelings were becoming stronger than that. When he came back from his tour (he was part of a touring acting company), he professed his love and actually said he wanted to marry me. (we were in our twenties, but the basic idea still applies.) I explained that I loved him, but my feelings were of the “brotherly” love type. I said that if he wanted to try and change that, we could do stuff together and see what developed. All successful romantic relationships have a strong element of friendship, so that was a good sign. For two years we “dated”, andDave was great. He never made me feel pressured and we had a good time together. He even lost weight to be more physically attractive. There wasn’t anything he could have done differently or better. At the end of two years, he was preparing to go off to a university that was a long ways away. He took me out to a very nice restaurant. When we got back to my apartment, I gave him a big hug and said, “Dave, I love you, but I don’t think my feelings are ever going to become the marrying kind. You have to know this before you go off to Wisconsin, so you can feel free to find someone there.” He was sad. Two months later, he was engaged to someone he met at college. Now they are married and have four kids! AfterDave I dated a few guys who pushed for the physical aspect of the relationship before I had a chance to get to know them. When I wasn’t ready to “make out” on the second or third date, they took it as rejection and “dumped” me. Then Tim came along. We dated and when he brought me home, he gave me a little peck on the cheek and said good night and that was it every Saturday night for the first two months! He gave our relationship time to develop and solidify. By the time he was ready to give me those longer, slower type kisses, I didn’t feel as if I were kissing a stranger. Every date was like another piece of the puzzle that we fit carefully into place to see what the picture would be. He built our relationship slowly, patiently, and, over time, I grew to trust him and realize that this was the kind of man to whom I could entrust my future happiness and my future children. About a year later, we married, and now we have been married for over eighteen years and - it is good! Our love, which started as a tender plant that blossomed and bore fruit, has turned into an oak tree with deep roots and strong limbs that shelter our children and don’t shake with every blast of wind that comes along. But, I wax poetic. Teaching literature makes you subject to sappy metaphors. (get it? sappy? a tree? haha.) Here Matt interjects, “Hey Piper, will you knock off the crap and get on with the lecture?” Certainly. To win ABC, follow steps A,B, and C. Step A: Accept that you and she are friends and be content with that relationship for now. Don’t put any pressure on her; just be your charming self. If it is meant to be, it will happen without you forcing it. Actually, it’s a good thing that she is reacting to your admission of love like she does. If she was ready to rush into a girlfriend/boyfriend relationship with someone she knows only superficially, I would suspect she’s one of those needy girls looking for a man to lean on. They can be clingy and whiney and that gets old real fast! Her independence and clear-thinking indicates a person who is emotionally healthy, and that’s probably one of the things that you find attractive about her. Step B: Don’t YOU be the needy/clingy/demanding one. Be someone who is attractive because you are relaxing and fun to be with. Girls like intelligence, self-confidence, and tender, protective strength. Build the relationship slowly and patiently. Show that you think of her and are considerate of her feelings and respectful of her opinions. Step C: If you want a Queen, you have to make yourself into a King.

"I am always incredibly amazed at how fast wonderful days skim by, and last week was no exception. In fact, the only slow part of last week was the Friday, Saturday, and Sunday before we all headed down to sunny Florida. Steven and I amused ourselves with repeated trips to Wal-Mart. I believe we set a new personal record for ourselves: four trips in three days. Quite scary, not to mention tortureous . . . except for the last trip when we went with our friends and I got a kooky straw hat. The seven of us stayed at a wonderful beachhouse courtesy of Ande Like the Mint and her parents. I was extremely amused as I have always stayed at a condo for previous beachy trips. I'm afraid I'm ruined for life and will stay at beachhouses forevermore. This house was especially cool as there was an elevator installed. We mostly used it as an oversized dumb waiter for all our luggage. Below is Steven preparing to safeguard our loot for the long vertical trek. _______________________________ The house was across the street from the beach side (with the house itself located on the 'bay side'), but the walk to the beach wasn't bad at all as long as you were wearing shoes. I know this from experience. My feet took quite a beating on this trip, starting with my lack to lather the tops of my feet with suntan lotion. It was an interesting experience to walk around after that. Another morning, in my rush to get a picture of the sunrise, I walked out to the beach barefooted. The driveway to the house is defined by semi-crushed oyster shells, mind you. Walking back over that with ice-cold feet is a bit piercing. There also was an encounter with a rouge sand spur, of which I think there is still a little bit in my heel. Now I bet I could walk over hot coals or a bed of nails and not even flinch. Yeah. I'm afraid to say that we all committed the terrible crime of trespassing while we were down there. The guy who has a house on beach side apparently does not want indentations of footprints to mar his sandy drive. We bit our thumb at him (who was out of town anyway) and walked on through. Eat our footprints. ______________________________ All the previous times I've vacationed at the beach, I did so with my immediate family. On this go I was quite amused by all the activities we did. Frisbees, flying kites, skimboarding, chasing after dolphins, all this was fascinating. All the pictures I took attest to this. If somebody moved, I snapped their picture. I was a triggerhappy Carrie with a new digital camera. I was probably the most annoying person on the trip in that respect, but I just couldn't help myself. It was a great liberty to take picture after picture with no worries of film and development costs; knowing I could just run inside and scoot the picture over to the (rented) laptop and start anew. To be able to immediately look over my work to delete unfocused shots, check for under or overexposure, or just laugh until my sides hurt at the endearing goofiness of everyone . . . it's just perfect. Ohhhh, the humor of it all. And now to end this section with a totally inadequate picture of a game of frisbee. __________________________________ On the coldest day of the week (Wednesday) we all went into town to eat lunch and play putt-putt golf. I do enjoy the putt-putt, even though I suck horribly at it. I mostly amused myself by taking pictures of others. Here is Ande Like the Mint kicking ass with her kiddie putter. __________________________________ We went on quite a few beachwalks while we were down there. That was very refreshing; Lord knows I need the exercise. During these walks, I was surprised at all of the naturalness that was still around on the island. There were always at least a few dolphins just beyond the sand bar; there were sandpipers, seagulls (Mine?), and pelicans in land, sea, and air; and my Lord, there were so many seashells. A former marine biologist major's heaven. I even saw a dead sea cucumber washed up on the beach. We found something new on every walk we embarked on. ______________________________________ I mentioned earlier that I went out to get sunrise pictures, forgetting my shoes in the process. Remember? Well of course I had to include at least one of my hard-earned sunrise pictures. I got quite a few, of course, but this one amuses me because of the unknown individual with his hands in his pockets in the foreground. It was fascinating how fast the sun came up over the water and before you knew it, it was daytime and you were out of disk space. Click, click, click. _______________________________________ I think that every trip needs that one specific moment that defines the entire experience. It is even better if this moment is captured in picture form. Even though not everyone that was there is in this picture, it still, I think, defines the whole week for everybody. It's a fantastic picture, but goddamn it, Ken snapped it with my camera, not me. _______________________________________ Skimboarding, though it looked amusing, was not something I was willing to try. I know I would have just fallen down and busted my ass on the hard, wet sand. So instead, I got pictures of other people doing exactly what I feared would happen. _______________________________________ To a continue a tradition from last year, we created another Mer-Willis, except this time it was more gender-correct with Katie as the sandy creature. We were all rushing to create the sculpture and snap pictures before her boobs cracked. _______________________________________ We laughed. We danced. We burned. We jumped for joy. _______________________________________ Proof I was there. Proof that not only did I wear a swimsuit, it was of the",0,0.0
"The theory of evolution could be the most powerful concept to come out of science. While the details are the subject of ongoing study, all of the remarkable features of living things are amenable to understanding through Darwin’s theory of natural selection, further extended by our modern understanding of genetics. Moreover, while the theory has been around for a long time, recently there seems to have been a deepening of appreciation for its significance in diverse areas. Psychologists and philosophers, for instance, are going back and rethinking their disciplines with an evolutionary mindset. This involves realizing that every human attribute needs to be informed by a view of how it may have emerged from natural selection. The strengths and weaknesses of humanity are shaped by how we evolved. I plan to pick up on this theme in a later post. The power of evolutionary thinking can be extended beyond the life sciences to encompass phenomena throughout the physical universe. While the term evolution is not always used, scientists have analyzed many non-biological processes that have characteristics similar to evolution. What is common to these is that they are complex dynamic systems that exhibit a self-organizing character. Examples of this include crystal growth and star formation. One of the interesting things about these systems is that a reductionist approach has a hard time describing the large-scale character of the system: somehow, the parts “know” what the whole is doing and fulfill their role accordingly. It seems that as the universe has increased in complexity through time, new kinds of orderly structures and processes have arisen from this complexity. It isn’t magic; it is just something that naturally occurs. So, here is a “big-picture” view of how evolution has proceeded in the universe. Starting from a set of conditions which prevailed a fraction of an instant after a “big bang”, the universe evolved in time to include a variety of complicated yet ordered systems, including galaxies and solar systems. Then conditions on earth fostered the evolution of the first living organisms within a billion years after its formation. After this, the somewhat more familiar story of the evolution of the variety of species unfolded. Taking evolution seriously in its broadest applications reminds us that our origin is grounded in the most basic level of the universe. Many of us have been exposed to the idea that we are made of “star stuff”. This means that the atoms within us (specifically those heavier than hydrogen and helium) were created through nuclear fusion in the interior of an early generation of stars. These stars ended their lives, often explosively, and the atoms dispersed and later formed into our solar system. Our bodies, of course, are created on earth from these same atoms. But you can even take this story further. The subatomic particles trace themselves back to that time shortly after the big bang. We have a common link to every part of the universe which was formed in that early crucible. The reason I’m going through this story is to help explain why I’m going to present a conclusion that at first glance may be hard to accept: consciousness is everywhere. Or, to soften it slightly: consciousness or at least its building blocks are ubiquitous in the universe. There are just two steps which lead to this conclusion. The first, which I discussed in my last post, is to realize that consciousness must be a fundamental feature of the natural universe. The second step is the insight that, as a part of the natural world, consciousness could not have suddenly appeared out of nowhere. All of the fundamental particles and forces (or whatever else makes up the universe) have been with us since the beginning. Consciousness exists “all the way down”. When this position is put forward in philosophical circles (often it is called panpsychism), it is controversial. Also, it is easy to make fun of or caricature: Am I saying that rocks can think? No, I’m not. Let me flesh out this picture a bit more and see if it seems more reasonable. Our human abilities are unique in the world. Even our closest animal cousins cannot think the way we can. They can’t use language. They may not have much in the way of long term memory, etc. Reflective self-consciousness is newer on the scene and seems to be confined to humans. When I say consciousness is everywhere, remember I am using my limited definition of consciousness, which means a basic subjective awareness. Of course, even using this limited definition, I admit I have trouble conceiving what it could really be like the further away from the human version I get. In the case of most animals, I think they have awareness in a sense we might relate to. One quality of our experience in particular most animals probably share is that they have feelings. Evolutionary scientists believe that emotions have an ancient lineage as internal markers of the instincts shaped by natural selection. Feelings and emotions are therefore more primordial than thinking and language. In the case of primitive animals, plants, and all the way down to single-celled organisms, I may be able to stretch my imagination and picture that while they do not have the sense organs or nervous systems to replicate experience of our sort, it still is like something for them to exist and interact with their environment. Going to the inorganic world, things get even harder. I think there is something about the way living things are put together which elevates their consciousness. However, I do think elementary constituents of the universe must have at least a “proto-consciousness” which allows the increasingly robust version to emerge at higher levels of organization. As an aside, the importance of how something is organized is why a rock has no more impressive consciousness than its parts. A rock is basically a pile of molecules. A one-celled organism powerfully leverages its parts to operate at a higher level of consciousness.",0,0.0
"urlLink Star Telegram | 10/30/2003 | Reality vs. public relations : This column by Ivins wasn't really notable, until I got to the following passage. She's railing about the PR effort of the Bush White House to counter the negative propoganda of the mainstream media. She said - ""George Nethercutt, a Republican congressman from Washington state, spent four days in Iraq and told an audience at home: 'The story of what we've done in Iraq is remarkable. It is a better and more important story than losing a couple of soldiers every day.'"" Sounds terrible, doesn't it? Heartless, cruel republican, dismissing the lives of soldiers so casually.... Unfortunately, Nethercutt had been DOWDified by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. If you aren't aware, DOWDification is what Maureen DOWD did to President Bush, when she strung together two different parts of a sentence, dropping out some crucial words to make it sound like Bush said something he didn't. She got away with it to, since the NYT reequired no correction even in the face of audio recordings of what Bush said. Back to Nethercutt. Here is what he said, as confirmed by an audio recording of his statement. ""It's a bigger and better and more important story than losing a couple of soldiers every day, which, which, heaven forbid, is awful."" Make a difference? I took this from Best of the Web on Wednesday. If you are interested in the whole sorry affair, I'll paste it in here. On Oct. 15, we approvingly noted http://www.opinionjournal.com/best/?id=110004168#nethercutt a comment from Rep. George Nethercutt, a Washington state Republican who is challenging Sen. Patty Murray in next year's election. ""The story of what we've done in the postwar period is remarkable,"" the Seattle Post-Intelligencer quoted Nethercutt, who had just returned from Iraq, as saying. ""It is a better and more important story than losing a couple of soldiers every day."" That day we received an e-mail from Mary Lane of the Nethercutt Senate campaign: *** QUOTE *** The Seattle P-I actually cut off the second part of Nethercutt's quote about losing soldiers in Iraq. Here is the full sentence (I have it on tape): ""It's a bigger and better and more important story than losing a couple of soldiers every day, which, which, heaven forbid, is awful."" As you know, the P-I put a period after ""day."" I contacted both the reporter and the editor and attempted to get the P-I to print a clarification, but to no avail. *** END QUOTE *** This struck us as a fairly minor complaint. The abridgment of Nethercutt's quote changed only its emphasis, not its meaning; and surely it goes without saying that the deaths of American servicemen are awful. But in light of the way the Post-Intelligencer has been savaging Nethercutt since then, we have to conclude Lane had a point. First came an Oct. 16 editorial http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/opinion/144006_iraqspined.html denouncing ""an effort to put a more positive spin on Americans' perception of the war in Iraq"": *** QUOTE *** Then there was U.S. Rep. George Nethercutt's ham-handed attempt to redirect news coverage and public attention to the war's positive side. ""It's a better and more important story than losing a couple of soldiers every day,"" the would-be senator gaffed at a gathering Monday. The family of Pfc. Kerry Scott of Concrete, who buried their young hero Tuesday, likely would not share Nethercutt's news judgment. *** END QUOTE *** Anyway, yesterday Nethercutt bought an ad in the Post-Intelligencer and the Seattle Times in which he accused the former paper of misquoting him, and this prompted the P-I to publish its first news story http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/145724_nethercutt28.html acknowledging the dispute. It quoted managing editor David McCumber standing by the story: ""Congressman Nethercutt was quoted accurately and within context by the P-I, and that's sort of the beginning and the end of it, as far as I'm concerned."" But it wasn't the end of it as far as the paper was concerned. Today the paper ran a petulant editorial http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/opinion/145809_nethercutted.html denouncing Nethercutt again: *** QUOTE *** Consider, again, the quote in question--fleshed out a bit more. ""The story of what we have done in the postwar period . . . is remarkable,"" Nethercutt said, because the coalition has been rebuilding power plants, police stations, schools and other infrastructure, as well as taking early steps toward self-governance. ""So the story is better than we might be led to believe in the news. I'm indicting the news people. It's a bigger and better and more important story than losing a couple of soldiers every day, which, which, heaven forbid, is awful."" A bigger and better story? Thank you, George, for clarifying your callow, shallow position. *** END QUOTE *** This followed a cartoon yesterday by the P-I's David Horsey http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/horsey/viewbydate.asp?id=914 , which depicted Nethercutt standing up in the middle of a church, raising his hand, and saying: ""Hey! Why don't you tell us the good news about Iraq?"" The pastor replies: ""Sorry, Mr. Nethercutt, maybe after the funeral."" (Just to be clear, Nethercutt actually made his comments at the University of Washington, not during a funeral.) Compare this with the P-I's response last year http://www.opinionjournal.com/best/?id=110002804#daycare , when Sen. Murray gave a speech in which she said the following about Osama bin Laden: *** QUOTE *** He's been out in these countries for decades, building schools, building roads, building infrastructure, building day care facilities, building health care facilities, and the people are extremely grateful. We haven't done that. *** END QUOTE *** The P-I published an editorial on Dec. 26 http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/opinion/101383_murrayed.shtml praising Murray for, as the headline put it, having the ""guts to stir needed debate."" The paper praised every bit of Murray's statement, including even the claim about ""day care centers""--after all, ""there is apparently a long-standing rumor"" that bin Laden ""built an orphanage."" Now that Americans like Kerry Scott are in Iraq and actually are building hospitals, schools and other facilities, the P-I wants to suppress the news.

"Once upon a time, in the small town of Winding Waters, the residents were going about their usual business, blissfully unaware of the galactic surprise that was about to land in their backyard.

It was a quiet Tuesday morning when Farmer Ted, who normally spent his days tending to his crops, stumbled upon a strange, otherworldly creature hiding behind his hay bales. It had shiny silver skin, big expressive eyes, and tentacles that seemed to dance in the sunlight. Farmer Ted, being a practical man, immediately thought of one thing: ""I hope it doesn't eat my corn.""

Word of the alien creature spread faster than gossip at a church potluck, and soon the entire town was buzzing with excitement, fear, and a healthy dose of curiosity. The Winding Waters Gazette ran a front-page story with the headline ""Alien Invasion or Friendly Neighbor?"" They even managed to include a blurry photo taken by Farmer Ted's nephew, Timmy, who was always fiddling with his new camera.

As the news spread, the inhabitants of Winding Waters divided into two distinct camps. On one side, we had the Alien Huggers - the folks who believed that the little silver creature was harmless and should be treated with love and respect. They saw it as an opportunity for intergalactic friendship and named it ""Spork,"" because it sort of looked like a spoon-fork hybrid.

On the other side of the spectrum were the Alien Fearsome - the residents who feared that Spork was a vicious extraterrestrial sent to terrorize the town and steal their cable television. Mrs. Jenkins, the town's resident conspiracy theorist, even started a Facebook group called ""Save Our Town from the Alien Menace!""

Town meetings were held in the local community center, where both sides argued their cases. Bill, the owner of the only barbershop in town, exclaimed, ""We need to call the government and have them send a team to capture that thing before it steals our cows!"" Meanwhile, Mildred, the town librarian, passionately defended Spork, declaring, ""We can't just judge an entire species based on a few Hollywood movies! Spork might be the only chance we have at interplanetary diplomacy!""

The mayor of Winding Waters, Mayor Thompson, scratched his head earnestly, trying to find a solution to this extraterrestrial predicament. But, as it turned out, there was no legal framework in place to deal with an alien creature visiting their town. The town's bylaws didn't cover this sort of thing. There was no ""Chapter 7: Alien Incidents"" to consult.

In the absence of a legal solution, the town decided to take matters into their own hands. They formed the Winding Waters Alien Interaction Committee (WWAIC) tasked with keeping an eye on Spork and ensuring the safety of the town, while also keeping it in good spirits.

The Alien Huggers, led by Mildred, organized a welcome party for Spork, complete with an ""out of this world"" buffet and a homemade banner that said ""Welcome, Spork!"" The Alien Fearsome, aka Mrs. Jenkins and her followers, protested outside, holding signs that read, ""Banish the Alien Scum!""

Under the watchful eye of the WWAIC, Spork began to bond with the town's children, who found its tentacles absolutely fascinating. It turned out that Spork was not interested in devouring corn or stealing cable television, but rather in learning about the quirks and customs of humans. Spork even mastered the art of playing fetch with Farmer Ted's faithful dog, Rufus.

As the months went by, Winding Waters became famous for its alien visitor. Tourists flocked to get a glimpse of Spork, and the town's economy thrived. The Alien Huggers and Alien Fearsome groups eventually began to soften their stances, realizing that Spork wasn't so different after all.

Winding Waters went from being a quiet little town to a hub of interstellar cultural exchange. And to celebrate their newfound galactic friendship, the town declared an annual ""Spork Day,"" where residents dressed up as aliens, paraded through the streets, and threw colorful confetti to honor their strange, silver-skinned neighbor.

So, even in a small town like Winding Waters, where nobody could have predicted such an extraordinary event, sometimes an alien creature can come along and turn everything upside down - in the best possible way. After all, who needs cable TV when you have a friendly, tentacled visitor from another galaxy?",1,0.0
"Introduction:

The concept of difference holds a significant place in the realm of philosophy, particularly in discussions surrounding identity and meaning-making. Philosophers throughout history have grappled with the complexities and implications of difference, seeking to understand its role in shaping our understanding of the world. This essay will explore the various perspectives of philosophers such as Leibniz, Kant, Saussure, Lévi-Strauss, and Derrida regarding the concept of difference and its relationship to identity.

Body:

1. Leibniz:
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, a prominent German philosopher, explored the concept of difference in his metaphysical framework. For Leibniz, the world is composed of an infinite number of monads, which are individual substances with unique qualities. Each monad represents a distinct viewpoint on the universe, emphasizing the inherent differences between entities. Leibniz argued that these differences contribute to the richness and diversity of existence. Moreover, he proposed the principle of the best of all possible worlds, suggesting that the world we inhabit is the optimal outcome among an infinite number of potential worlds, each characterized by different combinations of existing entities.

2. Kant:
Immanuel Kant, a renowned figure in modern philosophy, approached the concept of difference by focusing on the relationship between rationality and experience. For Kant, differences exist within the framework of human understanding, which is structured by the categories of the mind. He argued that the mind actively organizes sensory experiences using these categories, resulting in the formation of objective knowledge. Kant emphasized that difference is an essential aspect of perception, as it allows individuals to distinguish between objects and concepts. Moreover, he proposed that differences in perspective and judgment lead to the plurality of truths, recognizing the subjective nature of human knowledge.

3. Saussure:
Ferdinand de Saussure, a Swiss linguist and semiotician, contributed significantly to the understanding of difference within the realm of language and meaning-making. Saussure emphasized the fundamental role of difference in creating sign systems and constructing meaning. He introduced the concept of the signifier and the signified, stating that meaning is generated through the distinction between linguistic elements. According to Saussure, words derive their significance from their difference or contrast with other words within a language system. This notion of difference enables communication and the transmission of meaning within a particular linguistic community.

4. Lévi-Strauss:
Claude Lévi-Strauss, a French anthropologist, extended Saussure's ideas to the domain of cultural anthropology. He argued that differences are not limited to language but underpin the structure of society and culture. Lévi-Strauss believed that human societies are based on binary oppositions, such as nature/culture, raw/cooked, or male/female. These oppositions create meaning and order within a society, shaping its values, customs, and social structures. Lévi-Strauss's structuralist approach emphasizes the significance of difference as a fundamental organizing principle in human cultures.

5. Derrida:
Jacques Derrida, a prominent figure in poststructuralist philosophy, introduced the concept of différance as a way to challenge traditional notions of meaning and identity. Derrida argued that language and texts are inherently characterized by difference and absence. He posited that meaning is not fixed but is continually deferred and never fully present. Derrida critiqued the Western philosophical tradition for privileging presence and argued that difference is an essential aspect of language, questioning the stability and coherence of identity. Moreover, he highlighted the role of deconstruction in revealing the unfixed and unstable nature of meaning, constantly exposing the presence of difference.

Conclusion:

Throughout the history of philosophy, the concept of difference has played a crucial role in shaping our understanding of identity and meaning-making. From Leibniz's metaphysical framework to Derrida's deconstruction, various philosophers have explored and approached difference from distinct perspectives. These philosophers have demonstrated that difference is not only a fundamental aspect of existence but also an essential element in the construction of knowledge, language, culture, and social structures. By delving into the complexities and implications of difference, philosophers have expanded our comprehension of the world and our place within it.",1,0.0
"Te Pahu is a rural community nestled in the beautiful Waipa District of the Waikato region on New Zealand's North Island. It has a rich history dating back to the early Maori settlers who were drawn to the area's abundant natural resources and fertile lands.

The region now known as Te Pahu was originally occupied by the Waikato Tainui iwi, who established small settlements along the banks of the Waipa River. They relied heavily on the river for food, transportation, and trade. Evidence of their presence can still be seen in the form of archaeological sites and traditional place names that dot the landscape.

European colonization of the area began in the early 19th century. The arrival of missionaries and European settlers brought significant changes to the region. The British Crown acquired large tracts of land from the local Maori through controversial land purchase agreements. This led to tensions and conflicts, as the Maori felt dispossessed of their ancestral lands.

The first European settlers in Te Pahu were primarily farmers who recognized the agricultural potential of the area's fertile soils. They cleared the land and established dairy and sheep farms, which became the backbone of the local economy.

The development of infrastructure played a crucial role in the growth of Te Pahu. The construction of roads and bridges connected the community to neighboring towns and facilitated the transportation of goods. Over time, schools, churches, and other public buildings were also established, further enhancing the community's amenities.

Te Pahu experienced both natural disasters and challenges throughout its history. In 1958, the region was hit by a devastating flood that caused widespread damage to homes, farms, and infrastructure. The community rallied together to rebuild and recover, showcasing the resilience and strong spirit of its residents.

In recent years, Te Pahu has faced new challenges. The rise of urbanization and changes in agricultural practices have led to a decline in the population of the community. Many young people have left in search of better opportunities in larger towns and cities. This has resulted in an aging population and a decrease in the number of local businesses.

Despite these challenges, Te Pahu remains a close-knit community with a strong sense of pride in its rural identity. The region's natural beauty and serene landscapes continue to attract visitors who appreciate its tranquility. Efforts are being made to revitalize the community by promoting tourism and diversifying the local economy.

Today, Te Pahu is known not only for its farming heritage but also for its scenic beauty, hiking trails, and outdoor recreational activities. Its proximity to Hamilton, the largest city in the region, provides residents with access to urban amenities while maintaining the charm and tranquility of rural living.

In conclusion, Te Pahu's history is deeply rooted in the traditions of the Maori people and European settlers who shaped the region. Its agricultural heritage, natural beauty, and resilient community spirit make it an important part of the Waikato region's cultural and historical landscape.",1,0.0

"I have a routine. I go to work. I pick up Jordan from childcare. And then I go home. Sometimes we go to the park. Sometimes we go to the ritzy mall where nothing but white people hang out. And sometimes we play outside. But, for the most part, I have a very uneventful life so I have to comment on my week. Well, to touch on urlLink s.R's topic a couple of days ago about pick up lines, I was in the mall Monday. Why did this guy come up to me and my son. He was holding a little (big) girl who looked at least 4 or 5 years old. He asked me if I wouold take her to the bathroom. I was so astonished at the question that all I could do was open my mouth in shock. He was like, ""she can use it herself, I just don't want her to go in by herself."" I'm thinking, so you'd prefer me, a perfect stranger, with my own little boy running around rampant to take her in. You don't even know me. So I told him to take her into the men's bathroom so he could see what was going on. He said it was nasty in there and he didn't want to. I picked up my son and walked a way. He tried to follow but luckily this lady overheard our conversation and told him there was a family bathroom (unisex that is) for anyone with kids less than 10 feet away. We were right near the food court. I kina felt bad for a minute because the little girl was looking so pathetic like she knew this fool didn't know how to take her to the bathroom but when I looked back and saw them still standing around looking stupid I realized that her look was in total disgust because she knew the fool (who just so happened to have long hair and a perm) was using her to pick up chicks. I think using a child is worst than any pick up line. Especially asking someone to take her into the public bathroom. I work with a bunch of crazies so if he knew what I knew, he'd come up with something a little more practical, like: ""Hey baby, you married?"" That's the usual. Nothing major on Tuesday. Just Jordan's music class at Gymboree. My son is so musically inclined and I'm just sick of getting stared at by these white stay-at-home moms. Yea, I work. Yea, Jordan's dad is still around. Yea, I have a fat rock on my finger. And yea, we're Black and we can afford and love Gymboree. Get over it. Stop staring at us like we an extinct species. The are just amazed at how talented my little man is. He play the drums on beat, he doesn't have to be re-directed 10 times to pay attention, and he can dance. Why is that so shocking? Okay, this is not funny but it's still going under my ""Funniest week in a long time"" title. When Jordan does anything, intentional or accidental they look at him like he's just committed some major crime. These big ass white kids (he's in an advanced class for his age) cry and act like he's just chipped their tooth but let them do something it's like, Okay chase, you're getting too excited. No bitch! Your son just hit my baby and no he's not crying. And no there's no heart feelings. That's what kids do. For the record. White children are evil. Outside of childcare Jordan has no friends so he's always eager to play. They run from him. Take his instruments (he does too though) and try to brush him off. He's never like that with them but you know what. I think kids can get jealous just like adults can. I'm not going to lie, my son is the teacher's pet. They love him because he's so talented. Well, I think so anyway. And obviously the teachers do too because they're always in his face but he's probably a little above average in comparison to ethnic children. Why the hell do those white kids just sit there so uneffected by the sounds? I don't get it. It's just natural to nod your head when you hear rhythms right? Well, obviously not for these kids but to get to the point of all this blabbery. I'm sick of the dirty looks. I know parents are competitve but lets just face it, you child lost the race as soon as I found out about Gymboree and next session he'll be in art so I hope they're prepared. Last night. We went to this club...um bar with a dance floor called bada bing. That was the funniest shit I have every been to. Well, almost funniest. I don't know if I've mentioned how bootsey Sacramento is but the still try to gang bang out here. Why was it a bunch of want-a-be bloods at the bar last night? And they looked young at that. I thought the legal drinking age was 21 but maybe I'm wrong. I mean, I don't drink. The only reason I went to this place is because my co-worker had her graduation shin-dig there. So, I have never seen a bunch of men dance together before. NEVER. These dudes were doing moves I had never seen before. And on top of that they thought they looked good. They were dancing in the mirror. Raising their shirts up to show their scrongey assed chests and tatoos. And freaking fat women. No offense but there were only a hand full of people there and all the cute people wouldn't even look in their direction. Well, I take that back, we were all looking so that we can get a good laugh. I mean it was hilarious. I know I haven't been out in a while but I feel like I've been in prison",0,0.0
"have made their rendezvous there. An Etruscan lamp of red clay stood upon a Boule cabinet, with ebony panels, brightly striped by lines of inlaid brass; a duchess of the court of Louis xv. nonchalantly extended her fawn-like feet under a massive table of the time of Louis xiii., with heavy spiral supports of oak, and carven designs of chimeras and foliage intermingled. Upon the denticulated shelves of several sideboards glittered immense Japanese dishes with red and blue designs relieved by gilded hatching, side by side with enamelled works by Bernard Palissy, representing serpents, frogs, and lizards in relief. From disembowelled cabinets escaped cascades of silver-lustrous Chinese silks and waves of tinsel, which an oblique sunbeam shot through with luminous beads, while portraits of every era, in frames more or less tarnished, smiled through their yellow varnish. The striped breastplate of a damascened suit of Milanese armour glittered in one corner; loves and nymphs of porcelain, Chinese grotesques, vases of _cladon_ and crackleware, Saxon and old Svres cups encumbered the shelves and nooks of the apartment. The dealer followed me closely through the tortuous way contrived between the piles of furniture, warding off with his hand the hazardous sweep of my coat-skirts, watching my elbows with the uneasy attention of an antiquarian and a usurer. It was a singular face, that of the merchant; an immense skull, polished like a knee, and surrounded by a thin aureole of white hair, which brought out the clear salmon tint of his complexion all the more strikingly, lent him a false aspect of patriarchal _bonhomie_, counteracted, however, by the scintillation of two little yellow eyes which trembled in their orbits like two louis-d'or upon quicksilver. The curve of his nose presented an aquiline silhouette, which suggested the Oriental or Jewish type. His hands--thin, slender, full of nerves which projected like strings upon the finger-board of a violin, and armed with claws like those on the terminations of bats' wings--shook with senile trembling; but those convulsively agitated hands became firmer than steel pincers or lobsters' claws when they lifted any precious article--an onyx cup, a Venetian glass, or a dish of Bohemian crystal. This strange old man had an aspect so thoroughly rabbinical and cabalistic that he would have been burnt on the mere testimony of his face three centuries ago. 'Will you not buy something from me to-day, sir? Here is a Malay kreese with a blade undulating like flame. Look at those grooves contrived for the blood to run along, those teeth set backward so as to tear out the entrails in withdrawing the weapon. It is a fine character of ferocious arm, and will look well in your collection. This two-handed sword is very beautiful. It is the work of Josepe de la Hera; and this _colichemarde_ with its fenestrated guard--what a superb specimen of handicraft!' 'No; I have quite enough weapons and instruments of carnage. I want a small figure,--something which will suit me as a paper-weight, for I cannot endure those trumpery bronzes which the stationers sell, and which may be found on everybody's desk.' The old gnome foraged among his ancient wares, and finally arranged before me some antique bronzes, so-called at least; fragments of malachite, little Hindoo or Chinese idols, a kind of poussah-toys in jade-stone, representing the incarnations of Brahma or Vishnoo, and wonderfully appropriate to the very undivine office of holding papers and letters in place. I was hesitating between a porcelain dragon, all constellated with warts, its mouth formidable with bristling tusks and ranges of teeth, and an abominable little Mexican fetich, representing the god Vitziliputzili _au naturel_, when I caught sight of a charming foot, which I at first took for a fragment of some antique Venus. It had those beautiful ruddy and tawny tints that lend to Florentine bronze that warm living look so much preferable to the gray-green aspect of common bronzes, which might easily be mistaken for statues in a state of putrefaction. Satiny gleams played over its rounded forms, doubtless polished by the amorous kisses of twenty centuries, for it seemed a Corinthian bronze, a work of the best era of art, perhaps moulded by Lysippus himself. 'That foot will be my choice,' said to the merchant, who regarded me with an ironical and saturnine air, and held out the object desired that I might examine it more fully. I was surprised at its lightness. It was not a foot of metal, but in sooth a foot of flesh, an embalmed foot, a mummy's foot. On examining it still more closely the very grain of the skin, and the almost imperceptible lines impressed upon it by the texture of the bandages, became perceptible. The toes were slender and delicate, and terminated by perfectly formed nails, pure and transparent as agates. The great toe, slightly separated from the rest, afforded a happy contrast, in the antique style, to the position of the other toes, and lent it an aerial lightness--the grace of a bird's foot. The sole, scarcely streaked by a few almost imperceptible cross lines, afforded evidence that it had never touched the bare ground, and had only come in contact with the finest matting of Nile rushes and the softest carpets of panther skin. 'Ha, ha, you want the foot of the Princess Hermonthis!' exclaimed the merchant, with a strange giggle, fixing his owlish eyes upon me. 'Ha, ha, ha! For a paper-weight! An original idea!--artistic idea!-Old Pharaoh would certainly have been surprised had some one told him that the foot of his adored daughter would be used for a paper-weight after he had had a mountain of granite hollowed out as a receptacle for the triple coffin, painted and gilded, covered with hieroglyphics and beautiful paintings of the Judgment of Souls,' continued the queer little merchant, half audibly, as though talking to himself. 'How much will you charge me for this mummy fragment?' 'Ah, the highest price I can get, for it is a superb piece. If",0,0.0
"Nestled among the rolling hills of Hampshire stood a quaint old cottage, its timeworn exterior a testament to years gone by. It had stood there, weathering the tests of time, witnessing the passing seasons like a silent observer. But to the couple who called it home, this cottage was more than just walls and beams; it held a lifetime of memories and a love that had grown stronger with each passing year.

Emma and William had stumbled upon the cottage years ago, drawn to its rustic charm and the promise of tranquility. They had fallen in love with its creaky floors, the scent of old timber, and the way sunlight danced through the small, diamond-paned windows. The cottage had become their refuge, a place where they could escape the demands of the outside world and reconnect with one another.

As Emma sat by the crackling fireplace, her fingers tracing the grooves in the wooden mantelpiece, memories flooded her mind. She remembered the countless evenings spent curled up on the worn-out sofa, William's arm wrapped around her shoulders, their laughter mingling with the crackling fire. The cottage had witnessed their highs and lows, their triumphs and setbacks, and had stood as a steadfast witness to their unwavering love.

But it wasn't just the cottage that held their heart; it was the nature that enveloped it. The sprawling fields surrounding the cottage were their playground, their sanctuary. The couple would often take long walks, hand in hand, embracing the beauty that surrounded them. The sweet scent of wildflowers carried on the breeze, and the gentle rustle of leaves provided a soothing soundtrack to their conversations.

They took joy in the simple pleasures of life, finding solace in the rustling of the trees and the chirping of birds. Emma would often sit by the garden, her hands immersed in the rich earth, carefully tending to her blooming flowers. William, a man rooted in the soil of his upbringing, had passed his love for gardening down to his daughters. He took pleasure in teaching them the secrets of nature, nurturing their curiosities and fostering a deep appreciation for the world around them.

The couple's love for the cottage and its surroundings had deep roots. It was from this very cottage that Emma's father had set out years ago, his pockets filled with dreams and determination. He had returned years later, a successful man, with enough wealth to ensure his daughters would never want for anything. Yet, despite his newfound status, he chose to gift the cottage to Emma and William, recognizing the value of a simple, unassuming life amidst nature's embrace.

And so, the couple's connection to the cottage went far beyond its aging walls and overgrown garden. It was a testament to their love for each other, their appreciation for the natural world, and the legacy left by Emma's father. The cottage had become a vessel for their dreams, a place where time seemed to slow down, and the worries of the world faded away.

As twilight cast its golden glow over the Hampshire hills, Emma and William sat on the porch, their hands entwined, immersed in the silence of the evening. In that moment, they felt an unspoken gratitude for the life they had built, for the love that had endured, and for the cottage that had become their haven. Their connection to the old cottage and the surrounding nature ran deep, an unbreakable bond that would endure long after they were gone, leaving an indelible mark on the landscape of their love.",1,0.0
"Title: The Arial Board of Control: Safeguarding International Arrangements in the Age of Technological Autonomy

Introduction:

As the Official Reporter for the Arial Board of Control (A.B.C.), entrusted with chronicling the historical events that shape our world in the year 2065, I am privileged to share a remarkable tale of international cooperation and the delicate balance between technological autonomy and global harmony. In this narrative, I will recount the role played by the A.B.C. in response to a crisis that emerged when the District of Northern Illinois abruptly cut off all connections to global systems.

The District's Autonomy and Privacy Concerns:

Located in the heartland of the United States, the District of Northern Illinois had always prided itself on its self-sufficiency and independence. However, in the year 2065, it took an unprecedented step by seceding from all global systems: communication networks, financial platforms, and transportation grids. The District's rationale was rooted in its citizens' concerns about privacy and the increasing reliance on automated systems.

The Arial Board of Control Steps In:

This action posed a significant challenge to the international arrangements that had fostered peace, prosperity, and interconnectivity for decades. Recognizing the potential repercussions, the Arial Board of Control swiftly convened an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and devise a strategy to address the growing unrest.

A Task Force is Formed:

To gain a comprehensive understanding of the District's motives and find a diplomatic solution, the A.B.C. formed a specialized task force composed of esteemed members from various nations. The team included brilliant minds such as Dr. Li Wei, an artificial intelligence expert from China, Dr. Sophia O'Connor, a renowned legal scholar from Ireland, and Dr. Jamal Ahmed, an urban planning specialist from Egypt.

The A.B.C. team embarked on a journey to the District, utilizing the revolutionary A.B.C. boats, equipped with state-of-the-art technologies for transportation and communication. These boats were designed to uphold international laws and ensure the maintenance of global order.

Investigation and Mediation:

Upon arrival in the District of Northern Illinois, our team was met with skepticism and apprehension. The District's inhabitants felt that their privacy had been violated by the constant monitoring imposed by global systems. Our mission was to address these concerns while ensuring the preservation of international arrangements that had been the bedrock of global progress.

Through a series of dialogues, forums, and discussions with various stakeholders, we established a platform for mediation. The District's representatives, led by Mayor Elizabeth Thompson, were cautiously receptive to the A.B.C.'s involvement and willingness to listen.

The Challenges of Balancing Autonomy and Global Integration:

One of the key issues we encountered was finding a balance between the District's desire for privacy and the global community's need for interconnectedness. The District's inhabitants were understandably wary of relinquishing control over their private lives, but they also recognized the benefits of international cooperation and the potential consequences of isolation.

The A.B.C. proposed a framework that respected the District's autonomy while implementing safeguards to ensure the District's actions did not jeopardize the stability and security of the global community. This framework included the creation of a localized communication network, monitored solely by District authorities, while still adhering to internationally agreed-upon standards to prevent any abuse.

Resolving the Crisis:

After weeks of negotiation, compromise, and the unfaltering commitment of both the A.B.C. team and the District's representatives, a historic agreement was reached. The District of Northern Illinois would reestablish limited connections with global systems, albeit under a more stringent set of privacy and security protocols. This compromise aimed to appease both the District's citizens and the global community, ensuring a harmonious coexistence in an increasingly interconnected world.

Conclusion:

The crisis in the District of Northern Illinois was a wake-up call for the global community, emphasizing the delicate balance between individual privacy concerns and the necessity of international arrangements. The Arial Board of Control, through its dedicated team, demonstrated the importance of dialogue, understanding, and innovative solutions in safeguarding the interests of all parties involved.

As we move forward, the lessons learned from this incident will undoubtedly shape future policies and foster a renewed appreciation for autonomy, privacy, and global cooperation. The role played by the Arial Board of Control in resolving this crisis will stand as a testament to humanity's ability to adapt and find common ground in a rapidly changing world.",1,0.0
"from which no mortal finger could coax a ring. Also appertaining thereunto was a card bearing the name ""Mr. James Dillingham Young."" The ""Dillingham"" had been flung to the breeze during a former period of prosperity when its possessor was being paid $30 per week. Now, when the income was shrunk to $20, though, they were thinking seriously of contracting to a modest and unassuming D. But whenever Mr. James Dillingham Young came home and reached his flat above he was called ""Jim"" and greatly hugged by Mrs. James Dillingham Young, already introduced to you as Della. Which is all very good. Della finished her cry and attended to her cheeks with the powder rag. She stood by the window and looked out dully at a gray cat walking a gray fence in a gray backyard. Tomorrow would be Christmas Day, and she had only $1.87 with which to buy Jim a present. She had been saving every penny she could for months, with this result. Twenty dollars a week doesn't go far. Expenses had been greater than she had calculated. They always are. Only $1.87 to buy a present for Jim. Her Jim. Many a happy hour she had spent planning for something nice for him. Something fine and rare and sterling--something just a little bit near to being worthy of the honor of being owned by Jim. There was a pier-glass between the windows of the room. Perhaps you have seen a pierglass in an $8 flat. A very thin and very agile person may, by observing his reflection in a rapid sequence of longitudinal strips, obtain a fairly accurate conception of his looks. Della, being slender, had mastered the art. Suddenly she whirled from the window and stood before the glass. Her eyes were shining brilliantly, but her face had lost its color within twenty seconds. Rapidly she pulled down her hair and let it fall to its full length. Now, there were two possessions of the James Dillingham Youngs in which they both took a mighty pride. One was Jim's gold watch that had been his father's and his grandfather's. The other was Della's hair. Had the queen of Sheba lived in the flat across the airshaft, Della would have let her hair hang out the window some day to dry just to depreciate Her Majesty's jewels and gifts. Had King Solomon been the janitor, with all his treasures piled up in the basement, Jim would have pulled out his watch every time he passed, just to see him pluck at his beard from envy. So now Della's beautiful hair fell about her rippling and shining like a cascade of brown waters. It reached below her knee and made itself almost a garment for her. And then she did it up again nervously and quickly. Once she faltered for a minute and stood still while a tear or two splashed on the worn red carpet. On went her old brown jacket; on went her old brown hat. With a whirl of skirts and with the brilliant sparkle still in her eyes, she fluttered out the door and down the stairs to the street. Where she stopped the sign read: ""Mme. Sofronie. Hair Goods of All Kinds."" One flight up Della ran, and collected herself, panting. Madame, large, too white, chilly, hardly looked the ""Sofronie."" ""Will you buy my hair?"" asked Della. ""I buy hair,"" said Madame. ""Take yer hat off and let's have a sight at the looks of it."" Down rippled the brown cascade. ""Twenty dollars,"" said Madame, lifting the mass with a practised hand. ""Give it to me quick,"" said Della. Oh, and the next two hours tripped by on rosy wings. Forget the hashed metaphor. She was ransacking the stores for Jim's present. She found it at last. It surely had been made for Jim and no one else. There was no other like it in any of the stores, and she had turned all of them inside out. It was a platinum fob chain simple and chaste in design, properly proclaiming its value by substance alone and not by meretricious ornamentation--as all good things should do. It was even worthy of The Watch. As soon as she saw it she knew that it must be Jim's. It was like him. Quietness and value--the description applied to both. Twenty-one dollars they took from her for it, and she hurried home with the 87 cents. With that chain on his watch Jim might be properly anxious about the time in any company. Grand as the watch was, he sometimes looked at it on the sly on account of the old leather strap that he used in place of a chain. When Della reached home her intoxication gave way a little to prudence and reason. She got out her curling irons and lighted the gas and went to work repairing the ravages made by generosity added to love. Which is always a tremendous task, dear friends--a mammoth task. Within forty minutes her head was covered with tiny, close-lying curls that made her look wonderfully like a truant schoolboy. She looked at her reflection in the mirror long, carefully, and critically. ""If Jim doesn't kill me,"" she said to herself, ""before he takes a second look at me, he'll say I look like a Coney Island chorus girl. But what could I do--oh! what could I do with a dollar and eighty-seven cents?"" At 7 o'clock the coffee was made and the frying-pan was on the back of the stove hot and ready to cook the chops. Jim was never late. Della doubled the fob chain in her hand and sat on the corner of the table near the door that he always entered. Then she heard his step on the stair away down on the first flight, and she turned white for just a moment. She had a habit of saying a little silent prayer about the simplest everyday things, and now she whispered: ""Please",0,0.0
"the buildings of the Deimos Space Station. A typical comment from a sightseer is, ""Just think, Fred, we were way up there only twelve hours ago."" At fairly frequent intervals, the moons eclipse. The local Chamber of Commerce joins with the gambling casinos to use these occasions as excuses for a celebration. The ""Marsy Gras"" includes floats, costumes, liquor, women, gambling--and finishes off with a display of fireworks and a stiff note of protest from the nearby Mars Observatory. * * * * * The day after a particularly noisy, glaring fireworks display, the top brass at the Observatory called an emergency meeting. The topic was not a new one, but fresh evidence, in the form of several still-wet photographic plates, showing out-of-focus skyrocket trails and a galaxy of first-magnitude aerial cracker explosions was presented. ""I maintain they fire them in our direction on purpose,"" one scientist declared. This was considered to be correct because the other directions around town were oil refineries and the homes of the casino owners. ""Why don't we just move the Observatory way out in the desert?"" a technician demanded. ""It wouldn't be much of a job."" ""It would be a tremendous job,"" said Dr. Morton, the physicist. ""If not for the glare of city lights on Earth, we wouldn't have had to move our telescopes to the Moon. If not for the gravel falling out of the sky on the Moon, making it necessary to resurface the reflectors every week, we wouldn't have had to move to Mars. Viewing conditions here are just about perfect--except for the immense cost of transporting the equipment, building materials, workmen, and paying us triple time for working so far from home. Why, did you ever figure the cost of a single photographic plate? What with salaries, freight to and from Earth, maintenance and all the rest, it's enormous!"" ""Then why don't we cut down the cost of ruined exposures,"" asked the technician, ""by moving the Observatory away from town?"" ""Because,"" Dr. Morton explained, ""we'd have to bring in crews to tear the place down, other crews to move it, still more crews to rebuild it. Not to mention unavoidable breakage and replacement, which involve more freight from Earth. At $7.97 per pound dead-weight ... well, you figure it out."" ""So we can't move and we can't afford ruined thousand-dollar plates,"" said the scientist who had considered himself a target for the fireworks. ""Then what's the answer?"" The usual suggestion was proposed that a delegation approach the Town Council to follow up the letter of protest. A search through the past meetings' minutes showed that this had never accomplished anything up to date. A recent arrival to the Observatory mentioned that their combined brain power should be enough to beat the games and thus force the casino owners--who were the real offenders--out of business. One of the scientists, who had already tried that very scheme on a small scale, reported his results. He proved with his tabulations that, in this instance, science, in the guise of the law of averages, was unfortunately against them. Dr. Morton rose to his feet. The other men listened to his plan, at first with shocked horror, then with deep interest and finally in wild exultation. The meeting broke up with most of the members grinning from ear to ear. ""It's lucky Dr. Morton is a physicist,"" said one of the directors. ""No astronomer would ever have thought of that."" * * * * * A few days later a modest little ad appeared in the weekly publication ""What to do in Marsport."" It did not try to compete with any of the casino ads (all of which featured pretty girls), but it had a unique heading. FREE For the First Time Ever Your HOROSCOPE SCIENTIFICALLY CAST by the Staff of the FAMOUS MARS OBSERVATORY Learn your Luck, your Future! Write or call Mars Observatory. No charge. No obligation. Since the horoscopes being offered were about the only things on Mars that didn't cost the tourists any money, the response was great. The recipient of a horoscope found a mimeographed folder which contained three pages describing the present positions of the planets, where to look for Earth in the sky, and what science hoped to learn the next time Mercury was in transit. The fourth page held the kicker. It said that while the tourist's luck would be better than average at most of the gambling houses, he would lose consistently if he played at Harvey's Club. Within two days the only people playing at Harvey's were the shills. The following day, the visitors to the observatory included Harvey. The gambler was welcomed with mingled respect for his money and contempt for his occupation. He was taken immediately to see Dr. Morton, who greeted him with a sly smile. Harvey's conversation was brief and to the point. ""How much?"" he asked waving a horoscope under Dr. Morton's nose. ""Just a promise,"" said the scientist. Harvey said nothing but looked sullen. ""You are on the Town Council,"" Morton continued. ""Now, the next time the question of tourist entertainment is discussed, we want you to vote _against_ a fireworks display."" He then explained how important plates had been ruined by skyrocket trails. Harvey listened with great interest, especially when Dr. Morton flatly stated that each casino, in turn, would get the same publicity in the horoscopes. ""The Council members are all for the tourists,"" Harvey commented, ""and you guys are supposed to be nuts, like all scientists. But I'll do like you say."" He reached into his pocket. ""Here's fifty bucks. Use it for a full page ad this time and do the Desert Sands Casino in your next horoscope. And say--before I go, can I look through the telescope? I never seemed to have the time before."" * * * * * At weekly intervals, Dr. Morton ""did"" the Desert Sands; Frankland's Paradise; the Martian Gardens; and the Two Moons Club.

"""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is a thought-provoking documentary film by Michael Moore that delves into the presidency of George W. Bush and the aftermath of the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks. As a liberal viewer, I found this film to be a powerful critique of the Bush administration and its actions during his presidency.

One of the main themes of ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is the portrayal of President Bush as an incompetent leader. Moore presents various instances where Bush appears clueless, such as the infamous moment where he sat in a Florida classroom reading a book during the initial stages of the 9/11 attacks. This scene, along with many others, is used to argue that Bush was ill-prepared and lacked the necessary judgment to effectively respond to such a crisis.

The film also highlights the connections between the Bush family and prominent figures in the Saudi Arabian government, including the bin Laden family. Moore suggests that these connections influenced the Bush administration's response to 9/11 and subsequent actions in the Middle East. This portrayal raises important questions about the motivations behind the Iraq War and the potential conflicts of interest within the Bush administration.

Another significant aspect of ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is its depiction of the war in Iraq. Moore presents a grim picture of the consequences of the invasion, emphasizing the human toll on both American soldiers and Iraqi civilians. The film challenges the justifications given for the war and argues that it was driven by ulterior motives, such as control of oil and geopolitical power.

One of the film's strengths is its ability to blend serious political commentary with moments of humor. Moore uses satire and irony to critique the Bush administration's policies and highlight the absurdity of certain situations. For example, he juxtaposes images of Bush golfing with news of soldiers dying in Iraq, creating a powerful visual contrast that underscores the disconnect between the president's actions and the reality faced by those affected by the war.

Personally, I was deeply affected by several scenes in the film. One that stood out to me was the testimony of Lila Lipscomb, a mother who lost her son in Iraq. This heartfelt moment humanized the cost of war and conveyed the anguish experienced by countless families who have lost loved ones in military conflicts. It was a raw and emotional moment that reminded me of the real-life consequences of political decisions.

However, it is important to note that ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" has faced its fair share of controversy. The film's release was limited in certain areas, with claims of political censorship by conservative voices. This controversy only served to underscore the powerful impact and divisive nature of the film's message.

In conclusion, ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is a provocative documentary that challenges the actions and motivations of the Bush administration. Through its critique of President Bush, the portrayal of the war in Iraq, and its political commentary, the film raises important questions about the role of government and the consequences of political decisions. While it may not be without its critics, I believe that ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is an important piece of filmmaking that encourages viewers to critically examine power and question those in authority.",1,0.0
"The construction of a massive bridge over the mighty Ganges River was no ordinary feat. It required the expertise, determination, and ingenuity of a team of talented engineers who were tasked with conquering the numerous challenges posed by this colossal project. From conceptualization to completion, the construction of this bridge spanned several years, each one marked with significant progress and remarkable achievements.

The first hurdle the engineers faced was selecting the most suitable location for the bridge. This required meticulous analysis of the river's flow, sedimentation patterns, and geological stability. Extensive surveys and geotechnical investigations were carried out to identify the optimal position where the bridge's foundations could be securely established. After careful consideration, a location was chosen that provided a strong foundation, minimized environmental impact, and maximized connectivity between the two banks of the river.

Once the location was determined, the next challenge was to design the bridge itself. The engineers aimed for a structure that would withstand the test of time, with the capacity to carry heavy loads, withstand seismic activity, and resist the strong currents of the Ganges River. Computer-aided design and simulation software were employed to create intricate structural models that took into account various factors, such as wind loads and the dynamic behavior of the bridge under different conditions.

An essential aspect of the bridge's construction was the establishment of solid foundations. Due to the water depth and the constantly shifting riverbed, deep-water piling techniques were employed. Enormous steel and concrete piles were driven deep into the riverbed until they reached a rock or clay stratum that provided sufficient load-bearing capacity. These piles formed the backbone of the bridge's foundation, ensuring the stability and safety of the entire structure.

After the foundation was established, work began on erecting the massive piers that would support the bridge deck. These piers, made of reinforced concrete, were constructed in segments, each carefully designed to handle the immense weight and forces exerted by the bridge. Advanced formwork systems were utilized to mold the concrete into shape, ensuring precision, strength, and durability.

Simultaneously, the bridge deck was constructed using precast segments made of high-strength concrete. These segments were manufactured off-site, under controlled conditions, and then transported to the site for assembly. This approach not only expedited construction but also ensured the quality and integrity of the bridge deck. The segments were precisely positioned and post-tensioned together, forming a continuous deck that would carry vehicles, pedestrians, and the weight of the entire bridge.

Throughout the construction process, the engineers faced numerous logistical challenges. The sheer size and complexity of the project necessitated extensive coordination between various teams, contractors, and suppliers. The delivery of raw materials, such as steel and concrete, had to be carefully synchronized to avoid delays. Additionally, the construction site itself presented challenges in terms of accessibility, especially during the monsoon season when the river swelled and access roads became impassable. The engineers had to devise innovative strategies, including temporary ferry services and alternative transportation routes, to ensure smooth progress despite these hurdles.

As the bridge construction progressed, it began to dominate the landscape, a testament to the dedicated efforts of the engineering team. Over time, the bridge's pylons rose above the water's surface, and the segments of the deck connected the two banks of the river. The vision was gradually transforming into reality.

Finally, after years of relentless effort, the day arrived when the construction of the bridge was complete. The engineers meticulously inspected every aspect, ensuring that it complied with the highest safety standards. The bridge underwent rigorous testing to assess its structural integrity and load-bearing capacity, ensuring its readiness for public use.

The completion of the bridge over the Ganges River was eventually celebrated as an engineering marvel. It represented an impressive fusion of technological innovation, meticulous planning, and unwavering determination. The bridge not only provided a vital link between previously isolated communities but also became a symbol of progress, connecting the past with the future. The challenges faced by the engineers during the construction process were ultimately overcome through their expertise, perseverance, and unwavering commitment to excellence.",1,0.0

A Divisional Level assault can easily be played on a standard 8' x 6' table, whilst a heliborne assault on a vital bridge can be played on a 2' x 2' table. Thus allowing several campaign battles to take place in one evening. Bruce Rea Taylor and Andy Ashton originally intended that Corps Commander would be the start of a family of rules, each covering a period and location, as can be seen by the quote from the Rules. Rules covering sea and airborne assaults, together with details of the Northern and Southern Fronts and the Middle East will follow shortly. Operational Manoeuvre Group was the first of the Corps Commander / Korps Commander publications. Bruce Rea Taylor [2] died three years after the publication of these rules (1989), at the age of 40. I was unable to find any evidence Andy Ashton made any plans to continue this project. Bruce Rea Taylor gives a special mention to the Wallasey Wargames Club in the Introduction of the Korps Commander Rules. he used wargaming clubs as a method to play test his rules system. We would like to acknowledge the help of the Wallasey War-games Club in the preparation and play testing of these rules, and also those in Nottingham (Rob at Heroes is the one to contact). Please send a Stamped Addressed Envelope if you have any queries. The primary significance of these rules was it was one of the first game systems which used a scale of 1-2 base(s) per company. The reason why a scale of 1 base per company was not used was to allow for small formations, such as 1-2 SP-AA weapons allocated to a HQ and to ensure the record keeping for the standard company sized formations was not too difficult. However, apart from this, the rules attempted to use a 1 Base = 1 company scale, which allowed players to command one, or more, divisions. Compared with the most common rules used in this period, this was unusual. In practice the detail and complexity of the rules precluded any possibility of playing a corps level game within a reasonable time frame. Most games would typically field 50 bases, or elements, per side. This represents a force of 25 companies per side. A game of this size which consisted of 12 game-turns, or one game day duration, could be completed within a 4-8 hour period. Bruce Rea Taylor and Andy Ashton published Corps Commander in July 1986. This used the same game system as Korps Commander and can be considered the first of the Corps/Korps Commander system publications. In October 1986 ""Digest #3, Engineering Equipment Data, Engineering Lists, Engineering Scenarios"" was published, this contained additional material for Corps Commander. In June 1988 ""Corps Commander: By Air & Sea"" was published, containing yet more supporting material for Corps Commander. The final publication in this family was in August 1988 when ""Korps Commander"" was published. While Bruce Rea Taylor published a number of additional books after August 1988, they were all dated after his death on the 3rd of March 1989.[3] No additional Corp/Korps Commander books were published after August 1988. These post August 1988 publications are listed here: There is strong evidence Bruce Rea Taylor built on his earlier rules, Challenger and Firefly, when developing the Corp/Korps Commander Rules. This is especially evident in the equipment specification. Corps Commander was published in July 1986. Shortly after this an errata sheet was published which was printed on the inside cover of the rules. Digest #3, published in Oct 1986, and contained some additional supporting information, but no changes to the rules. The Air & Sea supplement, printed in June 1988, contained a large number of additional rules, as well as some minor changes to the base rules. The publishing of Korps Commander, in August 1988, contained a large number of changes to the rules. A number of these were as a result of the period, such as the game scale, however a number represents corrections to the original Corps Commander rules. A number of unusual tactics were available to players of the original Corps Commander rules, which Korps Commander eliminated. In additional to this a number of other changes were implemented which improved the accuracy of the rules. These included; It is likely that these changes were intended to be added to corps commander in a possible future publication, however this never occurred. Ground Scale (1/300 scale) : Each centimetre represents 100 metres (1:10000) Game-Turn Scale : Each daylight Turn represents 1 hour of actual time. Each night Turn represents 2 hour of actual time. Base/Stand Scale - Each base represents a company, part of a company or a platoon. A Base can have a maximum of 9 Strength points. (If there are more than 9 vehicles or Gun's in a Company, the Company is split into two bases, each of which are similar in strength. This system allows a base to also represent a platoon, such as a support platoon attached to a Headquarters company.) Base Size (1/300 scale) - A Base which has 1 to 5 strength points has a size of 20mm by 30mm. A Base with more than 5 strength points has a size of 30mm by 30mm. For comparison purposes the later Korps Commander used a Ground scale of 5 cm = 1 km (1:5000) and a Daylight Game",0,0.0

"upside down. ""How anybody in their right mind...."" he growled at her. ""Listen, you've already been to Mars. You've seen it. What do you want to go to that miserable, dried-up hole again for?"" ""Because ... because I was happy there,"" she said tremulously. ""What? With those miserable savages?"" He slapped his euphoria pipe down on the table. ""Ethel, will you listen to that?"" Joyce's mother, plump and round-shouldered and vague-eyed, was deep in her reclining chair, the miniature transviewer on her lap, watching a garden party in Rome. ""What is it, dear?"" she asked unhappily. ""This crazy girl wants to take her vacation on Mars again."" ""Well ... it _is_ educational,"" Ethel said. Harley made a wild, exasperated sound. ""What do you know about it? You've never been there. It's a dried-up hole, I tell you. It's a slum--it's one great big slum. Just one decent hotel in the whole place, and that's only because some of our boys went out there and put it up for them."" ""That awful hotel--"" Joyce caught herself. Not an argument about this, please! There was trouble enough waiting for her. ""I wouldn't stay at the hotel,"" she said quietly. ""What do you mean? Where would you stay?"" ""With some people I know there."" She saw his heavy eyebrows clench, saw his eyes search her suspiciously. She heard her mother's uneasy movements. She sat tautly, her hands in her lap. ""Who,"" Harley said finally, ""are these people?"" ""Just ... some friends,"" Joyce said. Now it was coming, now, now. ""What friends?"" Her father's voice was lower, harsher. ""Just some people I met when I was there last time."" ""Just some.... Say! Is this why we've been running up these solarphone bills? What've you been doing--talking to these people every week?"" ""Only a few times."" ""Look here. Look at me. Joyce, answer me. Have you been talking to that fellow you told us about--the one you met on your other trip?"" She let it out, a tiny, miserable, ""Yes."" Harley's hand slammed down on the table. He wrestled his heavy body up out of his chair, stamped halfway across the room toward her and stopped. ""Young lady, I'm not going to have this. I'm not going to have anything like this! You hear? You want to get tangled up with him? My God, you've been communicating with him for a _year_?"" ""Whenever I was able to,"" Joyce said hoarsely, looking at the floor. ""Joyce!"" He came to her, reached down and lifted her chin. ""Joyce, you're not--you're not in love with this--this creature!"" She nodded, suddenly angered at her weakness, angered at the wetness in her eyes. ""Oh, my God!"" Harley raised his arms, brought them down with a slap against his thighs. He turned away from her. He glared at his wife, who was drifting nervously up out of her chair. He turned back to Joyce. ""You're not serious. You can't be. This can't--this just can't happen to us. You'll have to get this foolishness out of your head right now. Right this minute. My God, the next thing you know, you'll be wanting to marry one of those things."" ""I do...."" The sound barely came out. She swallowed, forced her voice up. ""I am going to marry him."" * * * * * A blast of silence swept the room, but, strangely, the shock of it didn't touch her. All at once, she was calm, quiet. She had said it, and now she was armored against everything. ""No,"" her father was saying dully. ""No, Joyce. No."" ""I'm sorry, Dad,"" she said all in a rush. ""I've thought about it a long time. I thought I'd forget him after a little while. I wasn't able to. I'm in love with him--I'll always be in love with him. When I come back, I'm bringing him with me. We're going to be married here."" Now, finally, the storm broke out of him. He yelled at her, he stamped around, his fists pounded the air--it was just as she had pictured it, dreaded it. Yet she was unshaken now, detachedly able to watch him as if he were some unruly, unintelligent child. I am going to marry him, she had said, and once the words were out, everything else was easy. There were no problems. There was nothing to be afraid of. ""His name is Gregrill,"" she said. ""They don't have last names. We'll have to make one up or perhaps use mine."" ""I'll see my daughter dead before I let her marry a Martian!"" Harley roared. ""But if she really loves him--"" Ethel intruded timorously. ""Loves him? Love that miserable scum?"" ""Dad, please,"" Joyce said quietly. ""You're condemning somebody you've never seen."" ""I don't have to see him! He's a Martian, isn't he? He has horns, doesn't he?"" ""They're not horns. They're antennae."" ""Call them what you like, they're horns!"" ""They're antennae, Dad,"" Joyce repeated firmly. ""They're proof of advanced development. They can communicate with each other hundreds of miles. They can sense instantly--"" ""I don't want to hear about it!"" ""But, dear,"" Ethel tried again, ""sometimes, when they marry an Earthling girl, they cut those horns off, and then they look just like us."" ""I wouldn't let him--"" Joyce bit off each word--""do any such thing. I'd be utterly ashamed of him. I wouldn't marry him if he knuckled under to our prejudices like that. What does he have to be apologetic about? He's a superior being--"" ""Superior?"" her father howled at her, but his voice was losing its power. * * * * * ""In spite of our buildings and machines and things, they're far richer than we are, really. They have such a richness of feeling, such warmth, such sensitivity. They understand and feel so much more than we do. It's--it's fantastic. It's just something we can't comprehend."" ""I see,"" he said bitterly. ""And how are you going to comprehend them?"" ""Gregrill can speak Earthling as well as I can,"" Joyce said.",0,0.0
"I've been meaning to sit down and write about my complicated relationship with my father for quite some time now. It's always been a bit of a touchy subject, but I think it's important to put my thoughts and feelings into words. My father, well, he certainly wasn't your typical dad. He had this knack for attracting women, and unfortunately, he couldn't help himself from getting involved with multiple women at the same time. Yeah, I know, it sounds like a soap opera, but that was my reality growing up.

To say that his behavior put a strain on our family would be an understatement. I watched my mother, a strong and independent woman, struggle to make sense of it all. She did her best to shield my siblings and me from the turmoil that was happening behind closed doors, but kids aren't oblivious. We knew something was off, even if we couldn't quite put our finger on it.

It wasn't long before the façade started to crumble. My father's infidelity became apparent, as his mysterious attending to ""business trips"" started to raise eyebrows. Rumors began to spread, and my mom was left feeling humiliated and hurt. Our once tight-knit family was starting to fall apart, all because of my father's choices.

I was angry at him, no doubt about it. How could he do this to us? Didn't he care about the consequences? I questioned his love for us and couldn't understand how he could be so selfish. But as much as I wanted to distance myself from him, I couldn't deny the fact that he was still my father. And despite all the pain he caused, I couldn't help but feel a sense of protectiveness towards him. It's funny how love can be so intertwined with anger and confusion.

There were times when I would meet the different women in my father's life. It was a constant rotation, as one would come into the picture while another would fade away. Each time, I would go through a whirlwind of emotions. I felt jealousy towards these women, as if they were somehow stealing my father away from me. I resented them for being a part of his life when they had no idea what they were getting themselves into.

But there were also moments of curiosity. I wanted to understand what drew my father to these women, what made him seek their affection instead of being content with our family. I would observe their interactions, trying to decipher some sort of pattern. What did he see in them that he didn't see in us? It was a puzzle I could never solve.

As I grew older, I started to realize that my father's behavior was not a reflection of my worth or the worth of our family. His inability to commit wasn't about us; it was about his own struggles and insecurities. I came to understand that his actions were not a result of any lack on our part, but rather a reflection of his own emotional baggage.

And so, I began to let go of the anger and resentment. It wasn't easy, mind you, but it was necessary for my own well-being. I had to accept that my father's choices were his own, and they didn't define me or my family. I started to focus on nurturing the relationships with the people who truly valued and loved me unconditionally.

Today, my father and I have a complicated relationship. We've had our fair share of ups and downs, and there are still moments when I struggle with trust and forgiveness. But I've learned that forgiveness isn't about condoning the hurtful actions; it's about freeing myself from the burden of anger and resentment. It's about choosing my own path and not allowing his mistakes to define me.

So, as I reflect on this complicated relationship with my father, I am grateful for the lessons it has taught me. It has made me stronger, more empathetic, and more resilient. And while I may never fully understand my father's choices, I can find solace in the fact that I have grown into a person who is capable of love, forgiveness, and self-acceptance.",1,0.0
"So, let me tell you about my wild adventure working as a bartender in a mountain resort and spa in Southern Ecuador. It was quite an experience, filled with breathtaking landscapes, charming locals, and a fair share of mishaps. But hey, that's what makes a traveler's story worth telling, right?

Picture this: I'm nestled in the heart of the Andes Mountains, surrounded by lush greenery and snow-capped peaks. It's like being in a postcard, except I get to live it every single day. The air is fresh, the mornings are crisp, and the views are absolutely jaw-dropping. It's the kind of place that ignites your wanderlust and makes you feel alive.

Working as a bartender in this little mountain oasis was a dream come true. I spent my days mixing up exotic cocktails, chatting with interesting guests from all corners of the world, and soaking up the vibrant atmosphere. The local staff were incredibly warm and welcoming, always ready to share stories about their traditions and customs. It was like having a second family.

But as they say, life is all about ups and downs. And boy, did I have my fair share of downs. One evening, while preparing a fancy drink for a group of rowdy tourists, I managed to slice my finger open with a knife. Blood gushed out like a scene from a horror movie, and I couldn't help but panic.

Luckily, the resort had a well-equipped first aid kit, and one of my co-workers swiftly guided me to the on-site nurse. The process of getting medical attention was surprisingly smooth and affordable. The nurse skillfully cleaned and bandaged my finger, offering reassurance along the way. I couldn't help but be grateful for the accessibility of healthcare in that part of the world.

Despite this little hiccup, my time in Southern Ecuador was nothing short of incredible. On my days off, I would hike to nearby waterfalls, explore the charming villages, and enjoy the mesmerizing sunsets. There was always something new to discover and admire.

One of my favorite memories was visiting a local indigenous community. The community welcomed me with open arms, sharing their traditions, dances, and unbelievable stories. It was a humbling experience, witnessing their strong ties to nature and their deep respect for the land. It made me realize just how interconnected we all are, no matter where we come from.

However, not everything was sunshine and rainbows. The language barrier sometimes proved to be a challenge, especially when trying to communicate with some of the older locals. Sometimes, I would end up ordering the wrong dish at a restaurant or getting lost in translation. But hey, those moments added some spice to my adventure and gave me a good laugh afterwards.

As my time in Southern Ecuador came to an end, I couldn't help but feel a bittersweet mixture of excitement and sadness. On one hand, I was eager to continue exploring new destinations and immersing myself in different cultures. But on the other hand, I knew I would miss the charm of this mountain paradise and the connections I had made.

Looking back, my adventure in Southern Ecuador taught me so much about resilience, adaptability, and the beauty of embracing the unknown. Despite the occasional mishaps, I wouldn't trade those months for anything. Travel isn't just about ticking off landmarks and taking Instagram-worthy pictures; it's about immersing yourself in the culture, pushing your comfort zone, and learning about yourself along the way.

So here's to the wild adventures, unexpected turns, and unforgettable memories that make travel so incredible. And if you ever find yourself in Southern Ecuador, be sure to soak up the scenery, meet the locals, and watch out for rogue knives. Trust me, it's an adventure you won't soon forget.",1,0.0
"The Edgewater Beach Hotel was a resort hotel complex on Lake Michigan in the far-north neighborhood community of Edgewater in Chicago, Illinois, designed by Benjamin H. Marshall[5] and Charles E. Fox. The first multi-story building was built in 1916, for its owners John Tobin Connery and James Patrick Connery, located between Sheridan Road and Lake Michigan at Berwyn Avenue in a Spanish Revival style. An adjacent south tower building was added in 1924, with a low connecting passageway-building to serve as reception and additional public rooms.[6] The resort, which included beaches, pools, clubs, and gardens hosted famous movie and sports stars, and later Martin Luther King Jr.[7] The hotel was also the setting for the celebrity stalking case and shooting that inspired the novel and movie The Natural. The hotel buildings closed in 1967, and were soon after demolished. The Edgewater Beach Apartments to the north were completed as part of the hotel resort complex in 1928. The ""sunset pink"" apartments complemented the ""sunrise yellow"" hotel buildings in a similar architectural style.[8] The apartments remain and have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Designed by Chicago-based architects Marshall and Fox in September 1915, the complex comprised several buildings and recreation grounds. The Main Building, modeled in the shape of a croix fourchée (""forked cross""), initially had 400 rooms and opened on June 3, 1916. It quickly became a success, with a one-story addition to the northeast and southeast wings of the building added in 1919. In April 1923, construction began on a $3 million, 19 story, 600-room tower addition to the south of the Main Building.[9] The Tower Building, which opened for occupancy on February 9, 1924, had a stepped design, tallest at its center, with lower sections to the east and west of the center. The addition, initially called the Annex, was connected to the Main Building by a large hall known as the Passaggio.[10] High-end shops lined the ground floor of the Sheridan Road side, and a marble-tiled open air dance floor and bandshell, known as the Beach Walk, faced the Lake Michigan side. The hotel had a 1,200-foot private beach and offered seaplane service to downtown Chicago.[1][11] When both buildings were initially constructed, the hotel sat 20 feet (6.1 m) from Lake Michigan.[12] The 1933 extension of Lake Shore Drive north to Foster Avenue resulted in the creation of a private bathing beach east of the hotel and north of Foster along the Lake Michigan shore.[11][13] The hotel served many famous guests, including Marilyn Monroe, Frank Sinatra, Judy Garland, Charlie Chaplin, Bette Davis, Lena Horne, Tallulah Bankhead, Nat King Cole, and U.S. Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Dwight D. Eisenhower. The hotel was known for hosting big bands such as those of Benny Goodman, Tommy Dorsey, Glenn Miller, Artie Shaw, Xavier Cugat, Dan Russo, Ted Fiorito, and Wayne King, which were also broadcast on the hotel's own radio station, a precursor to WGN, with the call letters WEBH. In January 1963, Martin Luther King Jr. spoke at the hotel at the Conference on Religion and Race.[7] In the winter months, the bands played in the Marine Dining Room and, in the summer months, outdoors on the Beach Walk. On the first floor of the hotel, guests walked on a wooden gangway into the Yacht Club for cocktails. In the early days women were not permitted to sit at the bar.[14] On June 14, 1949, Philadelphia Phillies first baseman Eddie Waitkus was shot and nearly killed by an obsessive fan at the hotel, 19-year-old Ruth Steinhagen; this later would be a large part of the inspiration behind Bernard Malamud's novel The Natural.[15][16] The 1951–54 extension of Lake Shore Drive from Foster Avenue to Hollywood Avenue reduced direct access to Lake Michigan, leading to a reduction in business. This roadway was built on landfill in the area that had been the private beach for the hotel. While new public beaches serving the Edgewater neighborhood were eventually created, they did not replace the hotel's own beach. After the hotel was cut off from the lake by the new drive, a swimming pool was added in 1953. In 1960, in order to compete with popular downtown hotels, the Edgewater Beach underwent a $900,000 renovation which included the installation of air conditioning. Approximately 30% of rooms, including restaurants and public spaces of the hotel, were fitted with air conditioning. By 1961, that number rose to nearly 70%.[17] From January 14–17, 1963, the National Conference on Religion and Race was held at the resort. Martin Luther King Jr., assisted by Wyatt Tee Walker, was on the steering committee for the conference, which was called by the National Council of Churches, Synagogue Council of America, and the National Catholic Welfare Conference. King gave a major address at the conference, ""A Challenge to Justice and Love"", to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation. He called the conference, ""the most significant and historic ever held for attacking racial injustice."" A statement in support of civil rights from President John F. Kennedy was read and Abraham J. Heschel also spoke. The conference adopted An Appeal to the Conscience of the American People for a moral end to racism.[18] The Edgewater Beach Co-op Apartments, built in 1928, at the north end of the property,[4] and shown in the photo at right, is the only part of the hotel complex to survive and is part of the Bryn Mawr Historic District. As he had before with many his other projects, such as the South Shore Country Club, the Blackstone Hotel, the Drake Hotel and Drake Tower, architect Benjamin Marshall designed the apartment building with accoutrements suited for the well-to-do.[19] It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. The apartments stand at the north end of Lake Shore Drive, quite visible to the passing traffic, and unusual in Chicago for the ""sunset pink"" exterior. When both stood, the color coordinated with the ""sunrise yellow"" of the hotel.[8] The retail portion of",0,0.0
"dress. With him at the table in the restaurant were other similarly clad men, evidently of good station in life, and in their answers and comments these men addressed the white-haired man as Commodore. A navy captain, I thought, promoted on retirement. His talk bore it out. ""Yes, sirree,"" he said, as he thumped the table mildly. ""A good, tight merchant ship, with nothing wrong except what might be ascribed to neglect such as light canvas blown away and ropes cast off the pins, with no signs of fire, leak, or conflict to drive the crew out, with plenty of grub in the stores and plenty of water in the tanks. Yet, there she was, under topsails and topgallant-sails, rolling along before a Biscay sea, and deserted, except that the deck was almost covered with dead rats."" ""What killed them, Commodore,"" asked one; ""and what happened to the crew?"" ""Nobody knows. It might have been a poisonous gas from the cargo, but if so it didn't affect us after we boarded her. The log-book was gone, so we got no information from that. Moreover, every boat was in its chocks or under its own davits. It was as though some mysterious power had come down from above and wiped out the crew, besides killing the rats in the hold. She was a grain ship from 'Frisco, and grain ships are full of rats. ""I was the prize-lieutenant that took her into Queenstown. She was condemned in Admiralty proceedings and, later, restored to her owners. But to this day no man has told the story of that voyage. It is thirty years and more since then, but it will remain one of the unexplained mysteries of the sea."" The party left the table a little later, and left me, an ex-sailor, in a condition of mind not due to the story I had heard from the Commodore. There was something else roused into activity--something indefinite, intangible, elusive, like the sense of recognition that comes to you when you view a new scene that you know you have never seen before. It was nothing pertaining to myself or my adventures; and I had never heard of a ship being found deserted with all boats in place. It was something I must have heard at some time and place that bore no relation to the sea and its mysteries. It tormented me; I worried myself into insomnia that night, thinking about it, but at last fell asleep, and awakened in the morning with a memory twenty-five years old. It is a long stretch of time and space from that gilded restaurant of that night to the arid plans of Arizona, and back through the years of work and struggle and development to the condition of a sailor on shore beating his way, horseback and afoot, across the country from the Gulf to the Pacific. But in my sleep I traversed it, and, lying on my back in the morning, puffing at my first pipe, I lived again my experience with the half-witted tramp whom I had entertained in my camp and who changed his soul in my presence. I was a line-rider for a cattle company, and as it was before the days of wire fences, my work was to ride out each day along my boundary and separate the company's cattle from those of its neighbor, a rival company. It was near the end of the day, when I was almost back to camp, that I saw him coming along the road, with the peculiar swing to his shoulders and arms that, once acquired, never leaves the deep-water sailor; so I had no hesitancy in greeting him after the manner of seamen. ""Well, mate, how are you heading?"" I inquired, as I leaned over the saddle. ""Say, pardner,"" he said, in a soft, whining voice, ""kin you tell me where a feller might git a bite to eat around here?"" ""Well,"" I answered, ""yes and no. I thought you were a sailorman."" Only his seamanly roll had appealed to me. His face, though bearded, tanned, and of strong, hard lines, seemed weak and crafty. He was tall, and strongly built--the kind of man who impresses you at first sight as accustomed to sudden effort of mind and body; yet he cringed under my stare, even as I added, ""Yes, I'll feed you."" I had noticed a blue foul anchor tattooed on his wrist. ""Come along, old man,"" I said, kindly. ""You're traveling for your health. I'll ask no fool questions and say nothing about you. My camp is just around that hill."" He walked beside my horse, and we soon reached the camp, a log house of one room, with an adobe fireplace and chimney, a rough table, and a couple of boxes for seats. Also, there was a plank floor, a novelty and a luxury in that country at that time. Under this floor was a family of huge rats that I had been unable to exterminate, and I had found it easier and cheaper to feed them than to have them gnawing into my stores in my absence. So they had become quite tame, and in the evenings, keeping at a safe distance, however, they would visit me. I had no fear of them, and rather enjoyed their company. I fed and hobbled my horse, then cooked our supper, of which my guest ate voraciously. After supper I filled my pipe and offered him another, but he refused it; he did not smoke. Then I talked with him and found him weak-minded. He knew nothing of consequence, nothing of the sea or of sailors, and he had forgotten when that anchor had been tattooed on his wrist. He thought it had always been there. He was a laborer, a pick-and-shovel man, and this was the only work he aspired to. Disappointed in him, for I had yearned for a little seamanly sympathy and companionship, I finished my smoke in the",0,0.0
"Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG) are a group of rare genetic disorders that affect the glycosylation process, which is the addition of sugar molecules to proteins and lipids. These disorders are characterized by malfunctioning or missing enzymes involved in glycosylation, leading to the impaired production of properly glycosylated molecules. CDG can affect various organs and systems in the body, resulting in a wide range of symptoms and clinical manifestations.

The root cause of CDG is genetic mutations that can be inherited or arise spontaneously. These mutations affect the genes responsible for encoding enzymes involved in the glycosylation process. Currently, over 140 genes have been identified that, when mutated, can cause CDG. The inheritance pattern of CDG can be autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, or X-linked recessive, depending on the specific genetic alteration involved.

The symptoms of CDG can vary greatly, making diagnosis challenging. They can affect multiple organ systems, including the nervous system, gastrointestinal system, and endocrine system. In general, CDG can cause developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, seizures, failure to thrive, liver dysfunction, skeletal abnormalities, and facial dysmorphism. The severity of symptoms can range from mild to severe, and the age of onset can vary from infancy to adulthood.

Based on the affected enzyme and glycosylation pathway, CDG can be classified into different subtypes. The most common classification system used is the one proposed by Jaeken and colleagues, which is based on the defect in the specific step of the glycosylation process. This classification system divides CDG into two main groups: type I and type II.

Type I CDG, also known as the N-glycosylation disorders, involves defects in the assembly or transfer of the sugar molecules onto the protein backbone. This category includes subtypes such as PMM2-CDG, MPI-CDG, and ALG6-CDG. These disorders typically present with more severe symptoms, affecting multiple organ systems.

Type II CDG, also known as the O-glycosylation disorders, involves defects in the attachment of sugar molecules to specific amino acids within proteins. This category includes subtypes such as POMT1-CDG, POMGNT1-CDG, and B4GAT1-CDG. Type II CDG disorders often have milder clinical presentations, although there can still be significant variability in symptoms and severity.

In addition to the N-glycosylation and O-glycosylation disorders, there are other types of CDG that do not fit into these categories. For example, defects in the synthesis or transport of sugar molecules required for glycosylation can lead to disorders such as SLC35A2-CDG and SLC35C1-CDG.

Diagnosis of CDG involves a thorough clinical evaluation, including assessment of the patient's specific symptoms, physical examination, and detailed family history. Laboratory testing plays a crucial role in confirming the diagnosis. This may include biochemical assays, such as measuring the levels of specific sugars or glycoproteins, as well as genetic testing to identify the specific gene mutation causing the disorder.

Unfortunately, there is no cure for CDG. Treatment primarily focuses on managing the symptoms and supporting the affected organs. This may involve a multidisciplinary approach, including physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and specialized medical care. Additionally, targeted therapies, such as enzyme replacement therapy or substrate supplementation, may be available for specific subtypes of CDG.

In summary, Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG) are a group of rare genetic disorders that affect the glycosylation process, resulting in impaired production of properly glycosylated molecules. CDG can have a wide range of symptoms and affect multiple organ systems. The classification system for CDG is based on the specific defect in the glycosylation pathway. While there is currently no cure for CDG, early diagnosis and multidisciplinary management can significantly improve the quality of life for affected individuals.",1,0.0
"Laughter is a universal language that transcends cultural boundaries and connects people from all walks of life. It is a powerful tool that brings people together, creating bonds and fostering a sense of community. Humor, its source, is the essence of our ability to find amusement and joy in the world, no matter how challenging it may be. This interactive art form has been an integral part of human history, dating back to ancient civilizations, where jesters and comedians entertained kings and commoners alike. Today, laughter and humor continue to play a vital role in society, serving as a coping mechanism, a form of entertainment, and a means of social commentary.

The impact of laughter on individuals cannot be overstated. It has been scientifically proven to have numerous physical and mental health benefits. Laughter triggers the release of endorphins, our body's natural feel-good chemicals, which reduce stress and promote a sense of well-being. It boosts our immune system, lowers blood pressure, and even relieves pain. Studies have also shown that laughter enhances our cognitive abilities, improves memory and creativity, and strengthens our social bonds.

Moreover, laughter creates a sense of belonging, uniting individuals by shared positive experiences. Whether it is a family gathering, a comedy show, or a funny anecdote among friends, laughter serves as a social lubricant, easing tension and fostering connection. In a world often divided by differences, humor allows people to let go of their guard, bridge gaps, and find common ground. Comedy clubs and sitcoms provide spaces where people of all backgrounds can come together and laugh, putting aside their differences for a moment and sharing in a collective experience of mirth.

Throughout history, humor has been gifted to society by a multitude of talented individuals known as humorists. These individuals, through their unique perspectives and creative expressions, have carved a niche in the art of laughter. From literary giants like Mark Twain and Oscar Wilde to stand-up comedians like George Carlin and Ellen DeGeneres, humorists have used their wit and words to entertain, challenge societal norms, and offer poignant social commentary.

Mark Twain, one of America's most celebrated humorists, used satire and irony to comment on the social and political issues of his time. His famous works, such as ""The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"" and ""The Innocents Abroad,"" blended humor with insightful observations, exposing the flaws and absurdities of society. Twain's ability to poke fun at human folly and hypocrisy made him a master of laughter and a literary icon.

Oscar Wilde, an Irish playwright and novelist of the late 19th century, was renowned for his witty plays and humorous aphorisms. His works, including ""The Importance of Being Earnest"" and ""Lady Windermere's Fan,"" highlighted the absurdities of Victorian society, challenging its rigid conventions with his biting satire. Wilde's humorous and subversive approach made him a literary trailblazer and a champion of individuality.

In the realm of stand-up comedy, George Carlin stands out as a comic genius who used his sharp wit and dark humor to tackle taboo topics and question societal norms. Carlin's raw and unapologetic style pushed boundaries, making his audience laugh while simultaneously challenging them to reevaluate their perspectives. His legendary routines, such as ""Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television,"" became iconic moments in comedy history.

Ellen DeGeneres, an entertainment powerhouse, has captivated audiences with her relatable humor and infectious charm. Through her stand-up comedy, talk show, and philanthropic work, DeGeneres has embraced the power of laughter to break barriers and promote acceptance. Her ability to find humor in everyday situations has made her a beloved figure, bringing people from different backgrounds together through laughter.

These humorists, and countless others, have not only entertained but also shaped our society by using humor as a form of artistic expression. Their works have challenged norms, sparked conversations, and transformed the art of laughter into a catalyst for change. By showcasing the absurdities of the human condition, humorists have the power to awaken us, make us think, and inspire us to see the world in new and unexpected ways.

In conclusion, laughter and humor are fundamental components of our shared human experience. They bring people together, promoting connection and understanding. The impact of laughter on individuals extends far beyond mere amusement, offering numerous health benefits and fostering a sense of belonging. Humorists, through their creative expressions, have made significant contributions to the art of laughter, pushing boundaries, challenging societal norms, and transforming laughter into a powerful tool for social commentary and change. As we continue to navigate the intricacies of life, let us remember the significance of laughter and embrace its ability to heal, unite, and inspire.",1,0.0
"clock over and over. ""Just like my mother had, when Pete was still alive."" Her eyes sparkled with tears. ""It's made in Germany,"" Larry said. After a moment he added, ""Carl got it for me wholesale. He knows some guy in the clock business. Otherwise I wouldn't have--"" He stopped. Doris made a funny little sound. ""I mean, otherwise I wouldn't have been able to afford it."" He scowled. ""What's the matter with you? You've got your clock, haven't you? Isn't that what you want?"" Doris sat holding onto the clock, her fingers pressed against the brown wood. ""Well,"" Larry said, ""what's the matter?"" He watched in amazement as she leaped up and ran from the room, still clutching the clock. He shook his head. ""Never satisfied. They're all that way. Never get enough."" He sat down at the table and finished his meal. The cuckoo clock was not very large. It was hand-made, however, and there were countless frets on it, little indentations and ornaments scored in the soft wood. Doris sat on the bed drying her eyes and winding the clock. She set the hands by her wristwatch. Presently she carefully moved the hands to two minutes of ten. She carried the clock over to the dresser and propped it up. Then she sat waiting, her hands twisted together in her lap--waiting for the cuckoo to come out, for the hour to strike. As she sat she thought about Larry and what he had said. And what she had said, too, for that matter--not that she could be blamed for any of it. After all, she couldn't keep listening to him forever without defending herself; you had to blow your own trumpet in the world. She touched her handkerchief to her eyes suddenly. Why did he have to say that, about getting it wholesale? Why did he have to spoil it all? If he felt that way he needn't have got it in the first place. She clenched her fists. He was so mean, so damn mean. But she was glad of the little clock sitting there ticking to itself, with its funny grilled edges and the door. Inside the door was the cuckoo, waiting to come out. Was he listening, his head cocked on one side, listening to hear the clock strike so that he would know to come out? Did he sleep between hours? Well, she would soon see him: she could ask him. And she would show the clock to Bob. He would love it; Bob loved old things, even old stamps and buttons. He liked to go with her to the stores. Of course, it was a little _awkward_, but Larry had been staying at the office so much, and that helped. If only Larry didn't call up sometimes to-- There was a whirr. The clock shuddered and all at once the door opened. The cuckoo came out, sliding swiftly. He paused and looked around solemnly, scrutinizing her, the room, the furniture. It was the first time he had seen her, she realized, smiling to herself in pleasure. She stood up, coming toward him shyly. ""Go on,"" she said. ""I'm waiting."" The cuckoo opened his bill. He whirred and chirped, quickly, rhythmically. Then, after a moment of contemplation, he retired. And the door snapped shut. She was delighted. She clapped her hands and spun in a little circle. He was marvelous, perfect! And the way he had looked around, studying her, sizing her up. He liked her; she was certain of it. And she, of course, loved him at once, completely. He was just what she had hoped would come out of the little door. Doris went to the clock. She bent over the little door, her lips close to the wood. ""Do you hear me?"" she whispered. ""I think you're the most wonderful cuckoo in the world."" She paused, embarrassed. ""I hope you'll like it here."" Then she went downstairs again, slowly, her head high. Larry and the cuckoo clock really never got along well from the start. Doris said it was because he didn't wind it right, and it didn't like being only half-wound all the time. Larry turned the job of winding over to her; the cuckoo came out every quarter hour and ran the spring down without remorse, and someone had to be ever after it, winding it up again. Doris did her best, but she forgot a good deal of the time. Then Larry would throw his newspaper down with an elaborate weary motion and stand up. He would go into the dining-room where the clock was mounted on the wall over the fireplace. He would take the clock down and making sure that he had his thumb over the little door, he would wind it up. ""Why do you put your thumb over the door?"" Doris asked once. ""You're supposed to."" She raised an eyebrow. ""Are you sure? I wonder if it isn't that you don't want him to come out while you're standing so close."" ""Why not?"" ""Maybe you're afraid of him."" Larry laughed. He put the clock back on the wall and gingerly removed his thumb. When Doris wasn't looking he examined his thumb. There was still a trace of the nick cut out of the soft part of it. Who--or what--had pecked at him? * * * * * One Saturday morning, when Larry was down at the office working over some important special accounts, Bob Chambers came to the front porch and rang the bell. Doris was taking a quick shower. She dried herself and slipped into her robe. When she opened the door Bob stepped inside, grinning. ""Hi,"" he said, looking around. ""It's all right. Larry's at the office."" ""Fine."" Bob gazed at her slim legs below the hem of the robe. ""How nice you look today."" She laughed. ""Be careful! Maybe I shouldn't let you in after all."" They looked at one another, half amused half frightened. Presently Bob said, ""If you",0,0.0
"It was another exhausting day on Mars. The unyielding red desert stretched out before us, devoid of any signs of life. As I trudged through the barren landscape, kicking up dust with every step, I couldn't help but question our decision to come here. What had possessed us to volunteer for the Geig Corps, to embark on this seemingly impossible mission to search for uranium on the Red Planet? 

The answer was simple, really. Earth's industries were in dire need of a new source of energy. Fossil fuels were becoming scarce, renewable energy sources were struggling to meet the demands, and it seemed that uranium was the only viable solution. So, we made a choice, a sacrifice. We left behind everything we knew and loved, our families and friends, our comfortable lives, and set off on this treacherous adventure. Little did we know just how treacherous it would be.

The Martian environment was harsh and unforgiving, testing our resilience and determination every single day. The scorching sun beat down upon us, unrelenting, and the thin atmosphere offered little protection. The constant struggle for survival left us tired, frustrated, and filled with doubt. But we had to keep pushing forward. Failure was not an option. The weight of Earth's hopes and dreams rested upon our shoulders.

As I glanced over at my partner, who was trudging a few steps ahead of me, I couldn't help but feel a surge of pride. We were in this together, bound by a shared purpose and an unshakeable love. We had faced countless trials and tribulations, but our relationship had only grown stronger. We relied on each other for support, for comfort, in this lonely and desolate world. 

But there were moments, like now, when the weariness seeped into our bones and the doubts crept into our minds. Was it worth it? Were we truly making a difference? As I watched my partner wipe the sweat off their forehead, I could see the exhaustion etched in their face. They had sacrificed so much for this mission, just like I had. And yet, here we were, slogging through the Martian wasteland, uncertain of our success.

A gust of wind swept across the plains, carrying with it the faint scent of iron and the remnants of our dreams. We came to Mars seeking uranium, hoping to bring back a new era of prosperity and progress for Earth. But the reality was so much harsher than we had imagined. The Martian soil seemed barren, devoid of any trace of the precious element we sought. Each day, the sun set over the horizon, casting long shadows upon our weary souls, and we were no closer to our goal.

As the day drew to a close, fatigue weighed heavily upon me. My body ached, my mind yearned for rest. I glanced at my partner, their eyes heavy with exhaustion. Should I wake them? Should we continue our search, fueled by determination and hope? Or should we seize this moment of respite, this fleeting opportunity to simply enjoy each other's company under the Martian sky?

A part of me wanted to wake them, to keep going, to not give up. But another part of me longed for a moment of respite, a reprieve from our arduous journey. Perhaps, in this instance, it was more important to cherish the love and commitment we shared, rather than blindly pursue a goal that seemed increasingly unattainable.

I made my decision. I gently nudged my partner, stirring them from their weary slumber. As they blinked awake, I smiled, wrapping my arms around them. Our eyes met, and in that single moment, we shared a silent understanding. We may not have found uranium today, but we had found something far more precious - the strength to endure, the resilience to face each day, and the love to carry us through this extraordinary journey on Mars.",1,0.0
"As I sit here, contemplating the course of my life, my thoughts inevitably wander back to that pivotal moment - the beginning of a relationship that would shape my future in ways I could never have imagined.

It was a warm summer evening when I first met her. We were both young, full of dreams and aspirations, oblivious to the rollercoaster ride we were about to embark upon. Her name was Emily, and from the moment our eyes met, I felt an inexplicable connection. It was as if fate had intervened to bring us together.

Our love blossomed quickly, fueled by the excitement and anticipation of discovering each other's deepest desires and fears. We spent countless hours exploring quaint coffee shops, taking long walks in the park, and engaging in profound conversations that left us feeling invigorated and alive. I believed we were invincible, that our love would withstand any obstacle thrown our way.

However, as with all great love stories, reality soon settled in. Our relationship was not immune to the trials and tribulations that plagued many couples. Insecurities crept in, doubts started to linger, and our once harmonious connection began to falter. We tried desperately to hold onto what we had, but it seemed that the harder we clung, the more we slipped through each other's fingers.

It was during those moments of uncertainty that I truly discovered the depths of my emotions. The love I felt for Emily was like a double-edged sword, simultaneously bringing me both immense joy and heart-wrenching pain. I found myself questioning my own worth, my ability to make her happy. I became consumed by jealousy, constantly comparing myself to others, afraid that I would lose her to someone better, someone who could give her more.

In the midst of this turmoil, I lost sight of who I was as an individual. My whole identity seemed to revolve around our relationship, leaving little room for self-discovery and personal growth. I had become so consumed by the idea of being in love that I neglected my own passions and aspirations, reducing myself to a mere shadow of who I once was.

And then, like the sudden calm after a storm, came the realization that no relationship could define me. I understood that my happiness should not depend solely on the love of another. It was an epiphany that struck me like lightning, igniting a fire within me to reclaim my own identity and forge a path independent of anyone else.

It was not an easy journey. Breaking free from the shackles of my own insecurities took time and effort. I had to learn to love and value myself, to appreciate my own worth beyond the validation of others. I invested in personal growth, exploring new hobbies, pursuing passions that had long been abandoned. And slowly but steadily, I started to regain a sense of self, a confidence that had been lost amidst the chaos.

Looking back now, years later, I can see the profound impact that relationship had on my life. It was not just a blip in my journey, but a catalyst that forced me to confront my deepest fears, to discover my own strength and resilience. It taught me the importance of self-love, of nurturing one's own dreams and desires alongside the desires of a partner. It taught me that love, though beautiful, should never define one's entire existence.

As I close this chapter of my life, I am grateful for the lessons I learned from that past relationship. It may not have ended in a happily-ever-after, but it shaped me into the person I am today. I carry with me the memories, the heartbreak, and the growth, treasuring them as a testament to my own resilience and ability to overcome obstacles.

And so, I move forward with a renewed sense of purpose, a newfound understanding of love and its complexities. I am no longer defined by the past, but rather, enriched by the experiences that have molded me. As I navigate future relationships, I do so with a sense of self-assuredness, knowing that while love may enhance my life, it does not define it. And for that, I am eternally grateful.",1,0.0
"The 2011 UBS rogue trader scandal caused a loss of over US$2 billion at Swiss bank UBS, as a result of unauthorized trading performed by Kweku Adoboli, a director of the bank's Global Synthetic Equities Trading team in London in early September 2011.[1][2] On 24 September 2011, Oswald Grübel, the CEO of UBS, resigned ""to assume responsibility for the recent unauthorized trading incident"", according to a memo to UBS staff.[3][4] On 5 October Francois Gouws and Yassine Bouhara, the co-heads of Global Equities at UBS, also resigned.[5] It later emerged that UBS had failed to act on a warning issued by its computer system about Adoboli's trading.[6][7][8] After two delays requested by Adoboli and a change of legal representation, Adoboli pleaded not guilty to two counts each of fraud and false accounting on 30 January 2012. He was released on conditional bail after a bail application at Southwark Crown Court on 8 June 2012. He was later convicted of both counts of fraud and sentenced to seven years imprisonment. He appealed against both conviction and sentence.[9] On 15 September 2011, Adoboli was arrested under suspicion of fraud in connection with a loss of a then-estimated US$2 billion, reportedly due to unauthorized trading at the Swiss group's investment bank. A spokesperson from the Swiss banking regulator FINMA referred to the case as one of the biggest ever seen at a Swiss bank.[1] Adoboli had originally retained the law firm of Kingsley Napley, which previously advised Nick Leeson.[10] However, he has now changed his legal representation to Bark & Co and Furnival Chambers, with the fees being paid by legal aid.[11] On 30 January 2012 he pleaded not guilty to two charges of fraud and two charges of false accounting and faced up to 10 years in prison if convicted of all charges.[12] The loss to UBS was described as ""manageable"" although it might cause UBS to report a net loss in the following financial quarter. The bank's net earnings for the year ending June 2011 were $6.4 billion[13] with a gross profit of approximately $1.1 billion reported by UBS for the third quarter of 2011.[14][15] On 15 September, the day of Adoboli's arrest, the price of the stock of UBS closed down 10.8%, while the price of other European bank stocks rose between 3–6%.[16] It has been reported that Adoboli informed UBS of his unauthorized trades, and then the bank informed the Financial Services Authority and the police.[17] On 16 September, it was announced that City of London Police charged Adoboli with fraud by abuse of position and false accounting.[18] On 18 September 2011, UBS issued a statement which revealed the losses from the alleged unauthorized trading stood at $2.3 billion. The rogue trader reportedly racked up the losses by speculating on EuroStoxx, DAX and S&P 500 indexes.[19] The prosecutor in Adoboli's trial, Sasha Wass, stated that Adoboli ""was a gamble or two from destroying Switzerland's largest bank for his own benefit.""[20] According to Business Insurance, as in the case of the unauthorized trades by Nick Leeson at the Singapore office of Barings Bank, the Adoboli incident took place at a location away from the bank's central office, where the risk management systems are typically stronger.[21] Kweku Adoboli was born 21 May 1980.[22] His family home was in Tema, Ghana, but he has lived in the UK since 1991 and been described as ""British by culture, citizenry and fame.""[23] He graduated from the University of Nottingham, where he studied computer science and management, in 2003.[1] Prior to this, he studied at Ackworth School (a Quaker-run private boarding school near Leeds), where he was Head Boy between 1997 and 1998, the year he graduated.[24] According to the Daily Telegraph, shortly before the news of the incident broke, Adoboli had posted on his Facebook account that ""I need a miracle"".[25] Kweku's father, John Adoboli, is a former Ghanaian official at the United Nations. On the day of his son's arrest, he expressed the family's shock and disbelief: ""We are all here reading all the materials and all the things being said about him. The family is heartbroken because fraud is not our way of life.""[26] According to UBS, Adoboli had disguised the risk of his trades by using ""forward-settling"" ETF cash positions.[27] According to the Financial Times, and other sources, Adoboli is suspected to have used the fact that some ETF transactions in Europe are not issued confirmations until after settlement has taken place.[2] The exploitation of this process allows a party in a transaction to receive payment for a trade before the transaction has been confirmed.[28] While the cash proceeds in this scheme cannot be simply retrieved, the seller may still show the cash on their books and possibly use it in further transactions.[28] The process of orchestrating fails to deliver trades may then be used in a carousel of transactions.[28][29] Unlike in the United States, no data about the volume of fails-to-delivers is available for Europe.[28][30] CNN and World Finance also stated that some banks have deliberately allowed certain levels of fails-to-deliver, as a method of ""dealing with financial stress"" so that between accounting cycles the value of securities sold, but not delivered, as well as the value of the cash booked, but not received can be reflected on the books.[28][29][31] In October 2011, Sergio Ermotti, the then-interim CEO of UBS, after the departure of Grübel, admitted that the computer system at UBS had detected the unauthorized trading activities of Adoboli beforehand and had issued a warning, but the bank had failed to act on the warning.[6][7][8] In May 2012, Sergio Ermotti, Group CEO, spoke at the UBS AGM about the changes implemented following the scandal. Ermotti spoke of improved internal monitoring and deficiencies in the financial reporting control system that have been addressed. Ermotti also made reference to employees that have been replaced or had pay docked due to serious mistakes or unreasonable behaviour.[32] On 24 September 2011 Oswald Grübel, the CEO of UBS resigned ""to assume responsibility for the",0,0.0

Is that how the fourth dimension works?"" ""It's the only time when the stellar currents permit the trip back to Earth. And it's _not_ the fourth dimension!

""You're his old friend from college days, handled his financial affairs, and helped him raise enough money to build his machine?"" ""Yes,"" Stern replied, a little pompously. ""It was through my efforts that several wealthy men took an interest in the machine, so that Dr. Curtis did not have to bear the entire expense himself."" ""Yeah, yeah,"" the reporter sighed. ""I read an old story on it before I came here. Now I'm out of cigarettes."" He looked hopefully at Stern. Stern returned the look coldly. ""There's a store where you can buy some about three blocks down the road."" ""Is that the room where he's expected to materialize with his machine?"" The reporter pointed to an inner door. ""Yes. Dr. Curtis wanted to be sure no one would be injured. This inner circular room was built first; then he had the outer wall put up as an added precaution. The circular passageway we're in leads all around the old room, but this doorway is the only entrance."" ""And what are those holes in the top of the door for?"" ""If he returns, we can tell by the displaced air rushing out. Then the door will open automatically."" ""And when is the return scheduled for?"" asked the reporter. ""Three-forty-seven and twenty-nine seconds."" ""If it happens,"" the reporter added skeptically. ""And if it doesn't, we have to wait another year."" ""Optimum conditions occur just once a year."" ""Well, I'm going out to get some cigarettes. I've got time ... and probably nothing to wait for. I'll return though."" He walked briskly through the outer door. * * * * * ""This is the hardest part of the year, especially now. Suppose he did come back,"" Beryl said plaintively.

Stern opened his gold case now and offered Beryl a cigarette. She shook her head. ""But he made two trial runs in it first and came back."" ""That was for a short distance only--that is, a short distance astronomically. Figuring for Mars was another story. Maybe he missed the planet and ..."" ""Oh, don't! It's just not _knowing_ that I can't stand."" ""Well,"" he said drily, ""we'll know in--"" he stopped and looked at his wristwatch--""in just about fifteen minutes."" ""I can't wait,"" she moaned. He put his arm around her. ""Relax. Take it easy and stop worrying. It'll just be like last time."" ""Not the last time at all. We hadn't--"" ""As soon as we are able to leave here,"" he said, drawing her close and squeezing her gently, ""I'll take steps to have him declared legally dead. Then we'll get married."" ""That's not much of a proposal,"" she smiled. ""But I guess I'll have to accept you. You have Clyde's power of attorney."" ""And we'll be rich. Richer than ever. I'll be able to use some of my own ideas about the investments. As a matter of fact, I have already."" And he frowned slightly. ""We have enough,"" Beryl said quickly. ""Don't try to speculate. You know how Clyde felt about that."" ""But he spent so damned much on the machine. I had to make back those expenses somehow."" Steps sounded outside and they drew apart. The reporter came in with a companion of about his own age. ""Better wipe the lipstick off,"" he grinned. ""It's almost time for something to happen."" Stern dabbed at his mouth angrily with his handkerchief. At first the sound was so soft that it could hardly be heard, but soon a whistling grew until it became a threat to the eardrums. The reporters looked at each other with glad, excited eyes. The whistling stopped abruptly and, slowly, the door opened. The reporters rushed in immediately. Beryl gripped Stern's hand convulsively. ""He's come back."" ""Yes, but that mustn't change our plans, Beryl dear."" ""But, Al ... Oh, why were we so foolish?"" ""Not foolish, dear. Not at all foolish. Now we have to go in."" Inside the room was the large sphere of metalloy. It had lost its original gleam and was stained and battered, standing silent, closed, enigmatic. ""Where's the door?"" called the first reporter. The sphere rested on a number of metal stilts, reaching out from the lower hemisphere, which held it about three feet from the floor, like a great pincushion turned upside down. Slowly, a round section of the sphere's wall swung outward and steps descended. As they touched the floor, both reporters, caught by the same idea, sprinted for it and fought to see which would climb it first. ""Wait!"" shouted Stern. The reporters stopped their scuffling and followed Stern's gaze. * * * * * Something old and leathery and horrible was emerging from the circular doorway. Several tentacles, like so many snakes, slid around the hand rail which ran down the steps. Then, at the top, it paused. Stern felt an immediate and unreasoning hate for the thing, whatever it was, a hate so strong that he forgot to feel fear. It seemed to him to combine the repulsive qualities of a spider and a toad.

"that. It's putting together what my boy assures me is some kind of talking machine, and any minute now it's going to start communicating. It's been twenty minutes since I notified Washington on this thing. It won't be long before somebody back there decides this is top secret and slaps a freeze on us here that will make the Manhattan Project look like a publicity campaign.

We'll put Willow Grove on the map bigger'n Cape Canaveral ever was."" ""We're with you on that, Carter!"" Ten minutes after the melodious voice of the Fianna's translator had requested escort to the village headman, the visitor was looking over the crowded courtroom with an expression reminiscent of a St. Bernard puppy hoping for a romp. The rustle of feet and throat-clearing subsided and the speaker began: ""People of the Green World, happy the cycle--"" Heads turned at the clump of feet coming down the side aisle; a heavy-torsoed man of middle age, bald, wearing a khaki shirt and trousers and rimless glasses and with a dark leather holster slapping his hip at each step, cleared the end of the front row of seats, planted himself, feet apart, yanked a heavy nickel-plated .44 revolver from the holster, took aim and fired five shots into the body of the Fianna at a range of ten feet. The violet form whipped convulsively, writhed from the bench to the floor with a sound like a wet fire hose being dropped, uttered a gasping twitter, and lay still. The gunman turned, dropped the pistol, threw up his hands, and called: ""Sheriff Hoskins, I'm puttin' myself in yer pertective custody."" * * * * * There was a moment of stunned silence; then a rush of spectators for the alien. The sheriff's three-hundred-and-nine-pound bulk bellied through the shouting mob to take up a stand before the khaki-clad man. ""I always knew you was a mean one, Cecil Stump,"" he said, unlimbering handcuffs, ""ever since I seen you makin' up them ground-glass baits for Joe Potter's dog. But I never thought I'd see you turn to cold-blooded murder."" He waved at the bystanders. ""Clear a path through here; I'm takin' my prisoner over to the jail."" ""Jest a dad-blamed minute, Sheriff."" Stump's face was pale, his glasses were gone and one khaki shoulder strap dangled--but what was almost a grin twisted one meaty cheek. He hid his hands behind his back, leaned away from the cuffs. ""I don't like that word 'prisoner'. I ast you fer pertection. And better look out who you go throwin' that word 'murder' off at, too. I ain't murdered nobody."" The sheriff blinked, turned to roar, ""How's the victim, Doc?"" A small gray head rose from bending over the limp form of the Fianna. ""Deader'n a mackerel, Sheriff."" ""I guess that's it. Let's go, Cecil."" ""What's the charge?"" ""First degree murder."" ""Who'd I murder?"" ""Why, you killed this here ... this stranger."" ""That ain't no stranger. That's a varmint. Murder's got to do with killin' humerns, way I understand it. You goin' to tell me that thing's humern?"" Ten people shouted at once: ""--human as I am!"" ""--intelligent being!"" ""--tell me you can simply kill--"" ""--must be some kind of law--"" The sheriff raised his hands, his jowls drawn down in a scowl. ""What about it, Judge Gates? Any law against Cecil Stump killing the ... uh...?"" The judge thrust out his lower lip. ""Well, let's see,"" he began. ""Technically--"" ""Good Lord!"" someone blurted. ""You mean the laws on murder don't define what constitutes--I mean, what--"" ""What a humern is?"" Stump snorted. ""Whatever it says, it sure-bob don't include no purple worms. That's a varmint, pure and simple. Ain't no different killin' it than any other critter."" ""Then, by God, we'll get him for malicious damage,"" a man called. ""Or hunting without a license--out of season!"" ""--carrying concealed weapons!"" Stump went for his hip pocket, fumbled out a fat, shapeless wallet, extracted a thumbed rectangle of folded paper, offered it. ""I'm a licensed exterminator. Got a permit to carry the gun, too. I ain't broken no law."" He grinned openly now. ""Jest doin' my job, Sheriff. And at no charge to the county."" * * * * * A smaller man with bristly red hair flared his nostrils at Stump. ""You blood-thirsty idiot!"" He raised a fist and shook it. ""We'll be a national disgrace--worse than Little Rock! Lynching's too good for you!"" ""Hold on there, Weinstein,"" the sheriff cut in. ""Let's not go gettin' no lynch talk started."" ""Lynch, is it!"" Cecil Stump bellowed, his face suddenly red. ""Why, I done a favor for every man here! Now you listen to me! What is that thing over there?"" He jerked a blunt thumb toward the judicial bench. ""It's some kind of critter from Mars or someplace--you know that as well as me! And what's it here for? It ain't for the good of the likes of you and me, I can tell you that. It's them or us. And this time, by God, we got in the first lick!"" ""Why you ... you ... hate-monger!""

"had hung perplexed and a little fearful for so many generations, the man who pressed the button that has changed peace and warfare and well-nigh every condition of human life and happiness. Never has that recurring wonder of the littleness of the scientific man in the face of the greatness of his science found such an amazing exemplification. Much concerning Filmer is, and must remain, profoundly obscure--Filmers attract no Boswells--but the essential facts and the concluding scene are clear enough, and there are letters, and notes, and casual allusions to piece the whole together. And this is the story one makes, putting this thing with that, of Filmer's life and death. The first authentic trace of Filmer on the page of history is a document in which he applies for admission as a paid student in physics to the Government laboratories at South Kensington, and therein he describes himself as the son of a “military bootmaker” (“cobbler” in the vulgar tongue) of Dover, and lists his various examination proofs of a high proficiency in chemistry and mathematics. With a certain want of dignity he seeks to enhance these attainments by a profession of poverty and disadvantages, and he writes of the laboratory as the “gaol” of his ambitions, a slip which reinforces his claim to have devoted himself exclusively to the exact sciences. The document is endorsed in a manner that shows Filmer was admitted to this coveted opportunity; but until quite recently no traces of his success in the Government institution could be found. It has now, however, been shown that in spite of his professed zeal for research, Filmer, before he had held this scholarship a year, was tempted, by the possibility of a small increase in his immediate income, to abandon it in order to become one of the nine-pence-an-hour computers employed by a well-known Professor in his vicarious conduct of those extensive researches of his in solar physics--researches which are still a matter of perplexity to astronomers. Afterwards, for the space of seven years, save for the pass lists of the London University, in which he is seen to climb slowly to a double first class B.Sc., in mathematics and chemistry, there is no evidence of how Filmer passed his life. No one knows how or where he lived, though it seems highly probable that he continued to support himself by teaching while he prosecuted the studies necessary for this distinction. And then, oddly enough, one finds him mentioned in the correspondence of Arthur Hicks, the poet. “You remember Filmer,” Hicks writes to his friend Vance; “well, HE hasn't altered a bit, the same hostile mumble and the nasty chin--how CAN a man contrive to be always three days from shaving?--and a sort of furtive air of being engaged in sneaking in front of one; even his coat and that frayed collar of his show no further signs of the passing years. He was writing in the library and I sat down beside him in the name of God's charity, whereupon he deliberately insulted me by covering up his memoranda. It seems he has some brilliant research on hand that he suspects me of all people--with a Bodley Booklet a-printing!--of stealing. He has taken remarkable honours at the University--he went through them with a sort of hasty slobber, as though he feared I might interrupt him before he had told me all--and he spoke of taking his D.Sc. as one might speak of taking a cab. And he asked what I was doing--with a sort of comparative accent, and his arm was spread nervously, positively a protecting arm, over the paper that hid the precious idea--his one hopeful idea. “'Poetry,' he said, 'Poetry. And what do you profess to teach in it, Hicks?' “The thing's a Provincial professorling in the very act of budding, and I thank the Lord devoutly that but for the precious gift of indolence I also might have gone this way to D.Sc. and destruction...” A curious little vignette that I am inclined to think caught Filmer in or near the very birth of his discovery. Hicks was wrong in anticipating a provincial professorship for Filmer. Our next glimpse of him is lecturing on “rubber and rubber substitutes,” to the Society of Arts--he had become manager to a great plastic-substance manufactory--and at that time, it is now known, he was a member of the Aeronautical Society, albeit he contributed nothing to the discussions of that body, preferring no doubt to mature his great conception without external assistance. And within two years of that paper before the Society of Arts he was hastily taking out a number of patents and proclaiming in various undignified ways the completion of the divergent inquiries which made his flying machine possible. The first definite statement to that effect appeared in a halfpenny evening paper through the agency of a man who lodged in the same house with Filmer. His final haste after his long laborious secret patience seems to have been due to a needless panic, Bootle, the notorious American scientific quack, having made an announcement that Filmer interpreted wrongly as an anticipation of his idea. Now what precisely was Filmer's idea? Really a very simple one. Before his time the pursuit of aeronautics had taken two divergent lines, and had developed on the one hand balloons--large apparatus lighter than air, easy in ascent, and comparatively safe in descent, but floating helplessly before any breeze that took them; and on the other, flying machines that flew only in theory--vast flat structures heavier than air, propelled and kept up by heavy engines and for the most part smashing at the first descent. But, neglecting the fact that the inevitable final collapse rendered them impossible, the weight of the flying machines gave them this theoretical advantage, that they could go through the air against a wind, a necessary condition if aerial navigation was to have any practical value. It is Filmer's particular merit that he perceived the way in",0,0.0
"1. Mary Brown's Centre, formerly known as Mile One Centre, is an indoor arena and entertainment venue located in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. It opened its doors to the public on May 29, 2001. The construction of the arena was a joint effort between the City of St. John's and the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador.

The naming rights for the venue were initially secured by Mile One Limited, a local consortium. However, in November 2017, the popular Newfoundland and Labrador-based restaurant chain, Mary Brown's, acquired the naming rights, resulting in the current name change to Mary Brown's Centre.

Over the years, Mary Brown's Centre has played host to a variety of major tenants. From 2001 to 2005, the St. John's Maple Leafs, an American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate of the Toronto Maple Leafs, called the arena home. Their presence brought a new level of professional hockey to the city.

2. In 2005, the St. John's Maple Leafs relocated to Toronto, marking the end of the AHL's presence in St. John's. However, the void left behind was quickly filled by the arrival of the St. John's Fog Devils. The Fog Devils were a Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) expansion team and played their home games at Mile One Centre from 2005 to 2008.

Unfortunately, the Fog Devils were not able to establish a strong fan base and faced financial difficulties. As a result, the team was relocated to Montreal, Quebec, and became the Montreal Junior Hockey Club in 2008.

3. In 2011, professional hockey returned to St. John's with the arrival of the St. John's IceCaps. The IceCaps were the AHL affiliate of the Winnipeg Jets and played their home games at Mile One Centre from 2011 to 2015. The team quickly gained a passionate following and brought the excitement of AHL hockey back to the city.

After four successful seasons, the IceCaps faced uncertainty due to the Winnipeg Jets' desire to move their AHL affiliate closer to home. As a result, the IceCaps were relocated to Winnipeg, Manitoba, in 2015 and became the Manitoba Moose.

4. Following the departure of the St. John's IceCaps, the Hamilton Bulldogs temporarily relocated to St. John's for the 2015-2016 AHL season. During their time in St. John's, the team was renamed the St. John's IceCaps to maintain continuity with the previous AHL team in the city.

This move was necessary as the Montreal Canadiens, the Bulldogs' NHL affiliate, purchased the Hamilton Bulldogs and relocated them to St. John's to bridge the gap in professional hockey until a permanent AHL team could be established in Laval, Quebec.

The St. John's IceCaps played their final season in 2016-2017 before officially relocating to Laval and becoming the Laval Rocket.

5. The arrival of the Newfoundland Growlers in 2018 brought professional hockey back to St. John's. The Growlers are an expansion team in the ECHL (formerly East Coast Hockey League) and became the primary tenant of Mary Brown's Centre. In their inaugural season, the Growlers achieved great success, winning the Kelly Cup Championship.

However, their tenure at Mile One Centre faced a temporary hiccup when a dispute over lease terms led to their eviction from the arena in 2020. The team was forced to temporarily relocate to Toronto for the 2020-2021 season due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

6. In addition to professional hockey, Mary Brown's Centre has also seen the introduction of professional basketball to St. John's. The St. John's Edge, a team in the National Basketball League of Canada (NBLC), joined the league in 2017 and played their home games at Mile One Centre.

However, the Edge faced financial challenges, and their lease was terminated in 2020. Following their departure, the St. John's Lions, an American Basketball Association (ABA) franchise, briefly filled the professional basketball void in the city.

7. Mary Brown's Centre has also been a popular venue for various sporting events and concerts. Notable events include the 2014 AHL All-Star Game, which showcased the top talent in the AHL, as well as the Juno Awards, Canada's premier music awards, in 2002 and 2010. The arena has also hosted the Tim Hortons Brier, the Canadian men's curling championship.

8. Since its opening in 2001, Mary Brown's Centre has proven to be a versatile entertainment venue, hosting a wide range of events. In addition to professional hockey and basketball, the arena has been utilized for concerts, trade shows, conventions, and community events.

The venue's versatile seating configuration allows for various capacities depending on the event. It can accommodate up to 7,500 spectators for hockey games and concerts, making it the largest indoor arena in Newfoundland and Labrador.

Furthermore, the arena's central location in St. John's makes it easily accessible to residents and visitors alike. The venue has played a crucial role in enhancing the cultural and entertainment landscape of the city, providing a platform for both local and international events.",1,0.0
"Judge Anderson took a deep breath as he entered the courtroom, preparing himself for yet another day of legal proceedings. As an aging judge, he had spent decades presiding over various cases, witnessing the ebb and flow of justice firsthand. But today, as he settled into his chair behind the bench, his mind was occupied by a different matter altogether - the encroaching influence of technology in the legal system.

The rise of cybernetic units, capable of sifting through extensive amounts of data and rendering legal judgments, had become a topic of much debate among legal professionals. These advanced machines had the potential to analyze cases swiftly and impartially, removing the inherent biases that often clouded human judgment. Yet, Judge Anderson couldn't help but feel a sense of unease at the prospect of a future without human judges.

As the proceedings began, Judge Anderson observed the attorneys briskly presenting their arguments, their voices competing with the low hum of technology in the background. Witness after witness stepped forward, their testimonies analyzed and scrutinized by the court's digital assistants. The judge couldn't help but marvel at the efficiency with which these machines processed information, rapidly synthesizing evidence and providing suggestions for the case's outcome.

Just as he began to surrender to the idea that technology could indeed revolutionize the legal system, the defense attorney made a startling accusation. He claimed that the cybernetic unit involved in the analysis of the case had a programming error, potentially skewing the evidence against his client. The courtroom held its breath as the claim reverberated through the room, casting doubt on the reliability of the machine's assessment.

Judge Anderson's heart sank. This accusation highlighted the very issue that had been troubling him. While technology was capable of processing vast amounts of information, it was still prone to errors and vulnerabilities. How could he, as a judge, continue to place blind trust in machines when they too were subject to fallibility?

As the defense attorney continued to present his case, Judge Anderson's mind raced to find a solution. He couldn't ignore the potential benefits that technology provided, but he also couldn't turn a blind eye to its limitations. The courtroom drama unfolded before him, but his focus remained on the dilemma he faced.

In the midst of the proceedings, Judge Anderson made a decision that would alter the course of the trial. He called for a recess, requesting a meeting with the defense and prosecution attorneys. Together, they discussed the concerns surrounding the cybernetic unit's programming and formulated a plan. They decided to bring in an independent expert to examine the machine and verify the accuracy of its analysis.

During the recess, Judge Anderson found himself reflecting on the importance of balance. While technology could assist judges and streamline the legal process, it should not replace the human element entirely. Machines could provide valuable insights, but ultimately, it was the judge's responsibility to weigh the evidence, consider the arguments, and deliver a just verdict.

When the trial resumed, Judge Anderson addressed the court, acknowledging the potential benefits that technology offered but also highlighting its limitations. He emphasized the importance of human judgment in rendering fair decisions and explained the steps taken to address the programming error in the cybernetic unit. The court listened intently, sensing the weight of this pivotal moment.

As the trial continued, Judge Anderson carefully considered the evidence, questioning witnesses, and dissecting arguments. The independent expert's analysis ultimately confirmed the accuracy of the machine's assessment, reaffirming the potential of technology in the legal system. However, Judge Anderson also scrutinized the defense's claims, ensuring that mistrust in technology did not overshadow a fair trial.

In the end, Judge Anderson delivered his verdict, basing it not solely on the analysis of the cybernetic unit, but on his own interpretation of the evidence and the law. The courtroom drama came to a close, leaving behind a lingering debate about the role of technology in the legal system. Judge Anderson knew that the issue would continue to be a pressing concern for future judges as the boundaries of justice continued to evolve.

As he left the courtroom that day, Judge Anderson couldn't help but feel a renewed sense of purpose. He was determined to navigate the changing landscape of justice, ensuring that technology served as an aid to human judgment rather than a replacement for it. The rise of cybernetic units might be inevitable, but the delicate balance between technology and human wisdom would always be essential for a truly just legal system.",1,0.0
"Investigating Directorate: Serious Economic Offences and Others v Hyundai Motor Distributors (Pty) Ltd and Others; In Re Hyundai Motor Distributors (Pty) Ltd and Others v Smit NO and Others,[1] an important case in South African law, was heard in the Constitutional Court on March 16, 2000, with judgment handed down on August 25. Chaskalson P, Langa DP, Goldstone J, Kriegler J, Madala J, Mokgoro J, Ngcobo J, O'Regan J, Sachs J, Yacoob J and Cameron AJ were the judges. A search warrant had been issued in terms of section 29 of the National Prosecuting Authority Act[2] in respect of certain premises. A large quantity of documents, records and data was seized from those premises. The respondents applied to a High Court for an order declaring, inter alia, sections 28(13), 28(14) and 29(5) of that Act to be inconsistent with the Constitution. The High Court granted the order to the extent that those sections authorised the search and seizure of property where there were no reasonable grounds for suspecting that a specified offence had been committed. In an application for the confirmation of the order and an appeal to the Constitutional Court against that order, the court held that the right to privacy, as guaranteed in the Constitution,[3] did not relate solely to the individual within his or her intimate space. When persons moved beyond this established ""intimate core,"" they still retained a right to privacy in the social capacities in which they acted. Thus, when people were in their offices, in their cars or on mobile telephones, they still retained a right to be left alone by the State unless certain conditions were satisfied. The right to privacy would come into play when a person had the ability to decide what to disclose to the public and when the decision was reasonable.[4] The court held, further, that juristic persons enjoyed the right to privacy, although not to the same extent as natural persons. The level of justification for any particular limitation of the right would have to be judged in the light of the circumstances of each case. Relevant circumstances would have included whether the subject of the limitation was a natural or a juristic person, as well as the nature and effect of the invasion of privacy.[5] Although judicial officers had to prefer interpretations of legislation that fell within constitutional bounds over those that did not, provided that such an interpretation could be reasonably ascribed to the provision, limits had to be placed on the application of that principle. On the one hand, it was the duty of a judicial officer to interpret legislation in conformity with the Constitution insofar as this was reasonably possible; on the other hand, the legislature was under a duty to pass legislation that was reasonably clear and precise, enabling citizens and officials to understand what was expected of them. A balance would often have to be struck as to how this tension was to be resolved when considering the constitutionality of legislation. There would be occasions when a judicial officer would find that the legislation, although open to a meaning which would be unconstitutional, was reasonably capable of being read in conformity with the Constitution. Such an interpretation should not, however, be unduly strained. Where a legislative provision was reasonably capable of a meaning that placed it within constitutional bounds, it should be preserved. Only if this was not possible should resort be had to the remedy of reading in or notional severance.[6][7] A preparatory investigation in terms of s 28(13) was a procedure that was available to an investigating director who had insufficient grounds or information to form a reasonable suspicion that a specified offence had been committed: A mere suspicion could have triggered a preparatory investigation in terms of s 28(13), provided the purpose was to enable the investigating director to decide whether or not there were in fact reasonable grounds for a suspicion that a specified offence had been or was being committed.[8] The court found that the investigating directorate was a special unit established under the Act to conduct investigations into serious and complex offences. If it had been unable to commence investigations until it had a reasonable suspicion that a specified offence had been committed, initial investigations, which may have been sensitive and crucial, would have been beyond its jurisdiction. The provisions of the Act authorising the investigating directorate to engage in preparatory investigations served the purpose of enabling the investigating directorate to be involved in sensitive investigations from an early stage. The purpose, therefore, was to assist the investigating director in crossing the threshold from a mere suspicion that a specified offence had been committed to a reasonable suspicion, which was a prerequisite for the holding of an inquiry. A suspicion, short of a reasonable suspicion that a specified offence had been committed, could have arisen either because there was uncertainty as to whether an offence had been committed, or because there was uncertainty that an offence in respect of which there was reasonable suspicion was in fact a specified offence.[9] The court held, further, that it was also implicit in the legislation that the judicial officer should have had regard to the provisions of the Constitution in making the decision. The Act quite clearly exhibited a concern for the constitutional rights of persons subjected to the search and seizure provisions. That was the apparent reason for the requirement in sections 29(4) and (5) that a search and seizure be carried out only if sanctioned by a warrant issued by a judicial officer. In the light of the law of criminal procedure, the legislative history and the specific provisions of section 29(2) of the Act, the legislature had to be taken to have contemplated that a judicial officer would not have exercised a discretion to issue a warrant if that would have resulted in an impermissible violation of the right to privacy of the persons to be searched.[10][11] A search warrant could properly be obtained, on the",0,0.0

It is performed without staging or costumes and is similar to an opera in its use of chorus, soloists, and orchestral accompaniment. However, unlike opera, oratorios are primarily focused on the music and the storytelling rather than visual spectacle.

The term ""oratorio"" comes from the Italian word ""oratorio,"" meaning ""prayer hall."" It originated during the Renaissance era as a form of musical prayer or contemplation. The earliest recorded oratorio was composed by Emilio de' Cavalieri in the late 16th century, but it wasn't until the Baroque period that the genre gained prominence.

During the Baroque era, oratorios were performed in churches or oratories and were often associated with religious celebrations or events. They were used as a means of conveying biblical narratives to the audience. The most famous composer of baroque oratorios was George Frideric Handel, with his masterpiece ""Messiah"" being one of the most well-known oratorios to this day.

Oratorios were typically divided into two parts, similar to operas. The first part would present the narrative, while the second part would focus on reflection and interpretation. The music in oratorios was often highly ornate, with intricate choruses, arias, and recitatives. The chorus played a significant role in oratorios, providing commentary, narration, and reflecting the emotions of the characters.

As the Baroque era transitioned into the Classical period, oratorios gradually declined in popularity, largely due to the rise of opera as the dominant musical form. However, oratorios continued to be composed and performed, albeit on a smaller scale. The works of composers such as Joseph Haydn and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart showcased the evolution of the oratorio during this time.

In the 19th century, oratorios experienced a revival, thanks to composers such as Felix Mendelssohn. They began to incorporate elements of operatic techniques and symphonic writing, creating a more dramatic and emotional experience. Mendelssohn's oratorio ""Elijah"" is considered one of the finest examples of this period.

In the 20th century, oratorios saw further diversification. Composers experimented with different musical styles and incorporated elements of folk music, jazz, and even atonality. Benjamin Britten's ""War Requiem"" and Leonard Bernstein's ""Mass"" are notable examples of the modern oratorio.

Today, oratorios continue to be performed and appreciated worldwide. While they are still primarily associated with religious and sacred themes, contemporary composers have explored new subjects, including historical events, social issues, and political commentary. Oratorios provide a unique musical experience, combining the power of choral singing, solo performances, and orchestral grandeur to convey narratives that resonate with audiences.",1,0.0
"The Cry of Jazz is a 1959 documentary film by Edward O. Bland that connects jazz to African American history.[1] It uses footage of Chicago's black neighborhoods, performances by Sun Ra, John Gilmore, and Julian Priester and the music of Sun Ra and Paul Severson interspersed with scenes of musicians and intellectuals, both black and white, conversing at a jazz club. It has been credited as being an early example of the Black pride movement and with predicting the urban riots of the 1960s and 1970s, and has been called the first hip-hop film.[2][3] In 2010, this film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"".[4] The Library of Congress had this to say of the film and its significance: Cry of Jazz...is now recognized as an early and influential example of African-American independent filmmaking. Director Ed Bland, with the help of more than 60 volunteer crew members, intercuts scenes of life in Chicago’s black neighborhoods with interviews of interracial artists and intellectuals. Cry of Jazz argues that black life in America shares a structural identity with jazz music. With performance clips by the jazz composer, bandleader and pianist Sun Ra and his Arkestra, the film demonstrates the unifying tension between rehearsed and improvised jazz. Cry of Jazz is a historic and fascinating film that comments on racism and the appropriation of jazz by those who fail to understand its artistic and cultural origins.[5] The Cry of Jazz is set in Chicago at the meeting of a jazz appreciation club of musicians and intellectuals, both Black and White. It is broken up into seven parts. Parts one, three, five, and seven center around conversations among the jazz club members. Parts two, four, and six are done in a documentary style and utilize footage of life in Chicago as well as of Sun Ra's band performing the music. Alex, the film's main character, serves as narrator during these sections.[2] Although the film is nominally about jazz, jazz is used primarily as a metaphor to understand the African American experience.[6] As the majority of the attendees of the jazz club leave, the crowd that remains is composed of two White men, Bruce and John, two White women, Natalie and Faye, and three Black men, Alex, Louis, and Bob. Alex overhears Bruce telling Natalie that rock and roll is jazz, which prompts a discussion about what jazz is. When Bruce asserts ""jazz is merely the Negro's cry of joy and suffering,"" the White characters protest, upset with Bruce's implication that only Black people could have created jazz. Alex elaborates on Bruce's point, explaining ""the Negro was the only one with the necessary musical and human history to create jazz."" Alex makes a direct comparison between the structure of jazz and the Black experience in the United States. Jazz plays over shots of Black neighborhoods of Chicago, an attempt to demonstrate the affinity between jazz and Black life. Alex continues to explain jazz as the ""triumph of the Negro spirit"" over the difficulties Black people face in a racist America. He links the restrictive form and changes of jazz to this limitation and suffering, and improvisation to an expression of joy and freedom within a restrictive society. Alex also argues that the sound of jazz reflects the ""characteristic atmosphere, color, and sensuality"" of Black life, just as the sound of jazz played by Whites reflects White life. Bruce and Natalie again express confusion with the claim that Blacks see America differently than Whites. Alex responds that Black people see America in a unique way because they have never been fully included in American society yet have found ways to survive. Alex and Louis then assert that slavery and continued racism constitute an erasure of the past, present, and future of Black people in America and that, through music, Black people have created a record of their history. Alex traces the history of jazz, including New Orleans jazz, swing, be-bop, and cool jazz. Footage of Sun Ra's band playing examples of each style accompanies the description of each type of jazz. A discussion arises concerning what it would take to achieve racial equality in America. From Alex and Louis's perspective, America must come to celebrate the story of joy and suffering told through jazz because it is a story that transcends national and ethnic boundaries. When Natalie then asks about the future of jazz, Alex claims that jazz is dead, startling all the characters. In Alex's opinion, jazz is dead because the form and the changes of jazz cannot evolve, and any alteration to the form and changes of jazz would not result in jazz. Alex claims that therefore, because jazz cannot grow, it is dead. While Alex asserts that this ""jazz body"" is dead, he maintains that the ""spirit of jazz"" is alive. He goes on to express that the ""jazz body"", which contains the restraining elements of jazz, must die because the social restraints on Black people in America must end. The White characters continue to contest the death of jazz. Alex suggests that the ""spirit of jazz"" will give rise to a new form of music. When Bruce then asks how Whites fit into this story, Louis and Alex proclaim that what happens to Black people in America concerns Whites because it implicates their morality and humanity. The film ends with Alex's assertion that the world's perceptions of the United States will depend on American society's treatment of black people. In the early to mid 1950s the composer Edward Bland, novelist Mark Kennedy, city-planner Nelam Hill, and mathematician Eugene Titus conceived the idea for The Cry of Jazz. Together they formed KHTB Productions, which took its name from the first letter of each person's last name. It took several years for them to write the script, and several more to make the film itself. Bland assumed the role of director while maintaining his job as a postal",0,0.0
"Aaron Coleman (born September 20, 2000) is an American politician. A Democrat, he was the Kansas House Representative for the 37th district. The district covers the Turner neighborhood and parts of the Argentine and Armourdale neighborhoods of Kansas City in Wyandotte County, Kansas.[2] He was first elected in 2020 at the age of 20. Coleman has been accused of engaging in abusive and harassing behavior on a series of occasions.[3][4] He has admitted to and apologized for childhood acts of online bullying, blackmail, and revenge porn.[5][6] He was arrested twice in late 2021. Following Coleman's 2021 arrests, many members of his own party—including Governor Laura Kelly—called for his resignation. Conversely, Republican House members refused to take more severe action, blocking efforts to expel Coleman. Republican John Barker said the legislature would set a precedent if it removed Coleman from office for acts he had committed prior to his election.[7] Coleman was suspended from the state Democratic party in February 2022 for two years due to his continuing misconduct.[8] Following allegations of domestic violence, Coleman lost his re-election bid; he was defeated in a landslide by Melissa Oropeza in the 2022 Democratic primary.[9] Coleman lives in Kansas City, Kansas with his family.[10][11] He has worked as a dishwasher.[12] As of 2020, Coleman attended Johnson County Community College.[1] He is Jewish.[13] In 2017, as a seventeen-year-old who had dropped out of high school, Coleman entered the race for governor of Kansas as a write-in independent candidate ahead of the 2018 election.[14] Democrat Laura Kelly won the election.[15] In 2019, Coleman ran for the board of public utilities in Kansas City, Kansas.[16] In 2020, Coleman defeated seven-term incumbent Stan Frownfelter in a Democratic primary in Kansas House of Representatives District 37. The victory was considered an upset.[17] Coleman, then 19 years of age, won by just 14 votes.[5] After Coleman admitted to online bullying, blackmail and revenge porn, Frownfelter announced he would run a write-in campaign against Coleman.[18][19] Coleman initially dropped out of the race, but later reversed his decision.[20] Democratic House Minority Leader Tom Sawyer, supported Frownfelter's write-in campaign, as did Democratic Governor Laura Kelly.[18] Another candidate, Kristina Smith, a paralegal and treasurer of the Wyandotte County Republican Party, also pursued a write-in campaign.[21] The Kansas Young Democrats endorsed Frownfelter and condemned Coleman.[22] In August 2020, Coleman told former Republican state lawmaker John Whitmer that he would ""laugh and giggle when you get COVID and die"".[23][24] Coleman claimed Whitmer was repeating anti-mask “conspiracy theories”.[24] Coleman ran on a platform of women's rights (specifically, access to contraceptives and abortion services, as well as equal pay), tuition-free public college, defunding the police, Medicare for all, legalizing cannabis, and the Green New Deal.[25][23] Coleman won the general election to the Kansas House of Representatives on November 3, 2020[26] at the age of 20.[27] In November 2020, Coleman tweeted that he would ""call out a hit"" on Kansas Governor Laura Kelly, and predicted she would face an ""extremely bloody"" Democratic primary in 2022.[28] Coleman said that his tweet was not a call for physical violence against the governor,[29] but an expression of his belief that Kelly's moderate political positions did not appeal to him or the party's left wing; he self-identifies as a democratic socialist.[30] In response, Sawyer and state Democratic chair Vicki Hiatt stated that Democrats in the House would file a complaint against Coleman when he was sworn in and work for the two-thirds vote required to remove him from office.[28] Seven recently elected female Democratic state legislators signed a December 21, 2020, letter calling on Coleman to resign before taking office.[31] On December 31, 2020, Sawyer denied Coleman any committee seat assignments in the incoming legislature.[32] On January 13, 2021, two days after being sworn in to the Kansas House of Representatives, Coleman announced he had left the Democratic Party and would sit as an independent.[33] On February 8, he re-joined the Democrats.[34] Coleman had also threatened Sawyer. The chair of the committee investigating Coleman, Republican John Barker, said, ""I don't want to set a precedent."" Republican Kristey Williams, commented on the opposition to Coleman's removal, ""I think this is a good compromise,"" (the avoidance of a House vote on expulsion).[35] Skeptical Democratic committee members, unpersuaded by Coleman's testimony, wanted stronger action.[35] Shawnee Democratic Representative Cindy Neighbor, shared her concerns that there was a repeated pattern of behavior that could continue to pose security threats for members. ""Something has to be done because otherwise this is a slap in the face of those who are his victims — and they are victims....So whatever we do has to have strong accountability measures.""[35] Following the hearing, Sawyer characterized Republican's action as ""essentially...a reprimand,"" and expressed disappointment at the lack of stronger discipline.[35] Sawyer also said his former chief of staff, Heather Scanlon, had been threatened by Coleman.[35] In February 2021, the Select Investigating Committee of the Kansas House of Representatives sent Coleman a letter of warning and admonition in regard to past conduct unbecoming of a state legislator.[36][37] Following Coleman's October 2021 arrest on domestic violence charges, Sawyer called Coleman's more recent arrest ""extremely disturbing news"" and said Coleman should ""resign and get the help he badly needs.""[38] After Coleman was arrested again in November 2021, for allegedly driving under the influence of alcohol, Sawyer again requested Coleman's resignation, as did Kelly. She called for the legislature to expel Coleman if he did not voluntarily leave office.[39][40] A complaint was filed seeking Coleman's removal from office.[37] Coleman ran for re-election to the Kansas House of Representatives in 2022.[9] He faced two primary challengers and finished in a distant third with just 13.1% of the vote.[9] Melissa Oropeza, a nurse practitioner, won the Democratic primary with 49.2% of the vote.[9] After his 2020 Kansas House primary victory, Coleman's past history generated significant controversy, leading to him admitting that he had leaked revenge porn in middle school when he was 12.[27] He has also admitted to bullying, extortion, and threats of physical violence at his middle school.[41]",0,0.0
"urlLink Blowfish urlLink The Simpsons: ""One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish"" Here is a translation that I made from urlLink this german text about blowfishs : New Cadelonia, 7th September 1774. Mistrustfully reserved natives are observing the spanking foreign ships which landed in the silent bay of the natives´ southern paradise. The strangely bright skinned invaders didn´t augur well. Captain Cook, who was to return from the southern ice pack border to New Zealand during his second worldtrip, leaned at the concretive railing of his ""Resolution"" with the flag of Great Britain and ordered to load the boats with gifts. The 7th September should become an unfortunate day for navigator and discoverer Cook as well as for two co-travelling scientists. Towards evening the boats docked back, and the sailors delivered Captain Cook a silver Toado , a mighty blowfish, as a gift of the natives. As it turned out later, it was a Spheroides sceleratus whose extreme poisonousness was well-known to the inhabitants of the island. Probably one man uttered doubts at the fish´s edibility. Cook however quickly brushed theworries aside with the clue that he ate the same fish in Australia without any harm and that he tasted good. Prepared in the right way, this fish is in deed a true palatal pleasure that lets the hearts of gourmets beat faster just at the sight of the fish. But the cook, who was more accustomed to the preparation of native herrings, obviously didn´t know about that because he calculated served the men liver and ovarion of the blowfish, that is his organs containing aside from the residual intestines and the gonads the heaviest fish toxin in general, Tetrotodoxin (TTX). Each of the three men received just a small amount, a sample quasi.... It started harmless. A creep on the lips, after a few minutes also at the fingers and several toes. Hours later the men laid down, far gone. Feelings of numbness on the whole body, incorporated with a feeling of floatation, martyring pains in the chest, frightening muscle infirmity that soon crossed over into paralysises of arms and legs. The men survived, rather due to a good whimsy of mother nature, since a blowfish contamination ends lethally with aprobability of 60%. A pig that ate from the residual intestines was found dead the next day. Equally John Buff who stood on the ""Duck River Bridge"" (Parramatta near Sydney) in the afternoon of the 18th April 1821 and watched at the peaceful picture of a sunday fisher. He fried the caught blowfishs on a grill. The meal shoudln´t do him well. The report of the physician and mortician showed the following: 10 minutes after the meal he felt a numb feeling allaround his body. His tongue swelled and he complained about being really thirsty. Weak and strenghtless he laid himselfon the floor. After he had drunken some water, he asked, paralysized on his arms and legs, to be turned onto the other side. This was John Buff´s last request before his good soul disappeared into eternity. From the first morsel up to his death only 20 minutes had passed by. Blowfish contaminations were feared even in ancient times. In the grave of Pharao Ti, 2700 BC, there was the picture of a Tetraodeon stellatus , which was named ""spt"" or ""shepet"" by the old Egypts. This means baneful or toxic. Also the OldTestament offers us a clue: ""That´s it what you may eat of all that lives in the sea. Everything which has flappers and scales, you may eat. But what has no flappers and scales, you must not eat, it should be considered impure to you. - Deuteronomium 14, 9-10. Blowfishs have a skin that feels tender and sleek, with just tiny scales and abortive flappers.The fish appeared to the Olds as scaleless. Blowfishs live in the tropes and subtropics. Only a few of them dare to enter the temperate zones. Some also succeeded in adapting to the freshwater, and they live in rivers now. Even the Mediterrean Sea knows a blowfish type, which is calledTetraodeon fineatus and whose poisonousness is unavowed. About 50 of the 1000 living sorts are known as toxical. Contaminations happen all around the world, but in Japan they are most frequent. There they are considered to be a delicacy for centuries. The Japanese call it ""fugu"" and their mouth waters when thinking of this tickling meal. Who survives has to pay the devil. Relishing Fugu is like Russian Roulettes: You never know whether the served fish is really nontoxic. The following numberscan demonstrate this forcefully: In the years 1956 to 1958 there were 715 contaminations in Japan, thereof 420 with lethaloutgoing. Which is 60% thus. This rate is nearly typical for blowfish contaminations. In the course of the last years this percentage has declined clearly however as well as the total number of contaminations.This is not due to the sudden fear of the Japanese but to the whole opposite. It is rather the government that restricts the preparation of Fugu to licensed cooks. They learn in courses how to flay the very sinewed skin, which contains toxin sometimes, in the most considerate way. Then, how the toxical organs look (ovarians or testicles, liver, gallbladder and gut) and how to remove without the slightest infraction. For instance, when you cut off the gallbladder, then the TTX canseep into the flesh and cause contaminations. An American professor who held lectures at the University of Tokyo for a long time explained to me after a dive in the Caribbean (we just discovered a blowfish) with lighting eyes: ""You know, it is the toxin that providesthe condiment, it gives you every palatal pleasure that no steak in the world can offer you."" And in deed, in Japan the most contaminations are reported in midwinter, thus before the fishs´ spawn periode which startsin spring. Before spawning there is a higher gonad activity (increased hormone production) leading to a higher production of TTX which then is stored in",0,0.0
"Yeah I know, it's kinda like human nature for girls to be bitchy to eachother. But at some point, you go TOO FAR. Like with all the happenings of this week. I can really understand Emily being mad because she THOUGHT I was talking crap about her, but then I can't understand why on earth she would go say the stuff she said, even if I HAD been talking about her. Which I wasn't. Yes yes yes, it was my fault for telling her and Christy, and I know it was wrong. But I can honestly say that I the only reason that I told them was because I never, in a million and one years, thought that it would leave Emily's kitchen. Which just sucks now because I know I can't trust anyone. Atleast anyone that gets drunk and then talks about stuff they shouldn't be. UGH! And this whole summer I have been constantly dealing with the whole ""I know that what Christian is doing isn't right, but I really love him and so I'll over look it."" And its kinda to the point now where I dont think about it as much. But you know what the funny thing is? Christian is so much more funny, so much sweeter, and more attractive, and more sexy to me when he's completely sober. And when he calls me at God knows what time of night, and he's drunk hanging out with his friends, well good for him. But I don't have to pretend that I like talking to him like that. Cause I don't. And as much as it kills me to say it, I'm getting so tired of it. It's like ALL him and his friends do. Like when do they ever get together and just hang out and not get drunk? NEVER! Maybe I'm the werido who can hang out with my friends and not have to be drinking (or smoking weed for that matter) and still have fun. But it seems to me that most of the drama associated with mine and Christian's relationship revolves around whom he was getting drunk with and what happened while they were drunk. As was the case with him and jackie when he cheated on me. As was the case when Emily told jackie all that stuff she shouldn't have. UGH! Maybe I'm like the odd ball. Cause when i get drunk, I never start drama. Its always about having fun and hanging out. Never about talking shit about people, or making out with random people... Whatever. Tomorrow, me and Melanie are going shopping (thank God for finally getting paid), and then I have to pack and what-not for the family vacation. Oddly enough I'm kidna excited. For one thing it'll be kinda cool to see everyone again. Two Nick will be there, WITHOUT Kristina which, these days, is pretty amazing. Three we havn't had a vacation in over a year. So it should prove to be fun. Today was pretty boring. I got up (finally) at like 1 and Christian came over and then at like 3 we went to lunch. I had to be at work at 5 and then after work (like 1045) me and Theo and Christy and Sam went to Chilli's and then to Walmart. OK WEIRD. In wal-mart, me and christy are walking to the bathroom and she goes ""Hey whit isn't that Danny V. from work?"" and I'm like NO WAY and so we walk over all non-chalant pretending to go to the ""bathroom"" and walk right by him. AND IT'S HIM. This wouldn't be that weird if him and Christian weren't like all close and stuff. Anyways, so 1. I see one of Christian's friends. Then we're walking to the restroom for real this time, and I do a double take cause I thought (might not have bene though I was pretty sure) I saw Christian's brother's wife. WERID!!!!! THEN (OH THERE'S MORE) Me and Theo and Christy are over in the CD's and we're walking down the middle isle and I look over and walking out of one of the side isles is CHRISTIANS MOM!! AHHHH!!!! It was like they were all out to get me. hahaha!! So yeah that was weird. I was kinda angry tonight cause Christian said that me and him were gonna hang out after i got done at work, and then at like 8 he called Old Navy and told me that his friend marc was leaving to go back to school (naval Academy) on Saturday so his friend Jorge was having a party for him at his house. So Christian went there. Which in reality was fine cause I know that he could see me any day of the week and Marc is leaving so it made sense for him to hang out with them. I dunno, i was just being stupid. Anyways so I was kinda mad and so i didn't call him when i got outa work and then he called me at like midnight and the radio in my car was up too loud and i didnt hear it. So when i got home i called him back and he was over at the partay with his friends. He sounded drunk (typical) and it just annoyed me. So he was being gay talking about how they were all gonna call Jackie and make her feel bad and stuff. Whatever. It was kinda stupid cause he was just drunk-talking. Lame. He said he call me back, which was fine casue anything that he was saying to me at this point was just bullshit and in-sincere. And I didnt really feel like dealing with it. Or listening to it for that matter. Well, he just called me and I didn't answer. I don't wanna listen to him say stupid stuff like ""Baby I love you."", ""Baby I miss you so much."", ""baby I wish I was with you right now."". It's all just so",0,0.0
"As a friend of mine is want to say, ""Goddamn!"" it has been a while my friends. I do apologize, but my life has been going through many changes of late. For those who may not know I graduated, I am moving to Hawai'i and I have developed a third nipple. ... Wait scratch that last one. After graduation, my numero uno partner in crime and all things shady, and I decided to take a little road trip. I thought it would be a nice start to the blogging season (I'm working full time now until I leave for Biloxi, Mississippi) to share with you my journal entries from the road trip to end all road trips. Disclaimer: The contents of this journal were events that occurred usually after vast consumption of alcohol. If the event described was done sober, there is also a fair chance it was recorded while under the influence of spirits and as such, all entries must be taken with a grain of salt. That being said... enjoy! Day 1: Well we're off. Marco and I on the open road. First stop his parents house. God we're such pussy's. Can't even start a road trip without hitting up are 'rents for food. Day 2: We just left Clevland and the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame... ehh? The girls at Gloria Jean's Coffee liked Marco's rendition of Michelle Branch. Everyone in Cleveland is either really, really, REALLY nice or just gay... I can't decide. 5:16 PM EST - We just left Notre Dame... great soap in their bathrooms, truly the mark of a spectacular university. Day 3: Today we hit up Chicago. ""Hey look, there's that building over there."" Good one Marco... truly staggering the intellect we're exerting on this trip. Whoever said the top of the Sears Tower was a good place to pick up chicks is full of shaite. The Hancock Building ""Big John"" was our first stop. Why did they name a building Big John that also has ""cock"" in it's name is a mystery to me? Is no one in Chicago as immature as me to see the jokes that can be made out of this one? The public library was nice, but we could have done with out the smelly dreads dude. There's always gotta be one... damn Rastifarians! Tonight we're going to paint the town red... or white, whatever works. Day 4: So do you have one of those ""I came to Chicago and decided to break up with my girlfriend and move to Hawai'i"" gifts? No? Okay I guess a thermos will do. So last night the Gap ""guy"" told us to go to ""Hogs Hunnies"", but guess what? They aren't open till Wednesday, silly fagget. Remember not to take advice from guys hitting on you from behind the Gap counter... guess it's time to find a new stock broker then... damn it. So back to our night, it ended up okay because we then found a bar called ""North Beach"" and met Jean. Drink One: We took our Chaser pills, Marco's face is numb and I'm losing function of my legs. We decide to play pool. Games 1 2 go to Marco... is that dance really necessary buddy? Drink Two: We're getting louder. Marco starts throwing quarters around. Our flirting with Jean and the African Princess is escalating. Holy Shaite, Jean actually does know all the lyrics to REM's ""It's the End of the World""... I'm going to marry this woman. Goddamn these drinks are good (20 ozs of Jack and Coke baby!) Game 3 mine, Marco took Game 4... Okay Stripes, you rule. Time to go. We take a cab to Division Street. Drink Three: Bootleggers gives us our third drink for three. They're hurting for business tonight. We need food, stat! Some pizza joint, whatever... freakin' ass at this point would suffice. ""We should go to a bar that's got some food... you know... like bar food."" Brilliant Cha... brilliant. George W. reads quotes from me and says ""Man even I don't sound that stupid..."" No bar food here, pizza will do. Drink Four: She-nannigans... this place is dead. We attempt to buy two homely looking girls drinks end up offending the 400 lb bartender. Time to go! Drink Five: Mother's Too is the bar. 2nd round of Chaser pills. Some talkative slowmo is hitting on me, I think Marco is getting jealous. We decide to hustle this one pool table. ""The one's a insert slur here , so you know he likes to bet!"" I can never run for president... ever. Drink Six: We crank call an old acquaintance of Marco Mine... BONG!!! Queer guy still talking politics... time to go! Cab ride to strip club, the freaking place is closing early. We're left with no choices at this point... Escort Services. Chicago... great town... expensive hookers. (Should be a bumper sticker or something...) $300 per hour, per girl??? F'dat! Time for a smoke to clear our heads. Hold up... two sisters on a road trip heading east outside of our hotel smoking... Thank you God!!! Cherish you are so ours... oh yeah... good night to you too. Tease. Marco asks the concierge where we can get some ""escorts"" (read here as ""Where's the red light district?"") He doesn't seemed nearly as amused as we are... f' him. Blig-a-dee-blam... we're out. Day 5: Following morning, Operation Get Out of Paying $60 for Parking fails despite a marvelous performance by Marco with his new Bohemian friend. Over pancakes and bacon we overhear a disgusting conversation. Marco fake throws up offends some bitch. Are we still drunk? It's been a blast Chicago, but I think it's about time we head back east. We've got about 14 hours of driving to do today, let's roll! Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and about half of Pennsylvania go by okay, then we met Trooper Lhf.

"As I stood at the entrance of the grand abandoned palace, my heart swelled with anticipation. The doors, once imposing and regal, now creaked open as if inviting me into a world frozen in time. The air was thick with the scent of dust and decay, a poignant reminder of the years that had passed since this place had last seen life.

I walked through the halls, my footsteps echoing off the marble floors with each step. The silence was broken only by the occasional scurrying of small creatures, making this journey feel like an expedition into the forgotten. It was as if the palace itself held its breath, waiting for someone like me to unravel its secrets.

And then, I saw him—a frail, old man with a long white beard, sitting on a worn-out armchair near a cracked window. He seemed to belong to this place, his presence seamlessly blending with the faded grandeur of the palace. With a twinkle in his eyes, he beckoned me closer.

""Welcome, young one,"" he rasped, his voice carrying the weight of time. ""You have found your way to an extraordinary chronicle of forgotten dreams.""

I couldn't help but be captivated by his words. It was as if he held the key to unraveling the mysteries that lay within these dilapidated walls. I approached him cautiously, my curiosity piqued.

""I was the caretaker of this palace once,"" he continued, his voice laced with nostalgia. ""The Duke and Duchess who resided here were the epitome of opulence and majesty. They hosted lavish parties and gathered the finest minds and artists of their time. But alas, those days are long gone now.""

He paused, lost in his memories, and then motioned for me to follow him. As we navigated the labyrinthine hallways, he pointed out intricate carvings on the walls, faded frescoes that whispered tales of grandeur, and chandeliers that dangled precariously from the high ceilings.

Each room we entered was like stepping into a different era. In the grand ballroom, with its crystal chandeliers and splendid mirrors, I could almost hear the sound of laughter and music, mingling with the rustle of silk gowns. The dining hall, with its long banquet table and ornate silverware, evoked images of extravagant feasts and lively conversation.

Yet, it was in the private chambers that I could truly feel the presence of the Duke and Duchess. The walls adorned with oil paintings, depicting their opulent life with unrivaled precision. A portrait of a young Duchess, her eyes ablaze with a sense of purpose, stared back at me from across the room. Her grace and beauty were captured in exquisite detail, a testament to the artist's skill.

The old man's words broke the spell. ""These paintings, my young friend, are the relics of a world long forgotten. A world where power and passion intertwine, where art and opulence merge into a symphony of grandeur.""

As we ventured deeper into the palace, the atmosphere changed. The rooms became more modest, simpler, hinting at a gradual decline. The once vibrant colors on the walls faded, their glory obscured by layers of dust and neglect. It was a melancholic reminder that time spares no one, not even those who once commanded the admiration of an entire kingdom.

Finally, we reached a room shrouded in darkness. Only a sliver of light pierced through a broken window, illuminating a forgotten masterpiece. A statue of the Duke, regal and immortalized in marble, stood in the center. The sculptor had captured the essence of the Duke's character, his stern posture conveying authority and strength. But his eyes, oh, his eyes held a hint of sadness, as if he longed for the days of grandeur that were now lost to time.

As I took in the sight before me, a profound sense of longing washed over me. I yearned to witness this palace in its prime, to be a part of the stories whispered through its corridors. But alas, all that remained were fragments of a forgotten past.

With a heavy heart, I turned to the old man, who had silently observed my every reaction. His eyes were filled with understanding, as if he had witnessed this bittersweet pilgrimage countless times before.

""This place, this palace, is a testament to the ephemeral nature of power and beauty. It is a reminder that even grandeur can crumble, that time takes everything but memories. Cherish these moments, young one, for they hold the key to unlocking the stories that live within these walls.""

As I left the abandoned palace, its doors closing behind me with a solemn finality, I couldn't help but feel a mix of sadness and wonder. The echoes of the Duke and Duchess's lives lingered in my mind, their legacy preserved in the faded grandeur of their home.

As I walked away, I couldn't help but wonder about the countless other abandoned palaces around the world, each with its own history waiting to be uncovered. And in the end, I realized that it is through exploring these forgotten realms that we not only learn about the past but also gain insight into our own fleeting existence.",1,0.0
"Network entropy is a fundamental concept in network science that captures the degree of disorder or uncertainty in a network's structure or dynamics. It provides insights into the complexity and randomness of networks, and plays a crucial role in understanding the behavior and robustness of various networked systems.

In information theory, the Shannon entropy is a widely used measure of uncertainty or information content in a dataset. It has been extended to networks to quantify the randomness in the connectivity patterns. The Shannon entropy of a network is defined based on the probability distribution of node degrees, which represents the likelihood of encountering a node with a given degree in the network. A higher entropy value indicates higher randomness or disorder in the network topology.

However, there are limitations to the Shannon entropy when applied to networks. It assumes that node degrees follow a discrete probability distribution, which may not be accurate for all types of networks. Additionally, the Shannon entropy only captures the degree distribution of a network and does not consider other important network characteristics such as the clustering coefficient or community structure.

To address these limitations, other formulations of network entropy have been proposed. One such formulation is based on algorithmic complexity, which measures the minimum number of bits required to describe the network structure. The algorithmic complexity of a network takes into account the global connectivity patterns and captures the intrinsic complexity and compressibility of the network. However, computing the algorithmic complexity is a challenging task, as it requires solving a computationally hard problem known as the minimum description length.

Another approach to measure network entropy is based on the concept of random walkers. Random walkers are virtual particles that move across a network by taking random steps from one node to another. The entropy of a network can be estimated by measuring the randomness or uncertainty in the trajectory of random walkers. Random walkers tend to spend more time in regions of the network with higher connectivity, and their trajectory provides insights into the structure and navigability of the network.

Apart from these formulations, an alternative measure of network entropy known as the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy has been proposed. It is based on the concept of dynamical systems and captures the rate of information production or loss along the trajectories of particles moving on the network. The Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy provides a more comprehensive measure of network complexity by considering both the topological structure and the dynamical behavior of the network.

The concept of network entropy is closely related to the robustness of networks. A network with low entropy and high regularity tends to be more vulnerable to failures or attacks, as slight changes in its structure can have a significant impact on its functionality. On the other hand, a network with high entropy and high complexity can exhibit higher resilience and adaptability to changes, as it possesses a rich set of alternative paths and redundant connections. Understanding network entropy can, therefore, help in designing and optimizing robust network architectures.

Furthermore, network entropy has connections to other metrics and concepts in network science. For example, recent research has shown a link between network entropy and Ricci curvature, a measure of curvature within a network. Network entropy provides insights into the smoothness or heterogeneity of the geometric properties of a network, which is closely related to its curvature. Additionally, network entropy has connections to the von Neumann entropy, a measure of uncertainty in quantum systems. The application of quantum information theory to network science has led to new perspectives on measuring and understanding network entropy.

In conclusion, network entropy is a vital concept in network science that characterizes the randomness, disorder, and complexity of networks. Various formulations, such as the Shannon entropy, algorithmic complexity, random walkers, and the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy, have been proposed to measure network entropy. Understanding network entropy provides insights into the robustness and behavior of networks, and its connections to other metrics further enhance our understanding of complex networked systems.",1,0.0
"A sawshark or saw shark is a member of a shark order (Pristiophoriformes /prɪstiˈɒfɒrɪfɔːrmiːz/) bearing a unique long, saw-like rostrum (snout or bill) edged with sharp teeth, which they use to slash and disable their prey. There are eight species within the Pristiophoriformes, including the longnose or common sawshark (Pristiophorus cirratus), shortnose sawshark (Pristiophorus nudipinnis), Japanese sawshark (Pristiophorus japonicas), Bahamas sawshark (Pristiophorus schroederi), sixgill sawshark (Pliotrema warreni), African dwarf sawshark (Pristiophorus nancyae), Lana's sawshark (Pristiophorus lanae) and the tropical sawshark (Pristiophorus delicatus).[2] Sawsharks are found in many areas around the world, most commonly in waters from the Indian Ocean to the southern Pacific Ocean. They are normally found at depths around 40–100 m, but can be found much lower in tropical regions. The Bahamas sawshark was discovered in deeper waters (640 m to 915 m) of the northwestern Caribbean. Sawsharks have a pair of long barbels about halfway along the snout. They have two dorsal fins, but lack anal fins.[3] Genus Pliotrema has six gill slits, and Pristiophorus the more usual five. The teeth of the saw typically alternate between large and small. Saw sharks reach a length of up to 5 feet and a weight of 18.7 pounds, with females tending to be slightly larger than males.[4] The body of a longnose saw shark is covered in tiny placoid scales: modified teeth covered in hard enamel.[5] The body is a yellow-brown color which is sometimes covered in dark spots or blotches. This coloration allows the saw shark to easily blend with the sandy ocean floor.[6] These sharks typically feed on small fish, squid, and crustaceans, depending on species. The function of the sawshark barbels are not well understood,[7] and neither is how they use their rostrum. It is possible they use it in a similar fashion as sawfishes, and hit prey with side-to-side swipes of the saw, crippling them. The saw could also be utilized against other predators in defense. The saw is covered with specialized sensory organs (ampullae of Lorenzini) which detect an electric field which is given off by buried prey.[8] Saw sharks life history is still poorly understood. Mating season occurs seasonally in coastal areas. Saw sharks are ovoviviparous meaning eggs hatch inside the mother. They have litters of 3–22 pups every 2 years. After 12 months of pregnancy, the pups are born at 30 cm long. While in the mother, pups' rostral teeth are angled backwards to avoid harming the mother. The life expectancy of sawsharks is still poorly understood, but they are thought to live to 10 years or more.[9] Among the different species of sawshark, all are listed on the IUCN Red List of 2017 as either data deficient or of least concern[10] Saw sharks do not see much human interaction because of their deep habitats. There are currently ten known species of sawsharks across two genera in this family: The sixgill sawshark (Pliotrema warreni) is known for its six pairs of gills located on its sides close to the head. They are pale brown in color, with a white underbelly. Along with their color, their size sets them apart from the other types of sawfish: The females are around 136 cm where the males are around 112 cm. Sixgill sawsharks feed on shrimp, squid and bony fish. They are located around the southern portion of South Africa, and Madagascar. Where found, they are considered a prize catch.[12] They dwell in the rage of 37–500 m, preferring to stay in the warmer water. They have between 5 and 7 pups from 7–17 eggs. They have these young in the range of 37–50 m deep to make sure the pups are warm.[13] The longnose sawshark aka the common sawshark (Pristiophorus cirratus) is one of 9 species within the family Pristiophoridae.[14] It has unique physical characteristics which include a long, thin, and flattened snout. Midway down the snout, nasal barbels protrude on both sides of the snout.[15] Near the barbels, the longnose sawshark possesses a pair of ampullae of Lorenzini. It is unique among the sawshark family by having a longer snout than any of its counter species.[15] The longnose sawshark is not very large with lengths ranging from around 14 inches at birth to 38 inches in males and 44 inches in females.[16] They can also grow to a weight of 18.7 pounds.[17] They are known to swim in the waters off the southern coast of Australia's continental shelf. They can also be found in the eastern portion of the Indian Ocean.[15] The longnose sawshark prefers to swim in both the open sea and coastal regions from the surface to a depth of 600m.[18] The longnose Sawshark is known to mainly prey on small crustaceans.[19] It uses its barbels to detect prey on the ocean floor which it then hits with its snout to immobilize it.[16] Like all other sawsharks, the common sawshark has a long snout with rows of small teeth and barbels on either side. It has five gill slits on either side of its head and between 19 and 25 teeth on each side.[20] Sawsharks appear to be one of the types of elasmobranch that are difficult or impossible to age using most commonly-used approaches that rely on vertebral banding.[21] The shortnose sawshark aka the southern sawshark (Pristiophorus nudipinnis) is found in south-eastern Australian waters. Much of its distribution overlaps with that of the Common sawshark, however, it seems to occur less frequently.[22] This species is similar in size as the common sawshark, but has a broader rostrum (saw) and a more even brown coloration. It also grows to be heavier than the common sawshark.[23] Since the color pattern of the common sawshark may be more or less defined, the easiest way to separate this species from the common sawshark is the location of the barbels, which are closer to the mouth than the co-occurring common sawshark. Unlike the common sawshark, the southern sawshark likely feeds mainly on fishes.[19] The tropical sawshark (Pristiophorus delicatus) a pale brown with a yellow hue,",0,0.0
"So let me tell you about my online dating mishaps. It's like entering a virtual jungle filled with strange creatures and wild adventures. One minute, you're swiping left and right, the next minute, you're caught in a conversation mishap that leaves you scratching your head. It's a hilarious and sometimes painful journey, my friend.

Firstly, let's talk about the art of online communication. You need a certain level of finesse to navigate through the sea of profiles and find your potential match. But let me tell you, I learned that not everyone is a wordsmith when it comes to online dating.

There was this one guy I matched with on a popular dating site. Everything seemed great at first. We had similar interests, views on life, and even shared a favorite TV show. But as we started talking, I quickly realized that his communication style was... let's say, less than stellar. His messages were a jumbled mess of acronyms, emojis, and random ellipses. It was like deciphering an ancient hieroglyphic code.

I tried my best to keep up with his abbreviated language, but it felt like I was trying to solve a puzzle in a foreign language. Texting him was like cracking the Da Vinci Code, except instead of finding hidden treasure, I was just trying to find a coherent sentence. Needless to say, our ""conversation"" fizzled out faster than a soda left open for too long.

Then there was the guy who seemed to have a fetish for using outdated pickup lines. I mean, seriously, who still uses lines like ""Is your dad a baker? Because you're a cutie pie."" It's like he traveled back in time to the 1950s and thought it was still a thing. I couldn't help but laugh at his attempts, but it didn't exactly make me swoon.

But my personal favorite mishap has to be the guy who seemed like a real charmer in his profile. We had great banter going on, making jokes about our favorite movies and TV shows. It was all going so well until he dropped a bombshell. He confessed his undying love for a particular character from Game of Thrones. Now, don't get me wrong, I love a good fantasy series as much as the next person, but this guy took it to a whole new level.

He went on a lengthy rant about how this character was the epitome of perfection and how he had a shrine dedicated to her in his basement. My initial reaction was, ""Run! Don't walk, run!"" Who knew that online dating could unearth such peculiar obsessions?

Now, we all know that online dating has its fair share of catfishes. You know, those people who create fake profiles and pretend to be someone they're not. I had my fair share of encounters with these elusive creatures. One time, I matched with this seemingly attractive person who claimed to be a millionaire business owner living in a mansion. Well, I should have known better.

After exchanging a few messages, the truth came out. They were not a millionaire, but an unemployed couch potato living in their parents' basement. And that mansion they mentioned? It was just a poster they had stuck on their bedroom wall. Talk about a disappointment.

But amid all the mishaps, there were a few shining moments of online dating humor. I once matched with someone who had the wittiest responses to every question I asked. It was like having my own personal stand-up comedian in my pocket. We laughed our way through our conversations, and it was refreshing to find someone who could make me smile even through a digital screen.

Online dating may be a rollercoaster ride of mishaps and adventures, but it's also an opportunity to connect with people in a digital age. Sure, there will be communication hiccups and encounters with interesting characters, but that's what makes it all the more entertaining.

So, if you're brave enough to take the plunge into the world of online dating, buckle up and prepare for a wild ride. Just remember, keep your sense of humor intact, and you might just find yourself a diamond in the rough. Or at the very least, a good story to share at parties.",1,-1.0
"The Alchemy of Fermentation First the definition of alchemy which is useful here: Alchemy (AL KEM E); The medieval and Renaissance precursor to modern chemistry, characterized by mystical philosophy and attempts to turn ""base"" metals such as lead and tin into ""noble"" metals such as gold and silver. The tenets of alchemy were based on the theory of the four elements (see elements, the four), in which all matter was composed of varying proportions of four substances--air, earth, water, and fire. Chaucer's ""Canon Yeoman's Tale"" focuses on the deceptions of false alchemical practitioners, and Shakespeare's The Tempest borrows heavily from alchemical lore in its depiction of the island's magical spirits. The only difference between turning lead into gold and grape into wine is that the later CAN BE DONE. It is of mystical proportions to many of us, skilled in the art, that this biochemical function occurs so normally and makes such a lovely end product. Alas the science of fermentation the chemist share with the biologists, unfortunately as this would be a great feat to call our own. Since the yeast is doing the heavy lifting and it is technically alive (if you call laying in a pool of grape juice living) we have to say the the yeast is responsible. Fermentation is a rather simple process once you think about it: the simple conversion of sugar to alcohol. A more technical treatise is outlined below, only because I promised you that I would give you some of the ""inside scoop"" on this blog. During the primary fermentation of wine, the two grape sugars, glucose and fructose are converted to alcohol (ethanol) by the action of yeast. The by-products of primary fermentation are aromas and flavors, the gas carbon dioxide, and heat. The production of heat during fermentation (i.e. it is an exothermic process) means that during fermentation the temperature of the fermentation vessel will rise, and will require action on the part of the winemaker to cool it down. White wine fermentation is usually conducted in the range of 46-66F, and red wine fermentions typically are allowed to run at between 72 and 90F. At temperatures higher than this, there can be a loss of desirable aroma and flavour compounds, and unattractive aroma characters in the spectrum of caramel, burnt or cooked characters can be produced. There are many types of yeast, but two closely related types known as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces bayanus are the ones that are responsible for fermentation. These species of yeast are encouraged to conduct the fermentation because they: Are alcohol tolerant. That is, they can continue to ferment sugars to alcohol even during the latter stages of fermentation when the sugar is low but the alcohol content is high. Can establish a viable population in an environment of high sugar (190-270 grams per litre) and high acidity. Are strong and consistent fermenters even at cold temperatures. They ferment quickly and only stop when all the grape sugars have been utilised. Otherwise we would be buying sweet low alcohol wines. Are more tolerant to sulfur dioxide than other yeasts and bacteria. Since our friends at the aramo wheel were kind enough to allow us to pilfer some of this prose, I would suggest checking out there products, both the aroma wheel and the wine aroma dictionary, and long-lasting pack of scratch and sniff cards to aid in teaching the novice and expert alike in certain aroma characteristics in wine. You can find them at www.aromadictionary.com In white winemaking the juice is usually inoculated with yeast following its clarification. The most common type of inoculation is that using an active dried yeast culture. Yeasts are freeze dried and stored in vacuum packed tins by yeast supply companies ready for use. The winemaker then re-hydrates the yeast in warm water bringing them out of their state of suspended animation. The hydrated yeast is then added to the juice. Another less interventionist approach is to let nature take its course. The grapes have a bloom that contains active cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. After juicing the grapes these grape yeast cells and other yeast cells picked up from the winery equipment then start to convert the grape sugars to alcohol. This type of fermentation is variously called natural, indigenous or spontaneous fermentation. The former approach is common in New World winemaking while the latter is more often practiced in Europe. So what are the advantages and disadvantages of each approach to inoculation? The advantages of winemaker inoculation are: Choice. Many different strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been isolated and have different properties. Some produce very fruity (estery) aromas, others produce more neutral characters. Some ferment better at colder temperatures than others. Consistency. All strains are selected for their ability to meet the general necessary criteria given above. This maximises the chances of clean and complete fermentations occurring. The advantages of spontaneous inoculation are: Better Mouthfeel. Many commentators' report that they feel that spontaneous fermentation promotes better mouthfeel in wines. That is, the wines are thought to be softer and creamier than those made using single strain starter cultures. This suggestion however has not been conclusively demonstrated scientifically. The rational for the suggestion is that the natural yeast flora on the grape is genetically heterogeneous, i.e. consists of multiple strains and that this is the reason for the improved mouthfeel. Cost. Spontaneous fermentation costs nothing to initiate. The disadvantages of spontaneous fermentation are: Lag time. Yeast cells increase in number by division. One becomes two, two become four, four become eight etc. The initial numbers of yeast cells in an un-inoculated juice are by nature low. Dividing from a low initial base of cells means that it takes longer for fermentation to become active. A wait of 3-4 days is typical. In large commercial wineries where the vintage is planned to work like clockwork, with tanks becoming free just when purchased fruit is to arrive at the weighbridge, the uncertainties of spontaneous fermentation present excessive risk.

"he sat cross-legged on his table near a very large window, viewed by all who passed along the road, but scarce looking away from his work to exchange a nod with a passer-by. He shaved his face clean, that is to say he shaved it occasionally clean, but this was once a week only, on Saturday, and during the ensuing week a dusky shadow stole over cheek and chin that made Dan’l look anything but clean-shaved. He wore his hair short, but had thick and very protruding eyebrows. He was a reticent man. The tailor’s shop is often a place where many villagers congregate to have a chat, and the tailor is able to go on with his needlework in a mechanical fashion whilst conversing. But Daniel Coombe did not affect gossip and prattle; what he undertook he carried through with an almost grim persistency. As the gamekeeper said: “Bless you, old Coombe, he do lay hold on and stick to a job just as a ferret do to a rabbit. There ain’t no gettin’ him to quit it.” Coombe had a wife—the ugliest woman he could have picked up, but they lived contentedly enough together. They had no children. Had they possessed a family, a little more brightness and laughter would have entered into the household. Mrs. Coombe was a grumbler; she grumbled over her husband, over her house, over her work, over every thing and every person with which and with whom she was brought in contact. But Dan’l did not appear to mind it. He lived in a world of his own—his thoughts, his aspirations; and the mutter of discontent rumbled around him and rolled over his head, almost without his hearing it, certainly without his being moved by it. No sooner was the sun set, and Dan’l could no longer ply his needle, than he put up his shutters. In these were two round orifices, and till late at night lamplight streamed forth into the road through these holes, that were as a pair of eyes glaring down the village street. What was he doing in his workshop at night? Certainly he was not cutting out and sewing. It was a well-known saying of his that with the set of sun was the set aside of work. “I ain’t a-going to try my eyes and wear ’em out with needlework by lamplight,” said he. Then what was his occupation after nightfall? Into his workshop he retired and bolted the door from within as soon as he had taken his evening meal. Did he read? Was he a student of English literature? Was he a politician? He was no buyer of books, and subscribed to no other paper than the local weekly gazette. It puzzled the parish. It roused curiosity. Then some boys climbed up outside the window to peer in through the holes in the shutters, but the noise of their scrambling, perhaps the appearance of their visages in the openings, showed Dan’l that he was having his privacy peered into, and before the urchins were able to observe what his occupation was, out went the lamp. He had extinguished it. The married women of the parish endeavoured to extract the secret from Mrs. Coombe; but she was either ignorant or uncommunicative. “How should I know?” said she. “He has his megrims. I don’t meddle wi’ they. All I know is, he ain’t doing nothin’ as is good to nobody. But if it keeps him out o’ mischief and away from the public-house, naught I’ll say.” Then the idea took hold that Dan’l was a wise man and could charm, stanch blood by his blessing, drive away warts, cure milk that would not turn to butter, and counteract ill wishes. And to this he lent himself. He had not sought it. It was forced upon him. It might do good, he argued; it could do no harm. So his fame grew, and he was regarded with reverential awe. Whether he believed in his own efficacy as a healer, I cannot say; his gifts of healing were bruited about, his failures passed into the limbo of oblivion. He did not set store on his reputed powers, he rather disparaged them, or shrugged his shoulders and professed scepticism over them, and he always said: “Well, if good comes of it, it is not from me—you must know that—but from the great Healer of all. Some cures wi’ drugs, and some wi’ their touch. There are differences of administration.” Dan’l Coombe was a regular churchgoer. Woe betide the parson if, in preaching without a book, he quoted Scripture inaccurately. He became in time accustomed to find the tailor standing at the foot of the church steps awaiting him after service. Then would come the familiar touch of the hat, and, “I beg your pardon, sir, but did you not put in a _the_ where there oughtn’t to be, in that there text from St. Paul to the Corinthians?” Or else: “Please, sir, did you use the right word in that there quotation from the Acts?” “Dear Mr. Coombe, I took the marginal rendering.” “Oh, the margin. I don’t hold by that.” Mr. Coombe was very much perplexed when the new version of the Scriptures was issued. It happily was not read in the parish church. I verily believe it would have driven him from it. “Nasty, lumpy thing,” he said; “it is like eatin’ bad-made porridge. Nothin’ smooth about it. Bits come in your mouth and teeth at every moment.” He resented it as an immoral thing. “And to think,” said he, “that Christian money should ha’ been spent by Government out of our pockets to put this here stumbling-block in the way of the blind! It’s wicked, and I’ll vote against Government next ’lection.” As already said, there had been an attempt made by scaling to peer in at the holes in Coombe’s shutter, to see him at his nightly occupation. It had failed. After that he pasted",0,0.0
"As I stood at the entrance of Duke University, a wave of nostalgia washed over me. It had been years since I last set foot on this campus, the place that shaped me into the person I am today. As I walked beneath the towering Gothic architecture and among the vibrant fall-colored leaves, memories flooded my mind, transporting me back to a time when my biggest worry was passing my exams.

But as I admired the familiar landmarks, I couldn't help but notice the changes that had taken place since my graduation. New buildings had sprouted up, replacing the once-familiar spaces. The campus seemed even more alive and dynamic than before, reflecting the growth and progress that had occurred in my absence.

As I made my way towards the heart of campus, my heart brimmed with anticipation. The main quad, where I used to spend countless afternoons studying with friends, was bustling with activity. Students rushed past, textbooks in hand, their hurried steps mirroring the urgency I felt to reconnect with old acquaintances.

My first stop was the coffee shop just off-campus, a place where friends would gather to discuss everything from classes to dreams of the future. Upon entering, I noticed familiar faces seated around the tables, though slightly aged by time. Approaching them, I was greeted with warm smiles and exclamations of joy. It felt as though no time had passed at all. It was in these moments that I realized the true meaning of friendship – the ability to pick up right where we left off, despite the passage of years.

As we caught up on each other's lives, stories of new cities, careers, and aspirations were shared. Listening to them, I marveled at the diverse paths we had all taken. Some had pursued their passions in the arts, while others had embarked on challenging careers in medicine or law. I couldn't help but feel a twinge of pride for my friends' accomplishments, and a renewed sense of motivation to pursue my own dreams.

Walking through the campus, I encountered acquaintances who had once been mere faces in a lecture hall. We exchanged brief but sincere greetings, acknowledging the shared memories we had of late nights studying in the library and heated debates in class. It was humbling to realize that, despite our diverging paths, we had all started here, at this very place, pursuing knowledge and striving for a better future.

In the midst of these encounters, I couldn't help but reflect on my own journey. As I wandered through the familiar halls, I questioned whether I had made the right choices since leaving Duke. Had I pursued my dreams with the same vigor as my friends? Had I taken enough risks and embraced new opportunities? The answers were elusive, as questions about personal fulfillment often are.

Yet, being back on campus, surrounded by the energy and camaraderie, I felt a renewed sense of purpose. The ambitious goals I had set for myself during my time at Duke resurfaced, reminding me of the passion that had once burned brightly within me. The visit served as a reminder that life is not a linear path, but a series of experiences and choices that shape us.

As the sun began to set, casting a warm golden glow over the campus, I bid farewell to my friends and acquaintances, carrying with me a mix of bittersweet emotions. Although my visit was merely a fleeting moment in time, it had reignited the flame of ambition within me. I walked away from Duke knowing that the memories and connections forged here would forever be etched in my heart, reminding me of the person I once was and the person I still aspire to become.",1,0.0
"Oh man, let me tell you about my epic trip to Jaipur, India! It was hands down one of the most incredible travel experiences of my life. From the moment I landed at the airport, I was thrown into a whirlwind of vibrant colors, bustling markets, and rich cultural heritage. I couldn't have asked for a better introduction to the Pink City!

My journey began with a car ride from the airport to the heart of Jaipur. As we drove through the city, I couldn't help but notice the unique shade of pink that adorned the buildings. They call it the Pink City for a reason, and boy, does it live up to its name! The entire city seemed to be bathed in this beautiful hue, giving it a magical and otherworldly feel.

One of the highlights of my trip was visiting the magnificent Amber Fort. As I approached the fort, I was greeted by the sight of majestic elephants lined up, waiting to take visitors up the hill. I couldn't resist the temptation and hopped on one of them. It was an exhilarating experience, riding on the back of an elephant, feeling the gentle sway as it made its way up to the fort. The views from the top were breathtaking! I could see the entire city sprawling before me, with its vibrant markets, bustling streets, and historic palaces.

Exploring the city itself was an adventure in itself. The narrow, winding lanes were filled with a kaleidoscope of sights and sounds. Everywhere I looked, there were bustling bazaars, with vendors selling everything from colorful textiles to intricate handicrafts. I couldn't resist the urge to indulge in some retail therapy, and I ended up splurging on beautiful fabrics, jewelry, and trinkets to take back home with me.

One thing that struck me about Jaipur was the sheer number of camels on the roads. It was like a scene out of a Bollywood movie! The sight of these majestic creatures ambling along amidst the chaos of the traffic was both amusing and surreal. I even took a camel ride myself, just to experience it firsthand. Let me tell you, bouncing along on the back of a camel is no joke! It was a bumpy but hilarious adventure that left me with memories I'll never forget.

And speaking of unique encounters, I can't forget to mention the mischievous monkeys that seemed to be everywhere. These little rascals were always up to some antics, jumping from rooftop to rooftop and darting through the streets. I had to be careful and keep an eye on my belongings, as they were known for snatching anything they could get their hands on. But despite their mischievous nature, I couldn't help but find their presence endearing.

Jaipur truly encapsulated the spirit of India. The city was alive with energy and charm, and its rich history and culture were evident in every nook and cranny. The people were warm and welcoming, and I felt like I was truly immersed in the vibrant tapestry of Indian life. I was fortunate enough to witness a traditional dance performance, devour mouth-watering street food, and soak up the atmosphere in the bustling markets.

As I bid farewell to Jaipur, I couldn't help but feel a sense of longing to return one day. The city had captured my heart with its vivid colors, breathtaking architecture, and warm hospitality. It was an adventure I'll cherish forever, and I can't wait to embark on another journey to explore the wonders of India.",1,0.0
"Marriage, ah, what a loaded word. It carries with it a heavy weight of societal expectations and norms, but what does it truly mean? What does it mean to me? As I pondered this question, I realized that the answer I had in mind didn't quite fit the traditional mold. And so, I embarked on a journey of self-discovery, grappling with the complexities and nuances of this institution.

Growing up, I had a rather conventional understanding of marriage. It was an endpoint, a goal to be achieved in life. It meant finding someone to spend the rest of my days with, someone to love and be loved by. It was a union between a man and a woman, bound by love and commitment. But as I ventured into the realms of adulthood, my perspectives on marriage began to shift.

The first challenge I encountered was reconciling the different perspectives on marriage between genders. I soon realized that society often imposes gender roles and expectations on couples, perpetuating certain stereotypes. The idea that a woman should prioritize her family and sacrifice her career for the sake of marriage seemed archaic and limiting. Similarly, the expectation that a man should always be the breadwinner and shoulder the financial burden of a family struck me as unfair. These rigid societal expectations felt suffocating, and I couldn't help but question their validity.

Furthermore, the topic of sex in marriage added another layer of complexity to my understanding. Society often paints marriage as an institution governed by sexual exclusivity. But as I reflected on this, I wondered if it was fair to place such emphasis on sex as a defining factor of a successful marriage. Isn't there more to a relationship than just physical intimacy? What about emotional connection, intellectual stimulation, and mutual respect? Shouldn't these aspects be considered equally important?

As I delved deeper into my exploration, I couldn't ignore the influence of my Christian faith on my understanding of marriage. The Bible teaches that marriage is a sacred covenant between a man and a woman, a reflection of the love and commitment between Christ and the Church. It emphasizes the importance of selflessness, forgiveness, and mutual submission. While I respected these teachings, I struggled to reconcile them with some of the more traditional notions of marriage.

Ultimately, through much contemplation and introspection, I came to realize that the meaning of marriage is deeply personal and subjective. It is not solely defined by societal norms or religious teachings, but rather it is an intimate bond between two individuals. It is a commitment to love, support, and grow together, transcending gender roles and societal expectations.

However, this realization also brought with it another challenge - how to translate this unconventional understanding of marriage into an examination question. The traditional examination question might ask about the purpose or goals of marriage, expecting a response that aligns with popular notions of matrimony. But what about those who don't conform to societal norms? What about those who seek unconventional paths?

Perhaps the examination question could be reframed to encourage critical thinking and open-mindedness. Rather than asking for a prescriptive answer, it could invite students to explore the various perspectives on marriage, encouraging them to think beyond the confines of tradition. This would allow for a broader understanding of marriage and its complexities, fostering empathy and acceptance for diverse experiences.

In examining the meaning of marriage, we also come face to face with the importance of compromise. Marriage, at its core, is a partnership built on compromise and mutual understanding. It requires both individuals to let go of their egos and work towards a common goal. And this principle of compromise extends beyond the boundaries of marriage itself. In a world filled with conflict and division, the ability to compromise is vital for fostering understanding and harmony.

So, in conclusion, the meaning of marriage is a deeply personal journey, shaped by societal expectations, religious beliefs, and individual experiences. It is an institution that is evolving, as we challenge and redefine its traditional boundaries. And as we reflect on the meaning of marriage, may we also recognize its potential for growth and change, both within our personal lives and in the broader context of society.",1,0.0
"That they exceeded the fiendishness of the men, the man’s cries attested. Subienkow looked on, and shuddered. He was not afraid to die. He had carried his life too long in his hands, on that weary trail from Warsaw to Nulato, to shudder at mere dying. But he objected to the torture. It offended his soul. And this offence, in turn, was not due to the mere pain he must endure, but to the sorry spectacle the pain would make of him. He knew that he would pray, and beg, and entreat, even as Big Ivan and the others that had gone before. This would not be nice. To pass out bravely and cleanly, with a smile and a jest—ah! that would have been the way. But to lose control, to have his soul upset by the pangs of the flesh, to screech and gibber like an ape, to become the veriest beast—ah, that was what was so terrible. There had been no chance to escape. From the beginning, when he dreamed the fiery dream of Poland’s independence, he had become a puppet in the hands of Fate. From the beginning, at Warsaw, at St. Petersburg, in the Siberian mines, in Kamtchatka, on the crazy boats of the fur-thieves, Fate had been driving him to this end. Without doubt, in the foundations of the world was graved this end for him—for him, who was so fine and sensitive, whose nerves scarcely sheltered under his skin, who was a dreamer, and a poet, and an artist. Before he was dreamed of, it had been determined that the quivering bundle of sensitiveness that constituted him should be doomed to live in raw and howling savagery, and to die in this far land of night, in this dark place beyond the last boundaries of the world. He sighed. So that thing before him was Big Ivan—Big Ivan the giant, the man without nerves, the man of iron, the Cossack turned freebooter of the seas, who was as phlegmatic as an ox, with a nervous system so low that what was pain to ordinary men was scarcely a tickle to him. Well, well, trust these Nulato Indians to find Big Ivan’s nerves and trace them to the roots of his quivering soul. They were certainly doing it. It was inconceivable that a man could suffer so much and yet live. Big Ivan was paying for his low order of nerves. Already he had lasted twice as long as any of the others. Subienkow felt that he could not stand the Cossack’s sufferings much longer. Why didn’t Ivan die? He would go mad if that screaming did not cease. But when it did cease, his turn would come. And there was Yakaga awaiting him, too, grinning at him even now in anticipation—Yakaga, whom only last week he had kicked out of the fort, and upon whose face he had laid the lash of his dog-whip. Yakaga would attend to him. Doubtlessly Yakaga was saving for him more refined tortures, more exquisite nerve-racking. Ah! that must have been a good one, from the way Ivan screamed. The squaws bending over him stepped back with laughter and clapping of hands. Subienkow saw the monstrous thing that had been perpetrated, and began to laugh hysterically. The Indians looked at him in wonderment that he should laugh. But Subienkow could not stop. This would never do. He controlled himself, the spasmodic twitchings slowly dying away. He strove to think of other things, and began reading back in his own life. He remembered his mother and his father, and the little spotted pony, and the French tutor who had taught him dancing and sneaked him an old worn copy of Voltaire. Once more he saw Paris, and dreary London, and gay Vienna, and Rome. And once more he saw that wild group of youths who had dreamed, even as he, the dream of an independent Poland with a king of Poland on the throne at Warsaw. Ah, there it was that the long trail began. Well, he had lasted longest. One by one, beginning with the two executed at St. Petersburg, he took up the count of the passing of those brave spirits. Here one had been beaten to death by a jailer, and there, on that bloodstained highway of the exiles, where they had marched for endless months, beaten and maltreated by their Cossack guards, another had dropped by the way. Always it had been savagery—brutal, bestial savagery. They had died—of fever, in the mines, under the knout. The last two had died after the escape, in the battle with the Cossacks, and he alone had won to Kamtchatka with the stolen papers and the money of a traveller he had left lying in the snow. It had been nothing but savagery. All the years, with his heart in studios, and theatres, and courts, he had been hemmed in by savagery. He had purchased his life with blood. Everybody had killed. He had killed that traveller for his passports. He had proved that he was a man of parts by duelling with two Russian officers on a single day. He had had to prove himself in order to win to a place among the fur-thieves. He had had to win to that place. Behind him lay the thousand-years-long road across all Siberia and Russia. He could not escape that way. The only way was ahead, across the dark and icy sea of Bering to Alaska. The way had led from savagery to deeper savagery. On the scurvy-rotten ships of the fur-thieves, out of food and out of water, buffeted by the interminable storms of that stormy sea, men had become animals. Thrice he had sailed east from Kamtchatka. And thrice, after all manner of hardship and suffering, the survivors had come back to Kamtchatka. There had been no outlet for escape, and he could not go back the way he had come, for the mines and the knout awaited",0,0.0
"This weekend was an extremely difficult one for me. It seemed like it was going to be just like any other one, but it quickly took a turn for the worst. On Friday evening, Mike and I fed Corny as we usually did, however we noticed that he had not eaten his food from the night before and his breathing appeared to be labored. We watched him carefully for about ten minutes, as it was not unusal for Corny to act quirky, however it became clear that this was not one of those instances. As Mike went downstairs to call the emergency vet, I remained with Corny at the top of our stairs, and I became visibly emotional. Corny looked at me with very wide eyes, rolled for me, then put his head forward to mine and began purring. I took his gestures to me as a sign that everything was going to be alright. By 9:30 PM, after driving forty minutes, we arrived at the nearest emergency vet. They immediately examined Corny and believed that his labored breathing was not so severe and that perhaps it might be caused by asthma or nerves. We happily took this explanation, as Corny was indeed a nervous cat, and we sat in the waiting room and waiting nearly two hours for the full examination. The Vet ER was VERY busy that night -- lots of dogs coming in and needing immediate medical attention because they were bleeding and required stitches. While we were waiting, I read some of the ""thank you"" cards that were posted on one wall. I was a bit confused as to why so many cards were received, but I didn't pay it very much attention. At 11:30 PM, we entered an exam room where both the doctor on site and the nurses could examine Corny more thoroughly. By this time, his breathing became a little more labored, yet still nothing to be alarmed about. The nurse took him and put him on oxygen to help calm his nerves. The doctor revealed to us that she would need to do some x-rays in order to determine the cause of his breathing problems. After about an hour, which seemed like an eternity, the doctor came back with two sets of x-rays. First, she showed us the x-rays of a ""normal"" cat's lungs. Then, she showed us Corny's. His lungs had become so filled with fluid of some sort that the x-rays did not even show his heart. The doctor ran through a vast list of all the things that Corny could potentially have -- none of which could be considered ""good"". We hoped, at best, that he had feline leukemia, and believed that at worst, he had a cardiac disease. No one would know for sure until blood work and the examination of the fluid from his lungs was done. We agreed to leave him there overnight and to be back at 7 AM so the doctor could remove the fluid from his lungs and perform tests on him so we could have a better idea of what course of action we would need to take come morning. The nurse brought Corny back to us in the exam room, and I hugged him and told him that I loved him and that I would see him in the morning. He put his head on my wrist and just sat still. He seemed very weak, but he did his best to keep that brave face on. The doctors and nurses were shocked when they saw the x-rays because Corny's outward personality and appearance was no indication of how bad he was on the inside. As the doctor held him to take him to do tests, I told her that he gives hugs, and her faced warmed with a smile. She said that it is very special that he hugs because not many cats do. I knew he was in good hands. When Mike and I arrived back home around a quarter after 2 in the morning, we called the vet to check on Corny. The nurse sounded like she was in good spirits and said that he was doing just fine. We confirmed that we would be back there at 7 AM, and decided that we needed to get some rest since we knew it was going to be a VERY long weekend. At 5:45 AM, we received a phone call from the vet. She indicated that he was not doing so good and that after she removed the fluid from his lungs, he was difficulty breathing on his own. She asked permission to euthanize him because she was not sure that he would make it. We told her that we would be there in 40 minutes and not to do anything to him until we got there. She asked our permission to give him pain killers, and we agreed to that. She stated that she did not believe he would last for us to see him before he passed on. We got to the ER Vet by 6:30 in the morning on Saturday, and we were immediately brought into an exam room. A minute later, they brought Corny to us, wrapped in a blue thermal blanket. The doctor explained that as soon as we got there, his breathing stopped, however his heart was still beathing so he could hear, see and feel us. I kissed his head several times and kept petting him and telling him that we loved him very much and I saw him looking at me. Then, I moved out of the way and pushed Mike into Corny's view. Mike did the same, and we pet corny until he died a few minutes later. The doctor and nurses were very warm to us, and the doctor even hugged me. She explained that he was a very strong cat and that he waited over forty minutes for us to get there before we began to pass. She then",0,0.0
"Tzanetos ""Kapetanakis"" Grigorakis (Greek: Τζανέτος Καπετανάκης Γρηγοράκης; 1742–1813), also known as Zanetos or Tzanibey or Zanibey or Tzanetbey or Zanetbey, was a Greek politician, general[note 1] and the 3rd bey of Mani,[note 2] the most prominent together with Petrobey Mavromichalis.[1] He was the longest-ruling bey of the Maniots, serving for 16 years, from 1782 to 1798.[2] Grigorakis was born in 1742 at Skoutari of Gytheio, Laconia, and was a member of a famous Maniot family, Grigorakides, which was a warrior family of local Capetaneoi.[note 3] His father, Demetrios ""Kapetanakis"" Grigorakis, gave him the name Tzanetos or Tzannis, as the name Ioannis (Ιωάννης, John) is pronounced in Maniot dialect. Tzanetos was the father of Pierros (Πιέρρος, Peter) and Tzortzis (Τζωρτζής, George), or Tzortzakis Grigorakis, who later became the ancestor of the Tzortzakides branch.[note 4] His grandson, and son of Tzortzis, Tzannetakis Grigorakis, later became the ancestor of the Tzannetakides branch.[1] Grigorakis started the military service within his clan, like everybody else in Mani. Later, in Russo-Turkish War of 1768–1774, he appeared in the Ionian Islands, together with Anagnostaras and Christoforos Perraivos, to serve with the rank of major in the Imperial Russian Army forces under the commands of the Greek-Russian general Emmanouil Papadopoulos.[3] Hassan Ghazi, the ruler of Tripoli, asked the family of Grigorakides to accept that Tzanetos Grigorakis will take over the duties of bey and use the power of their clan to achieve peace in Mani and their neighboring areas. However, when the Grigorakides family rejected his proposal, he proposed Tzanetos Koutifaris as bey of Mani.[4] Hassan Ghazi sent an envoy to the Grigorakides family leader, Exarchos Grigorakis, saying that he wanted to negotiate. The men met in Tripoli, but once Exarchos arrived, Hasan Ghazi had him seized and hanged.[5] When this fact was learned in Skoutari, Tzanetos Grigorakis took over the hegemony as general. To get revenge, he gathered about 3,000 Maniots, campaigning against the Ottomans in the castle of Passavas, and captured and slaughtered the 700 families living in and around of it- men, women, children, no one was left. After the massacre, he increased the Mani borders at position of Kakoskali, a new border line that the Ottomans never managed to regain.[6] In 1780, in the aftermath of the Orlov Revolt and just before the Siege of Kastania, Tzanetos Grigorakis received a message with an envoy from his son-in-law Panagiotaros Venetsanakis and Konstantinos Kolokotronis to send a relief force and avoid the siege, but Grigorakis having a personal rivalry with Panagiotaros, resigned to the fact that they would have to fight alone.[7][8] The refusal of support and assistance to the Kastanian chiefs[note 5] in 1780, objectively served the plans of Kapudan Pasha Hassan, so the Ottoman military leader did not forget it and, in 1782, Tzanetos Grigorakis became the Bey of Mani.[7] At first, Grigorakis refused to become a bey, but then the Dragoman of the Fleet of the Ottomans, Nikolaos Mavrogenis, the great-uncle of Manto Mavrogenous and later Prince of Wallachia, came to Gytheio[note 6] and kidnapped him, and he also sent as hostages to the Sultan Abdul Hamid I the two sons of Grigorakis and took him as prisoner to Spetses, where Grigorakis was forced to accept the proposal of the Ottomans.[2][5] Grigorakis decided to build forts on the border line, occupying all the surrounding areas, renovating the towers or building new ones, and transferring his hegemony from Skoutari to Gytheio, were he found Marathonisi, and also found a new village on the nearby hill Lykovouni, which it named after the region's old name as Mavrovouni, Laconia.[9][10] He also built a tower in Mavrovouni and permanently moved there after 1806.[11][10] Grigorakis began agreements with the Russians to help him oust the Ottomans from the Peloponnese. In 1787, with the start of the new Russo-Turkish War, Grigorakis tried to strengthen the Russians by activating the Maniates with a letter from the Russian general Dmitry Senyavin.[12] The Russo-Turkish War termination treaty took place in 1792, but Lambros Katsonis refused to abide by the agreement while hosted in Mani to Achileion, so the Ottomans asked Grigorakis to chase him and arrest him.[13] Katsonis was staying at Grigorakis' house in Mavrovouni, when the Ottomans learned of this and rushed to arrest him.[11] Grigorakis alerted Katsonis to leave and hid his officers and sailors in the villages of Mani, so the Ottomans captured 11 empty ships.[14] After 1792, the Ottomans did not trust Grigorakis, so he decided to build a castle on the hill of Mavrovouni village. In 1795 the castle was finished and named Melissi castle, also known as Castle of Mavrovouni or Goulades or Beanica or Beanka.[15] In 1798, after the departure of the Russians, Grigorakis decided to turn to the French, sending a letter to Napoleon Bonaparte with Demetrio Stefanopoli, writing to him that he would allow the mooring and supply of French ships in Mani.[10] Bonaparte sent a reply letter with Stefanopoli, in which he accepted the agreement.[16][17] Grigorakis sent to Bonaparte his son Pierros Grigorakis, major of the Imperial Russian Army. Pierros fought in Italy, where he distinguished himself and was wounded, but won Bonaparte's regard, who gave secret instructions to Demetrio Stefanopoli to meet all the representatives of the Greek areas, but Grigorakis suggested that Demetrio stay in Mani and safely meet everyone from there. Indeed, he did, and later, in 1801, Grigorakis was supplied with gunpowder by Bonaparte.[16][18] The Ottomans soon realized that something was wrong and they decided to attack Grigorakis, sending three ships to the port to disembark strong army forces, while at the same time attacking, encircling Mani with their armies from Mystras and Vardounia. Grigorakis convened a war council, were Demetrio also participated, and decided to resist with a direct counterattack from many points with small army units.[19] Although he had only 1,000 men at his disposal, the Ottomans suffered heavy casualties and retreated to Mystras and their ships, so the counterattack had a successful result.[20] After this fact, in 1798, the Ottomans had Grigorakis replaced as bey",0,0.0
"Understanding different cultures is an essential aspect of being a global citizen. As an individual, I have come to realize the significance of embracing diversity and learning about various cultures. Having a deep understanding of different cultures not only broadens our perspective but also helps us appreciate our own culture in a much more profound way. Through this essay, I will explain the importance of understanding different cultures and provide examples illustrating how personal knowledge of another culture enhances our understanding of our own.

First and foremost, understanding different cultures fosters empathy and tolerance. When we take the time to learn about other cultures, we gain insight into their customs, traditions, and values. This knowledge allows us to see the world through the eyes of others and appreciate the differences that make each culture unique. It helps us understand why people from different cultures have different perspectives and behave in ways that may seem unfamiliar to us. By understanding and respecting these differences, we can reduce prejudice and discrimination, promoting a more inclusive and harmonious society.

Furthermore, learning about different cultures enriches our own cultural heritage. Through comparative analysis, we can evaluate our own cultural norms and values by juxtaposing them with those of other cultures. For example, I belong to a culture that values punctuality and efficiency. However, when I learned about the concept of ""flexible time"" in some Latin American cultures, I realized that different societies have different priorities and ways of organizing time. This understanding allowed me to reflect on my own culture and appreciate the significance of flexibility and adaptability in certain contexts. By exposing ourselves to different cultural practices, we challenge our existing beliefs and foster personal growth.

In addition, understanding different cultures opens doors to new opportunities and experiences. In today's interconnected world, individuals who possess cross-cultural competence have a distinct advantage. Employers, for instance, increasingly value employees who can effectively navigate and communicate with diverse groups of people. Having knowledge of different cultures allows us to adapt and interact more effectively in various professional settings. Moreover, it opens doors for us to explore and appreciate new cuisines, art forms, music, and literature that we may not have encountered otherwise. Traveling to different countries and immersing ourselves in their cultures is an excellent way to gain firsthand experience and broaden our horizons.

One example of how my personal knowledge of another culture helped me better understand my own is when I learned about the philosophy of ikigai in Japanese culture. Ikigai, which roughly translates to ""reason for being,"" focuses on finding purpose and fulfillment in life. As a person growing up in a fast-paced Western society, I realized how much we prioritize productivity and material success. However, learning about ikigai made me question the values of my own culture and reflect on the importance of finding balance and meaning in my life. This newfound knowledge allowed me to appreciate the wisdom of other cultures and integrate their teachings into my own life.

Understanding different cultures also aids in effective communication across cultural boundaries. Language is an essential aspect of any culture, and by learning a new language, we gain insight into the nuances of that culture. When we communicate in someone else's native language, it demonstrates respect and effort, enabling deeper connections and fostering understanding. Moreover, language is deeply intertwined with culture, and through language, we can unravel layers of cultural meanings and references.

Lastly, understanding different cultures promotes cultural awareness and preserves traditions. In a fast-paced, globalized world, it is crucial to ensure that traditional practices, customs, and languages are preserved. By exchanging knowledge and engaging in intercultural dialogue, we can celebrate and honor different cultures, thus preventing the loss of traditional heritage. This not only helps preserve cultural diversity but also ensures that future generations can learn from and appreciate the rich tapestry of human civilizations.

In conclusion, understanding different cultures is not merely a luxury but a necessity in today's interconnected world. It fosters empathy, tolerance, and cultural awareness while broadening our own perspective. Our personal knowledge of different cultures enhances our understanding of our own culture, enabling us to appreciate our heritage in a more profound way. By embracing diversity and learning from others, we can build bridges of understanding and create a more inclusive and harmonious global community.",1,0.0

"The Baháʼí Faith in Iceland (Icelandic Baháʼí samfélagið á Íslandi) began with Baháʼís first visiting the Iceland in the early 20th century, and the first Icelandic Baháʼí was Hólmfríður Árnadóttir. The Baháʼí Faith was recognized as a religious community in 1966 and the first Baháʼí National Spiritual Assembly was elected in 1972.[1] Currently there are around 400 Baháʼís in the country and 13 Baháʼí Local Spiritual Assemblies. The number of assemblies is the highest percentage, by population, in all of Europe.[1] The first mentions of Iceland is when ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, the son of the founder of the religion, wrote a series of letters, or tablets, to the followers of the religion in the United States and Canada in 1916–1917; these letters were compiled together in the book titled Tablets of the Divine Plan. The seventh of the tablets was the first to mention several countries in Europe including beyond where ʻAbdu'l-Bahá had visited in 1911–12. He wrote ""In brief, this world-consuming war has set such a conflagration to the hearts that no word can describe it. In all the countries of the world the longing for universal peace is taking possession of the consciousness of men. There is not a soul who does not yearn for concord and peace. A most wonderful state of receptivity is being realized.… Therefore, O ye believers of God! Show ye an effort and after this war spread ye the synopsis of the divine teachings in the British Isles, France, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Russia, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Holland, Portugal, Rumania, Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria, Greece, Andorra, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Monaco, San Marino, Balearic Isles, Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily, Crete, Malta, Iceland, Faroe Islands, Shetland Islands, Hebrides and Orkney Islands.""[2] Following the release of these tablets a few Baháʼís began moving to or at least visiting countries across Europe. The first Baháʼí in Iceland was Amelia Collins who visited the country during a cruise in 1924.[3] During that trip she met Hólmfríður Árnadóttir, who became the first Icelandic Baháʼí,[4] and became good friends.[3] Later in 1935 Martha Root visited the country for a month and with the help of Árnadóttir proclaimed the religion in the press, during lectures, and on the radio.[4][5] In 1936 a Baháʼí, Nellie French, made her first visit to the country while on a trip to Norway and distributed literature.[6] Amelia Collins continued to support the spread of the religion in Iceland as she supported the publication of the first translation of Baháʼí literature, John Esslemont's Baháʼu'lláh and the New Era, in Icelandic in 1939.[3] By 1949 there were still just two Baháʼís in Iceland.[7] In February 1956 the first pioneer arrived in Iceland from Canada[8] Marguerite Allman, this pioneer, later sent word of the first native Icelander joining the religion by 1957[9] - her name was Erica Petursson.[10] These first contacts with Iceland returned few visible results except for Árnadóttir becoming a Baháʼí[11] but by 1963 there was a registered group of Baháʼís in Reykjavík[12] including two American pioneers.[13] In 1964 a Canadian Baháʼí visited all the members of the community including a long trek to visit Jochum Eggertson who lived several months of the year in a remote location - that land he later willed for the Baháʼí community and it became a site for a summer school and an endowment.[14] The first Baháʼí Local Spiritual Assembly of Iceland is elected in 1965.[15] Its members were Asgeir Einarsson, Kirsten Bonnevie, Florence Grindlay, Jessie Echevarria, Carl John Spencer, Charles Grindlay, Liesel Becker, Barbel Thinat and Nicholas Echevarria.[16] The Baháʼí Faith was officially recognized as a religious organization by the Icelandic government on September 29, 1966, which gave it the right to legally perform marriages and other ceremonies as well as entitle it to a share of the church tax in proportion to its number of adult members.[17] Until 1973, when Ásatrúarfélagið was founded, the Baháʼí Community was the only non-Christian religious organization in Iceland and it remained the largest such organization until 1999 when it was passed in numbers by the Buddhist Association of Iceland.[18] On August 16, 1967, a Baháʼí wedding took place in Árbæjarkirkja, a church belonging to the Lutheran Church of Iceland. The bride was Icelandic and the groom Italian. The officiant was Ásgeir Einarsson, the man recognized by the government as head of the group (though individual Baháʼís hold no leadership roles). Ásgeir Einarsson commented that the Church of Iceland had been more friendly to the Baháʼí community than state churches in other countries and that Bishop Sigurbjörn Einarsson had given them a ""favorable and sympathetic"" evaluation when they applied to the government for recognition.[19] When word of the wedding ceremony reached the bishop, he expressed surprise that it had taken place in a Christian church and commented that he would have recommended against such an action.[20] Suffragan bishop Sigurður Pálsson went further and suggested that the church would need to be reconsecrated before Christian ceremonies could resume in it.[21] Bishop Sigurbjörn Einarsson disagreed, stating that the Baháʼí ceremony had been ""a mistake, but not sinful action"" and that the church had ""not been defiled by it"".[22] In Dec 1970 Canadians Baháʼís sponsored a Victory Conference anticipating the 1972 formation of the National Assembly. At the conference 30 people enrolled in the religion, doubling the number of Baháʼís in Iceland.[15] Three additional local assemblies were formed in Iceland in August 1971.[23] In September 1971, the Baháʼís of Reykjavík were the host of the North Atlantic Baháʼí Oceanic conference. Through the first half of the 1970s Iceland was the only country in Europe that has planned and systematically carried out, year by year, a program of proclamation that has taken the Faith throughout the entire country, north, south, east and west.[24] Hands of the Cause John Robarts and Paul Haney were in attendance at the oceanic conference[25] along with seven Continental Counsellors and some 700 Baháʼís from 35 countries. Tributes were held for Amelia Collins and Martha Root at the Einar Jónsson Museum. The conference began with a unity",0,0.0
"Pontellier had the privilege of quitting their society when they ceased to be entertaining. He stopped before the door of his own cottage, which was the fourth one from the main building and next to the last. Seating himself in a wicker rocker which was there, he once more applied himself to the task of reading the newspaper. The day was Sunday; the paper was a day old. The Sunday papers had not yet reached Grand Isle. He was already acquainted with the market reports, and he glanced restlessly over the editorials and bits of news which he had not had time to read before quitting New Orleans the day before. Mr. Pontellier wore eye-glasses. He was a man of forty, of medium height and rather slender build; he stooped a little. His hair was brown and straight, parted on one side. His beard was neatly and closely trimmed. Once in a while he withdrew his glance from the newspaper and looked about him. There was more noise than ever over at the house. The main building was called “the house,” to distinguish it from the cottages. The chattering and whistling birds were still at it. Two young girls, the Farival twins, were playing a duet from “Zampa” upon the piano. Madame Lebrun was bustling in and out, giving orders in a high key to a yard-boy whenever she got inside the house, and directions in an equally high voice to a dining-room servant whenever she got outside. She was a fresh, pretty woman, clad always in white with elbow sleeves. Her starched skirts crinkled as she came and went. Farther down, before one of the cottages, a lady in black was walking demurely up and down, telling her beads. A good many persons of the pension had gone over to the Cheniere Caminada in Beaudelet's lugger to hear mass. Some young people were out under the wateroaks playing croquet. Mr. Pontellier's two children were there--sturdy little fellows of four and five. A quadroon nurse followed them about with a faraway, meditative air. Mr. Pontellier finally lit a cigar and began to smoke, letting the paper drag idly from his hand. He fixed his gaze upon a white sunshade that was advancing at snail's pace from the beach. He could see it plainly between the gaunt trunks of the water-oaks and across the stretch of yellow camomile. The gulf looked far away, melting hazily into the blue of the horizon. The sunshade continued to approach slowly. Beneath its pink-lined shelter were his wife, Mrs. Pontellier, and young Robert Lebrun. When they reached the cottage, the two seated themselves with some appearance of fatigue upon the upper step of the porch, facing each other, each leaning against a supporting post. “What folly! to bathe at such an hour in such heat!” exclaimed Mr. Pontellier. He himself had taken a plunge at daylight. That was why the morning seemed long to him. “You are burnt beyond recognition,” he added, looking at his wife as one looks at a valuable piece of personal property which has suffered some damage. She held up her hands, strong, shapely hands, and surveyed them critically, drawing up her fawn sleeves above the wrists. Looking at them reminded her of her rings, which she had given to her husband before leaving for the beach. She silently reached out to him, and he, understanding, took the rings from his vest pocket and dropped them into her open palm. She slipped them upon her fingers; then clasping her knees, she looked across at Robert and began to laugh. The rings sparkled upon her fingers. He sent back an answering smile. “What is it?” asked Pontellier, looking lazily and amused from one to the other. It was some utter nonsense; some adventure out there in the water, and they both tried to relate it at once. It did not seem half so amusing when told. They realized this, and so did Mr. Pontellier. He yawned and stretched himself. Then he got up, saying he had half a mind to go over to Klein's hotel and play a game of billiards. “Come go along, Lebrun,” he proposed to Robert. But Robert admitted quite frankly that he preferred to stay where he was and talk to Mrs. Pontellier. “Well, send him about his business when he bores you, Edna,” instructed her husband as he prepared to leave. “Here, take the umbrella,” she exclaimed, holding it out to him. He accepted the sunshade, and lifting it over his head descended the steps and walked away. “Coming back to dinner?” his wife called after him. He halted a moment and shrugged his shoulders. He felt in his vest pocket; there was a ten-dollar bill there. He did not know; perhaps he would return for the early dinner and perhaps he would not. It all depended upon the company which he found over at Klein's and the size of “the game.” He did not say this, but she understood it, and laughed, nodding good-by to him. Both children wanted to follow their father when they saw him starting out. He kissed them and promised to bring them back bonbons and peanuts. II Mrs. Pontellier's eyes were quick and bright; they were a yellowish brown, about the color of her hair. She had a way of turning them swiftly upon an object and holding them there as if lost in some inward maze of contemplation or thought. Her eyebrows were a shade darker than her hair. They were thick and almost horizontal, emphasizing the depth of her eyes. She was rather handsome than beautiful. Her face was captivating by reason of a certain frankness of expression and a contradictory subtle play of features. Her manner was engaging. Robert rolled a cigarette. He smoked cigarettes because he could not afford cigars, he said. He had a cigar in his pocket which Mr. Pontellier had presented him with, and he was saving it for his after-dinner smoke. This seemed",0,0.0
"On friday I went on a San Francisco tour. We had to board on the bus at 6.15 am. The bus was late and we talk to everyone and it seem like everyone was going to different places but only one bus came. We though it's not going to be our bus but everyone got one it and we were the only one left and we went to ask and good thing we did b/c we needed to get in there. The bus took us to San Gabriel and we abort another bus. (2hrs) That bus took us to Solvang, an Dannish town. In Solvang we had an hour and half to have lunch and look around. We ate at this Dannish restaurant that was expensive and not that great of food. Then we walk around and bought some stuff at the gift shop. After that we went to Hearst castle. (2hrs) We got to go on another bus to get us up to the castle. That ride took around 15 minutes and it was scary b/c we were going up hill in a small lane and there no rails on the side in case if the bus tip over it will save us from rolling down the hill. The castle was big and has a lot of fine art. The stairs were crowed and small to go through. The views from the castle on the balcony is amazing. There were 2 giants pools that was very cool. After hearst castle it was another hour and half to get to our dinner place. We went to a buffet that the tour guide recomended us and it wasn't that good. We had an hour for dinner and then we would head back to our MOTEL. The Motel wasn't nice at all and there wasn't that many channels on t.vs, only 14 channels. On top of that we had to wake up at 4;15 am to leave at 5:am to go to yosemite. The drive to Yosemite was almost 3 hours and one hour of it was in the forest with the bus turning every 5 second. There wasn't much there at Yosemite excepts TREEEEEEESSSSSSS. We had an hour there to look around. We went to see that water fall but was dissapointed b/c there was only a little bit of water coming out of it. After seeing that we had breakfast which was expensive, 8 bucks for a plate of 2 strips of bacon, a scop of potatoes, 2 eggs, 2 slices of bread and a milk for 8 bucks. well actually it's not that bad comparing to that Dannish restaurant. We got back on the bus and stay in there for almost 3 hours to San Fransico. Once we got off, we went on a San Francisco cruise on the Red and White boat. The cruise was nice and we got to see some seagull flying right near the boat. It was a fun ride on the boat. I got to see Alcatraz Island, the view of the city and dissapointed not to be able to catch Angel Island. Good thing we got some gifts after we got off the bus b/c after the cruise we had to get on the bus right away to go to China town. China town was interesting to see. We had dinner at this place that the tour guide recomend and it sucks. The service was horrible and they mess up my food but i ate a little bit of it so they're were like okay you can just eat that and i was like it's okay, and i was hungry and i would feel kind of bad for them. After that dinner, we walk around and this Japanese lady join us also and for dinner too b/c she was by herself and she sat next to me on the bus. after dinner we went on the bus and drove almost an hour to finally a nice 4 star hotel. Nice rest room with nice shower and stuff to use with a nice view and a lot of channel on T.V. We got up at 6:15 and went on the bus around 7. We get to go see this garden where there a weird rode that i can't really describe but all it is, is just flowers. After the garden we got som Dim Sum and this Chinese restuarant. It took awhile for the lady to come around with the food but the Dim Sum was good and decent price. After that it was just the ride home. Drove for 2 hours and stop at a pit stop to have lunch. Had some Taco Bell and some ice cream. When we were almost home, 40 minutes away from our last stop. The bus engine stop and we had to sit in the freeway for 2hrs and it was freaking HOT!!!!! Details. People I sit next 2. Day one: someone wife for like 30 mintutes then change bus and sat next to one of the tour guide.. Day two: sat next to a Japanese lady that was nice. Day three: sat next to this teenage punk that was older than me. People in the bus: The majority of the people were asian except for 5 out of 50. There was some tall mo fo asian people. Sleep at: First night was at this crappy motel that was kind da nasty but it's okay. Second night was at a nice hotel that was very clean. Third night was at my sister husband mother house, there was an extra room. Things I ate: First day: Dannish food, cold roasted beef, rocky road fudge, then a buffet. Second day: Breakfast at yosemite, egg, potatoes and bacon. a hot dog in the cruise and ginger ale. Then later at a chinese restaurant that had bad service. Third day: Dim Sum for breakfast with tea and later Taco Bell quesadilla and one taco. Overall it was a great experience. Tiring",0,0.0
"The Twits is a humorous children's book written by Roald Dahl and illustrated by Quentin Blake. It was written in 1979, and first published by Jonathan Cape in 1980. The story features The Twits (Mr. and Mrs. Twit), a spiteful, idle, unkempt couple who continuously play nasty practical jokes on each other to amuse themselves, and exercise their wickedness on their monkeys. The Twits was adapted for the stage in November 2007.[1] Dahl's disgust at beards was the inspiration for Mr. Twit. As he stated, he penned The Twits in an effort to ""do something against beards"".[2] His biographer Michael Rosen recalls the first time the pair met, Dahl leant across to Rosen's son Joe and said of his father's beard: ""It's probably got this morning's breakfast in it. And last night's dinner. And old bits of rubbish, any old stuff that he's come across. You might even find a bicycle wheel in it.""[2] In 2003, The Twits was listed at number 81 in The Big Read, a BBC survey of the British public of the top 200 novels of all time.[3] In 2012, the titular Twits appeared on a Royal Mail commemorative postage stamp.[4] The idea of The Twits was triggered by Dahl's desire to 'do something against beards', because he had an acute hatred of them. The first sentence of the story is, 'What a lot of hairy-faced men there are around nowadays.' A hideous, vindictive, spiteful married couple known as the Twits live together in a brick house without windows. They continuously play nasty practical jokes on each other out of hatred for each other. They also keep a family of pet monkeys, the Muggle-Wumps. The Twits, who are retired circus trainers, are trying to create the first upside-down monkey circus. They will always demand the monkeys stand on their heads for hours on end. Mr. Twit uses glue called Hugtight in hopes of catching birds for Mrs. Twit to make into a bird pie. The monkeys try to warn the birds before they land on the tree, but the English-speaking birds do not understand the monkeys' African language. Once a week the Roly-Poly bird flies to visit the monkeys, to secretly save the birds by acting as an interpreter of languages. On a Tuesday night, a group of four boys see the ladder next to this tree and they decided to walk up into it, not thinking or knowing that glue was on it. On the Wednesday morning Mr Twit sees that the boys have scared them away. Out of rage Mr Twit charges at them, but they get away. Mr Twit tries several times to catch the birds and, tired of not getting anywhere, Mr. Twit decides to go buy guns with his wife to kill them. The Muggle-Wumps come up with an idea to use Mr. Twit's glue to attach the Twits' furniture to their ceiling, while the birds come up with an idea to smear glue on the Twits' heads. Shocked, the Twits rush into their home and see the resulting mess. Mr. Twit suggests that they stand on their heads so that they are 'the right way up'. The Roly-Poly bird then offers to fly the Muggle-Wumps all the way back to Africa, and the Muggle-Wumps escape. Hours later both Mr and Mrs. Twit are putting all their weight down on the heads and catch the 'Dreaded Shrinks'- with their bodies compressing 'downwards.' Their head shrinks into their neck, their necks shrink into their bodies, their bodies shrink into their legs, and their legs shrink into their feet. Their feet shrink into nothing but two pairs of shoes and old clothes. Mr. and Mrs. Twit are then nowhere to be seen. Their absence is promptly celebrated by everyone. Mr. Twit is a wicked person, having hair that covers his entire face, with the exception of his forehead, eyes, and nose. His hair (which he falsely believes makes him appear 'wise and grand' but is widely agreed by everyone else makes him look like a twit), is unkempt. Because he never washes it, his beard holds scraps of food stuck there while he ate, including tinned sardines, Stilton cheese, and corn flakes. Occasionally, he licks these scraps out and eats them when he is hungry. As part of a plan to make Mrs. Twit feel that she is shrinking, he slowly extended her chair and cane until she was convinced that she was getting shorter. Instead of wiping his mouth with a cloth, Mr. Twit simply wipes it on his sleeve. Mr. Twit is a drinker with a fondness for beer; he even drinks alcohol at breakfast. He is known to be very quiet when he is plotting. He and his wife mistreat their monkeys, the Muggle-Wumps. They have kept Muggle-Wump and his family locked up in a cage in the garden. The dreaded shrinks demolished Mr. Twit into nothing. All that was left of the Twits was two bundles of old clothes, two pairs of shoes and a walking stick. Mrs. Twit is the hideously ugly, menacing wife of Mr. Twit. She is said to have quite a nice face once, but her ugly thoughts began to show on her face until she was so ugly, you couldn't bear to look at her. She takes advantage of her glass eye to play practical jokes in revenge against her husband, and demonstrates multiple acts of cruelty and viciousness throughout the story: the main reason behind her use of a walking cane was as a weapon against innocent children and animals, she participates in the torment of the couple's pet monkeys the Muggle-Wumps, and she once served Mr. Twit a lunch of worms disguised as spaghetti. Albeit, while she frequently demonstrates acts of stupidity, she has also exhibited intelligence: she managed to manoeuvre her way out of being carried off into the sky by balloons by chewing through several of the strings and landing safely on the ground. Aside from this, she is portrayed",0,0.0

"Sitters my visitors in this case proved to be; but not in the sense I should have preferred. However, there was nothing at first to indicate that they might not have come for a portrait. The gentleman, a man of fifty, very high and very straight, with a moustache slightly grizzled and a dark grey walking-coat admirably fitted, both of which I noted professionally—I don’t mean as a barber or yet as a tailor—would have struck me as a celebrity if celebrities often were striking. It was a truth of which I had for some time been conscious that a figure with a good deal of frontage was, as one might say, almost never a public institution. A glance at the lady helped to remind me of this paradoxical law: she also looked too distinguished to be a “personality.” Moreover one would scarcely come across two variations together. Neither of the pair spoke immediately—they only prolonged the preliminary gaze which suggested that each wished to give the other a chance. They were visibly shy; they stood there letting me take them in—which, as I afterwards perceived, was the most practical thing they could have done. In this way their embarrassment served their cause. I had seen people painfully reluctant to mention that they desired anything so gross as to be represented on canvas; but the scruples of my new friends appeared almost insurmountable. Yet the gentleman might have said “I should like a portrait of my wife,” and the lady might have said “I should like a portrait of my husband.” Perhaps they were not husband and wife—this naturally would make the matter more delicate. Perhaps they wished to be done together—in which case they ought to have brought a third person to break the news. “We come from Mr. Rivet,” the lady said at last, with a dim smile which had the effect of a moist sponge passed over a “sunk” piece of painting, as well as of a vague allusion to vanished beauty. She was as tall and straight, in her degree, as her companion, and with ten years less to carry. She looked as sad as a woman could look whose face was not charged with expression; that is her tinted oval mask showed friction as an exposed surface shows it. The hand of time had played over her freely, but only to simplify. She was slim and stiff, and so well-dressed, in dark blue cloth, with lappets and pockets and buttons, that it was clear she employed the same tailor as her husband. The couple had an indefinable air of prosperous thrift—they evidently got a good deal of luxury for their money. If I was to be one of their luxuries it would behove me to consider my terms. “Ah, Claude Rivet recommended me?” I inquired; and I added that it was very kind of him, though I could reflect that, as he only painted landscape, this was not a sacrifice. The lady looked very hard at the gentleman, and the gentleman looked round the room. Then staring at the floor a moment and stroking his moustache, he rested his pleasant eyes on me with the remark: “He said you were the right one.” “I try to be, when people want to sit.” “Yes, we should like to,” said the lady anxiously. “Do you mean together?” My visitors exchanged a glance. “If you could do anything with _me_, I suppose it would be double,” the gentleman stammered. “Oh yes, there’s naturally a higher charge for two figures than for one.” “We should like to make it pay,” the husband confessed. “That’s very good of you,” I returned, appreciating so unwonted a sympathy—for I supposed he meant pay the artist. A sense of strangeness seemed to dawn on the lady. “We mean for the illustrations—Mr. Rivet said you might put one in.” “Put one in—an illustration?” I was equally confused. “Sketch her off, you know,” said the gentleman, colouring. It was only then that I understood the service Claude Rivet had rendered me; he had told them that I worked in black and white, for magazines, for story-books, for sketches of contemporary life, and consequently had frequent employment for models. These things were true, but it was not less true (I may confess it now—whether because the aspiration was to lead to everything or to nothing I leave the reader to guess), that I couldn’t get the honours, to say nothing of the emoluments, of a great painter of portraits out of my head. My “illustrations” were my pot-boilers; I looked to a different branch of art (far and away the most interesting it had always seemed to me), to perpetuate my fame. There was no shame in looking to it also to make my fortune; but that fortune was by so much further from being made from the moment my visitors wished to be “done” for nothing. I was disappointed; for in the pictorial sense I had immediately _seen_ them. I had seized their type—I had already settled what I would do with it. Something that wouldn’t absolutely have pleased them, I afterwards reflected. “Ah, you’re—you’re—a—?” I began, as soon as I had mastered my surprise. I couldn’t bring out the dingy word “models”; it seemed to fit the case so little. “We haven’t had much practice,” said the lady. “We’ve got to _do_ something, and we’ve thought that an artist in your line might perhaps make something of us,” her husband threw off. He further mentioned that they didn’t know many artists and that they had gone first, on the off-chance (he painted views of course, but sometimes put in figures—perhaps I remembered), to Mr. Rivet, whom they had met a few years before at a place in Norfolk where he was sketching. “We used to sketch a little ourselves,” the lady hinted. “It’s very awkward, but we absolutely _must_ do something,” her husband went on. “Of course, we’re not so _very_ young,” she admitted,",0,0.0
"be rich is a luxurious sensation--the more so when you have plumbed the depths of hard-up-ness as a Fleet Street hack, a picker-up of unconsidered pars, a reporter, an unappreciated journalist--all callings utterly inconsistent with one's family feeling and one's direct descent from the Dukes of Picardy. When my Aunt Dorcas died and left me seven hundred a year and a furnished house in Chelsea, I felt that life had nothing left to offer except immediate possession of the legacy. Even Mildred Mayhew, whom I had hitherto regarded as my life's light, became less luminous. I was not engaged to Mildred, but I lodged with her mother, and I sang duets with Mildred, and gave her gloves when it would run to it, which was seldom. She was a dear good girl, and I meant to marry her some day. It is very nice to feel that a good little woman is thinking of you--it helps you in your work--and it is pleasant to know she will say ""Yes"" when you say ""Will you?"" But, as I say, my legacy almost put Mildred out of my head, especially as she was staying with friends in the country just then. Before the first gloss was off my new mourning I was seated in my aunt's own armchair in front of the fire in the dining-room of my own house. My own house! It was grand, but rather lonely. I _did_ think of Mildred just then. The room was comfortably furnished with oak and leather. On the walls hung a few fairly good oil-paintings, but the space above the mantelpiece was disfigured by an exceedingly bad print, ""The Trial of Lord William Russell,"" framed in a dark frame. I got up to look at it. I had visited my aunt with dutiful regularity, but I never remembered seeing this frame before. It was not intended for a print, but for an oil-painting. It was of fine ebony, beautifully and curiously carved. I looked at it with growing interest, and when my aunt's housemaid--I had retained her modest staff of servants--came in with the lamp, I asked her how long the print had been there. ""Mistress only bought it two days afore she was took ill,"" she said; ""but the frame--she didn't want to buy a new one--so she got this out of the attic. There's lots of curious old things there, sir."" ""Had my aunt had this frame long?"" ""Oh yes, sir. It come long afore I did, and I've been here seven years come Christmas. There was a picture in it--that's upstairs too--but it's that black and ugly it might as well be a chimley-back."" I felt a desire to see this picture. What if it were some priceless old master in which my aunt's eyes had only seen rubbish? Directly after breakfast next morning I paid a visit to the lumber-room. It was crammed with old furniture enough to stock a curiosity shop. All the house was furnished solidly in the early Victorian style, and in this room everything not in keeping with the ""drawing-room suite"" ideal was stowed away. Tables of papier-mach and mother-of-pearl, straight-backed chairs with twisted feet and faded needlework cushions, firescreens of old-world design, oak bureaux with brass handles, a little work-table with its faded moth-eaten silk flutings hanging in disconsolate shreds: on these and the dust that covered them blazed the full daylight as I drew up the blinds. I promised myself a good time in re-enshrining these household gods in my parlour, and promoting the Victorian suite to the attic. But at present my business was to find the picture as ""black as the chimley-back;"" and presently, behind a heap of hideous still-life studies, I found it. Jane the housemaid identified it at once. I took it downstairs carefully and examined it. No subject, no colour were distinguishable. There was a splodge of a darker tint in the middle, but whether it was figure or tree or house no man could have told. It seemed to be painted on a very thick panel bound with leather. I decided to send it to one of those persons who pour on rotting family portraits the water of eternal youth--mere soap and water Mr. Besant tells us it is; but even as I did so the thought occurred to me to try my own restorative hand at a corner of it. My bath-sponge, soap, and nailbrush vigorously applied for a few seconds showed me that there was no picture to clean! Bare oak presented itself to my persevering brush. I tried the other side, Jane watching me with indulgent interest. The same result. Then the truth dawned on me. Why was the panel so thick? I tore off the leather binding, and the panel divided and fell to the ground in a cloud of dust. There were two pictures--they had been nailed face to face. I leaned them against the wall, and the next moment I was leaning against it myself. For one of the pictures was myself--a perfect portrait--no shade of expression or turn of feature wanting. Myself--in a cavalier dress, ""love-locks and all!"" When had this been done? And how, without my knowledge? Was this some whim of my aunt's? ""Lor', sir!"" the shrill surprise of Jane at my elbow; ""what a lovely photo it is! Was it a fancy ball, sir?"" ""Yes,"" I stammered. ""I--I don't think I want anything more now. You can go."" She went; and I turned, still with my heart beating violently, to the other picture. This was a woman of the type of beauty beloved of Burne Jones and Rossetti--straight nose, low brows, full lips, thin hands, large deep luminous eyes. She wore a black velvet gown. It was a full-length portrait. Her arms rested on a table beside her, and her head on her hands; but her face was turned full forward, and her eyes met those of the spectator bewilderingly. On the table by her were compasses",0,0.0

"caractère en apparence si merveilleux, que l'esprit se sentait incapable de les admettre comme pures coïncidences. De pareils sentiments (car les demi-croyances dont je parle n'ont jamais la parfaite énergie de la _pensée_), de pareils sentiments ne peuvent être que difficilement comprimés, à moins qu'on n'en réfère à la science de la chance, ou, selon l'appellation technique, au calcul des probabilités. Or, ce calcul est, dans son essence, purement mathématique; et nous avons ainsi l'anomalie de la science la plus rigoureusement exacte appliquée à l'ombre et à la spiritualité de ce qu'il y a de plus impalpable dans le monde de la spéculation. Les détails extraordinaires que je suis invité à publier forment, comme on le verra, quant à la succession des époques, la première branche d'une série de _coïncidences_ à peine imaginables, dont tous les lecteurs retrouveront la branche secondaire ou finale dans l'assassinat récent de Mary Cecilia Rogers, à New-York. Lorsque, dans un article intitulé _Double assassinat dans la rue Morgue_, je m'appliquai, il y a un an à peu près, à dépeindre quelques traits saillants du caractère spirituel de mon ami le chevalier C. Auguste Dupin, il ne me vînt pas à l'idée que j'aurais jamais à reprendre le même sujet. Je n'avais pas d'autre but que la peinture de ce caractère, et ce but se trouvait parfaitement atteint à travers la série bizarre de circonstances faites pour mettre en lumière l'idiosyncrasie de Dupin. J'aurais pu ajouter d'autres exemples, mais je n'aurais rien prouvé de plus. Toutefois, des événements récents, ont, dans leur surprenante évolution, éveillé brusquement dans ma mémoire quelques détails de surcroît, qui garderont ainsi, je présume, quelque air d'une confession arrachée. Après avoir appris tout ce qui ne m'a été raconté que récemment, il serait vraiment étrange que je gardasse le silence sur ce que j'ai entendu et vu, il y a déjà longtemps. Après la conclusion de la tragédie impliquée dans la mort de madame L'Espanaye et de sa fille, le chevalier Dupin congédia l'affaire de son esprit, et retomba dans ses vieilles habitudes de sombre rêverie. Très-porté, en tout temps, vers l'abstraction, son caractère l'y rejeta bien vite; et continuant à occuper notre appartement dans le faubourg Saint-Germain, nous abandonnâmes aux vents tout souci de l'avenir, et nous nous assoupîmes tranquillement dans le présent, brodant de nos rêves la trame fastidieuse du monde environnant. Mais ces rêves ne furent pas sans interruption. On devine facilement que le rôle joué par mon ami dans le drame de la rue Morgue n'avait pas manqué de faire impression sur l'esprit de la police parisienne. Parmi ses agents, le nom de Dupin était devenu un mot familier. Le caractère simple des inductions par lesquelles il avait débrouillé le mystère n'ayant jamais été expliqué au préfet, ni à aucun autre individu, moi excepté, il n'est pas surprenant que l'affaire ait été regardée comme approchant du miracle, ou que les facultés analytiques du chevalier lui aient acquis le crédit merveilleux de l'intuition. Sa franchise l'aurait sans doute poussé à désabuser tout questionneur d'une pareille erreur; mais son indolence fut cause qu'un sujet dont l'intérêt avait cessé pour lui depuis longtemps ne fut pas agité de nouveau. Il arriva ainsi que Dupin devint le fanal vers lequel se tournèrent les yeux de la police; et en mainte circonstance, des efforts furent faits auprès de lui par la préfecture pour s'attacher ses talents. L'un des cas les plus remarquables fut l'assassinat d'une jeune fille nommée Marie Roget. Cet événement eut lieu deux ans environ après l'horreur de la rue Morgue. Marie, dont le nom de baptême et le nom de famille frapperont sans doute l'attention par leur ressemblance avec ceux d'une jeune et infortunée marchande de cigares, était la fille unique de la veuve Estelle Roget. Le père était mort pendant l'enfance de la fille, et depuis l'époque de son décès jusqu'à dix-huit mois avant l'assassinat qui fait le sujet de notre récit, la mère et la fille avaient toujours demeuré ensemble dans la rue Pavée-Saint-André[2], madame Roget y tenant une pension bourgeoise, avec l'aide de Marie. Les choses allèrent ainsi jusqu'à ce que celle-ci eût atteint sa vingt-deuxième année, quand sa grande beauté attira l'attention d'un parfumeur qui occupait l'une des boutiques du rez-de-chaussée du Palais-Royal, et dont la clientèle était surtout faite des hardis aventuriers qui infestent le voisinage. M. Le Blanc[3] se doutait bien des avantages qu'il pourrait tirer de la présence de la belle Marie dans son établissement de parfumerie; et ses propositions furent acceptées vivement par la jeune fille, bien qu'elles soulevassent chez madame Roget quelque chose de plus que de l'hésitation. Les espérances du boutiquier se réalisèrent, et les charmes de la brillante grisette donnèrent bientôt la vogue à ses salons. Elle tenait son emploi depuis un an environ, quand ses admirateurs furent jetés dans la désolation par sa disparition soudaine de la boutique. M. Le Blanc fut dans l'impossibilité de rendre compte de son absence, et madame Roget devint folle d'inquiétude et de terreur. Les journaux s'emparèrent immédiatement de la question, et la police était sur le point de faire une investigation sérieuse, quand un beau matin, après l'espace d'une semaine, Marie, en bonne santé, mais avec un air légèrement attristé, reparut, comme d'habitude, à son comptoir de parfumerie. Toute enquête, excepté celle d'un caractère privé, fut immédiatement arrêtée. M. Le Blanc professait une parfaite ignorance, comme précédemment. Marie et madame Roget répondirent à toutes les questions qu'elle avait passé la dernière semaine dans la maison d'un parent, à la campagne. Ainsi l'affaire tomba, et fut généralement oubliée; car la jeune fille, dans le but ostensible de se soustraire à l'impertinence de la curiosité, fit bientôt un adieu définitif au parfumeur, et alla chercher un abri dans la résidence de sa mère, rue Pavée-Saint-André. Il y avait à peu près cinq mois qu'elle était rentrée à la maison, lorsque ses amis furent alarmés par une soudaine et nouvelle disparition. Trois jours s'écoulèrent sans qu'on entendit parler d'elle. Le quatrième jour, on découvrit son",0,0.0
"The 2012 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship was the 126th edition of the GAA's premier inter-county Gaelic football tournament, played between 31 counties of Ireland (excluding Kilkenny who only take part in the hurling championship), London and New York.[1] The 2012 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final took place at Croke Park on 23 September 2012, with Donegal emerging victorious. Having reclaimed the Ulster Senior Football Championship with wins over Cavan, Derry, Tyrone and Down, they met and bet Kerry in the All-Ireland quarter-final, in what was widely considered the game of the Championship.[2] They then overcame Cork in the semi-final and Mayo in the final in Jim McGuinness's second season in charge, allowing team captain Michael Murphy to hold the Sam Maguire Cup aloft. Colm McFadden finished as the competition's top scorer and Karl Lacey was named the competition's best player. A total of 33 teams contested the championship. These included 31 teams from Ireland as well as London and New York. As in previous years, Kilkenny decided not to field a team. Ahead of the 2012 Championship, three referees joined the panel: Conor Lane of Banteer, Martin Higgins of Fermanagh and Barry Cassidy of Derry.[3] Sligo record their easiest ever championship win over New York. The All-Ireland Senior Football Championship of 2012 was run on a provincial basis as usual. It was a knockout tournament with pairings drawn at random in the respective provinces – there was no seeds. Each match was played as a single leg. If a match was drawn there was a replay. If that match ended in a draw a period of extra time was played; however, if both sides were still level at the end of extra time another replay would have taken place. Quarter-finals: (3 matches) These were three matches between six of the Connacht teams drawn first. The three winning teams advanced to the semi-finals, while the three losing teams entered the All-Ireland qualifiers. Semi-finals: (4 matches) The winners of the three quarter-final games joined the other two Connacht teams to make up the semi-final pairings. The two winning teams advanced to the final, while the two losing teams entered the All-Ireland qualifiers. Final: (1 match) The winners of the two semi-finals contested this game. The winning team advanced to the All-Ireland quarter-final, while the losing team entered the All-Ireland qualifiers. Preliminary round: (3 matches) These were three matches between six of the Leinster teams drawn first. The three winning teams advanced to the quarter-finals, while the three losing teams entered the All-Ireland qualifiers. Quarter-finals: (4 matches) The winners of the three preliminary round games joined the other five Leinster teams to make up four quarter-final pairings. The four winning teams advanced to the semi-finals, while the four losing teams entered the All-Ireland qualifiers. Semi-finals: (2 matches) The four winners of the quarter-finals made up the semi-final pairings. The two winning teams advanced to the final, while the two losing teams entered the All-Ireland qualifiers. Final: (1 match) The winners of the two semi-finals contested this game. The winning team advanced to the All-Ireland quarter-final, while the losing team entered the All-Ireland qualifiers. Quarter-finals: (2 matches) These were to be two matches between four of the Munster teams drawn first. The two winning teams advanced to the semi-finals, while the two losing teams entered the All-Ireland qualifiers. Semi-finals: (4 matches) The winners of the two quarter-final games joined the other two Munster teams to make up the semi-final pairings. The two winning teams advanced to the final, while the two losing teams entered the All-Ireland qualifiers. Final: (1 match) The winners of the two semi-finals contested this game. The winning team advanced to the All-Ireland quarter-final, while the losing team entered the All-Ireland qualifiers. Preliminary round: (1 match) This was a lone match between two of the Ulster teams drawn first. The winning team advanced to the quarter-finals, while the losing team entered the All-Ireland qualifiers. Quarter-finals: (4 matches) The winners of the lone preliminary round game joined the other seven Ulster teams to make up four quarter-final pairings. The four winning teams advanced to the semi-finals, while the four losing teams entered the All-Ireland qualifiers.

The two winning teams advanced to the final, while the two losing teams entered the All-Ireland qualifiers. Final: (1 match) The winners of the two semi-finals contested this game. The winning team advanced to the All-Ireland quarter-final, while the losing team entered the All-Ireland qualifiers. The qualifiers gave teams defeated in the provincial championships another chance at winning the All-Ireland title. Round 1 (8 matches): the sixteen teams who failed to reach a provincial semi-final entered the qualifiers at this stage (New York do not compete). An open draw was made to determine the eight match pairings. Round 2 (8 matches): the eight teams who failed to progress from their provincial semi-finals entered the qualifiers at this stage. They were paired with the eight winners from round 1 of the qualifiers. An open draw was made to determine the eight match pairings. Round 3 (4 matches): the eight teams from round 2 of the qualifiers were paired against each other. An open draw was made to determine the four match pairings. Round 4 (4 matches): the four teams who lost their provincial finals entered the qualifiers at this stage. They were paired with the four winners from round 3 of the qualifiers. An open draw was made to determine the four match pairings. The four winners advanced to the All-Ireland quarter-finals. Quarter-finals: (4 matches) the four teams from round 4 of the qualifiers were paired against the four provincial winners. An open draw was made to determine the four match pairings.

"In psychology, affordance is what the environment offers the individual. In design, affordance has a narrower meaning, it refers to possible actions that an actor can readily perceive. American psychologist James J. Gibson coined the term in his 1966 book, The Senses Considered as Perceptual Systems,[1] and it occurs in many of his earlier essays.[2] His best-known definition is from his 1979 book, The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception: The affordances of the environment are what it offers the animal, what it provides or furnishes, either for good or ill. ... It implies the complementarity of the animal and the environment.[3] The word is used in a variety of fields: perceptual psychology, cognitive psychology, environmental psychology, criminology, industrial design, human–computer interaction (HCI), interaction design, user-centered design, communication studies, instructional design, science, technology and society (STS), sports science and artificial intelligence. Gibson developed the concept of affordance over many years, culminating in his final book, The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception[4] in 1979. He defined an affordance as what the environment provides or furnishes the animal. Notably, Gibson compares an affordance with an ecological niche emphasizing the way niches characterize how an animal lives in its environment. The key to understanding affordance is that it is relational and characterizes the suitability of the environment to the observer, and so, depends on their current intentions and their capabilities. For instance, a set of steps which rises 1 metre (3 ft) high does not afford climbing to the crawling infant, yet might provide rest to a tired adult or the opportunity to move to another floor for an adult who wished to reach an alternative destination. This notion of intention/needs is critical to an understanding of affordance, as it explains how the same aspect of the environment can provide different affordances to different people, and even to the same individual at another point in time. As Gibson puts it, “Needs control the perception of affordances (selective attention) and also initiate acts.”[5] Affordances were further studied by Eleanor J. Gibson, wife of James J. Gibson, who created her theory of perceptual learning around this concept. Her book, An Ecological Approach to Perceptual Learning and Development, explores affordances further. Gibson's is the prevalent definition in cognitive psychology. According to Gibson, humans tend to alter and modify their environment so as to change its affordances to better suit them. On his view, humans change the environment to make it easier to live in (even if making it harder for other animals to live in it): to keep warm, to see at night, to rear children, and to move around. This tendency to change the environment is natural to humans, and Gibson argues that it is a mistake to treat the social world apart from the material world or the tools apart from the natural environment. He points out that manufacturing was originally done by hand as a kind of manipulation. Gibson argues that learning to perceive an affordance is an essential part of socialization. The theory of affordances introduces a ""value-rich ecological object"".[4] Affordances cannot be described within the value-neutral language of physics, but rather introduces notions of benefits and injuries to someone. An affordance captures this beneficial/injurious aspect of objects and relates them to the animal for whom they are well/ill-suited. During childhood development, a child learns to perceive not only the affordances for the self, but also how those same objects furnish similar affordances to another. A child can be introduced to the conventional meaning of an object by manipulating which objects command attention and demonstrating how to use the object through performing its central function.[6] By learning how to use an artifact, a child “enters into the shared practices of society” as when they learn to use a toilet or brush their teeth.[6] And so, by learning the affordances, or conventional meaning of an artifact, children learn the artifact's social world and further, become a member of that world. Anderson, Yamagishi and Karavia (2002) found that merely looking at an object primes the human brain to perform the action the object affords.[7] In 1988, Donald Norman appropriated the term affordances in the context of Human–Computer Interaction to refer to just those action possibilities that are readily perceivable by an actor. This new definition of ""action possibilities"" has now become synonymous with Gibson's work, although Gibson himself never made any reference to action possibilities in any of his writing.[8] Through Norman's book The Design of Everyday Things,[9] this interpretation was popularized within the fields of HCI, interaction design, and user-centered design. It makes the concept dependent not only on the physical capabilities of an actor, but also on their goals, beliefs, and past experiences. If an actor steps into a room containing an armchair and a softball, Gibson's original definition of affordances allows that the actor may throw the chair and sit on the ball, because this is objectively possible. Norman's definition of (perceived) affordances captures the likelihood that the actor will sit on the armchair and throw the softball. Effectively, Norman's affordances ""suggest"" how an object may be interacted with. For example, the size, shape, and weight of a softball make it perfect for throwing by humans, and it matches their past experience with similar objects, as does the shape and perceptible function of an armchair for sitting. The focus on perceived affordances is much more pertinent to practical design problems[why?], which may explain its widespread adoption. Norman later explained that this restriction of the term's meaning had been unintended, and in his 2013 update of The Design of Everyday Things, he added the concept ""signifiers"". In the digital age, designers were learning how to indicate what actions were possible on a smartphone's touchscreen, which didn't have the physical properties that Norman intended to describe when he used the word ""affordances"". Designers needed a word to describe what they were doing, so they chose affordance. What alternative did they have? I decided to provide a better answer: signifiers. Affordances determine what actions are",0,0.0

He ate the starfish and the garfish, and the crab and the dab, and the plaice and the dace, and the skate and his mate, and the mackereel and the pickereel, and the really truly twirly-whirly eel. All the fishes he could find in all the sea he ate with his mouth--so! Till at last there was only one small fish left in all the sea, and he was a small 'Stute Fish, and he swam a little behind the Whale's right ear, so as to be out of harm's way. Then the Whale stood up on his tail and said, 'I'm hungry.' And the small 'Stute Fish said in a small 'stute voice, 'Noble and generous Cetacean, have you ever tasted Man?' 'No,' said the Whale. 'What is it like?' 'Nice,' said the small 'Stute Fish. 'Nice but nubbly.' 'Then fetch me some,' said the Whale, and he made the sea froth up with his tail. 'One at a time is enough,' said the 'Stute Fish. 'If you swim to latitude Fifty North, longitude Forty West (that is magic), you will find, sitting _on_ a raft, _in_ the middle of the sea, with nothing on but a pair of blue canvas breeches, a pair of suspenders (you must _not_ forget the suspenders, Best Beloved), and a jack-knife, one shipwrecked Mariner, who, it is only fair to tell you, is a man of infinite-resource-and-sagacity.' So the Whale swam and swam to latitude Fifty North, longitude Forty West, as fast as he could swim, and _on_ a raft, _in_ the middle of the sea, _with_ nothing to wear except a pair of blue canvas breeches, a pair of suspenders (you must particularly remember the suspenders, Best Beloved), _and_ a jack-knife, he found one single, solitary shipwrecked Mariner, trailing his toes in the water. (He had his mummy's leave to paddle, or else he would never have done it, because he was a man of infinite-resource-and-sagacity.) Then the Whale opened his mouth back and back and back till it nearly touched his tail, and he swallowed the shipwrecked Mariner, and the raft he was sitting on, and his blue canvas breeches, and the suspenders (which you _must_ not forget), _and_ the jack-knife--He swallowed them all down into his warm, dark, inside cupboards, and then he smacked his lips--so, and turned round three times on his tail. But as soon as the Mariner, who was a man of infinite-resource-and-sagacity, found himself truly inside the Whale's warm, dark, inside cupboards, he stumped and he jumped and he thumped and he bumped, and he pranced and he danced, and he banged and he clanged, and he hit and he bit, and he leaped and he creeped, and he prowled and he howled, and he hopped and he dropped, and he cried and he sighed, and he crawled and he bawled, and he stepped and he lepped, and he danced hornpipes where he shouldn't, and the Whale felt most unhappy indeed. (_Have_ you forgotten the suspenders?) [Illustration: THIS is the picture of the Whale swallowing the Mariner with his infinite-resource-and-sagacity, and the raft and the jack-knife _and_ his suspenders, which you must _not_ forget. The buttony-things are the Mariner's suspenders, and you can see the knife close by them. He is sitting on the raft, but it has tilted up sideways, so you don't see much of it. The whity thing by the Mariner's left hand is a piece of wood that he was trying to row the raft with when the Whale came along. The piece of wood is called the jaws-of-a-gaff. The Mariner left it outside when he went in. The Whale's name was Smiler, and the Mariner was called Mr. Henry Albert Bivvens, A.B. The little 'Stute Fish is hiding under the Whale's tummy, or else I would have drawn him. The reason that the sea looks so ooshy-skooshy is because the Whale is sucking it all into his mouth so as to suck in Mr. Henry Albert Bivvens and the raft and the jack-knife and the suspenders. You must never forget the suspenders.] So he said to the 'Stute Fish, 'This man is very nubbly, and besides he is making me hiccough. What shall I do?' 'Tell him to come out,' said the 'Stute Fish. So the Whale called down his own throat to the shipwrecked Mariner, 'Come out and behave yourself. I've got the hiccoughs.' 'Nay, nay!' said the Mariner. 'Not so, but far otherwise. Take me to my natal-shore and the white-cliffs-of-Albion, and I'll think about it.' And he began to dance more than ever. 'You had better take him home,' said the 'Stute Fish to the Whale. 'I ought to have warned you that he is a man of infinite-resource-and-sagacity.' [Illustration: HERE is the Whale looking for the little 'Stute Fish, who is hiding under the Door-sills of the Equator. The little 'Stute Fish's name was Pingle.

"Traveling through rural China was an adventure like no other. I had always been fascinated by the country's rich history and diverse culture, and I wanted to explore the lesser-known parts of China that often get overshadowed by the bustling cities. Little did I know that this trip would test my limits and open my eyes to a whole new world.

My first challenge was transportation. Unlike the well-connected cities, getting around rural China proved to be quite a task. The train network was limited, and the buses were often overcrowded and uncomfortable. I remember waiting for hours at a dusty bus stop, hoping that a bus would come by to take me to my next destination. But it was all part of the experience, and I learned to embrace the unpredictable nature of travel in rural China.

Accommodations were another challenge. In major cities, finding a place to stay was never an issue, but in rural areas, it was a different story. The options were limited, with mostly small guesthouses or homestays available. These accommodations were basic but charming, giving me a glimpse into the local way of life. I stayed in cozy rooms with traditional Chinese decorations, and the hospitality of the hosts made up for any lack of luxury.

Communication was also a barrier. English was not widely spoken in rural China, and my Mandarin skills were limited. I relied on hand gestures, smiles, and the occasional translation app to communicate with the locals. Despite the language barrier, I found that people were incredibly friendly and willing to help. They would go out of their way to assist me, whether it was giving me directions or recommending local attractions to visit.

One of the highlights of my trip was experiencing the local culture. In rural China, traditions and customs are deeply rooted in daily life. I had the opportunity to witness traditional festivals, such as the Dragon Boat Festival, where villagers gathered to race dragon boats and enjoy delicious rice dumplings. The atmosphere was vibrant and filled with excitement. I also visited ancient temples and historical sites, basking in the rich history that surrounded me.

Food was an integral part of my travel experience in rural China. Each region had its own culinary specialties, and I enjoyed indulging in the local cuisine. From spicy Sichuan dishes to hearty dumplings in Shandong, my taste buds were constantly delighted. One unforgettable culinary experience was dining at a rural farmhouse, where I savored a homemade feast prepared with fresh ingredients from the surrounding fields. It was a truly authentic taste of rural China.

Interacting with the locals was one of the most rewarding aspects of my journey. The people of rural China were incredibly warm and welcoming. I met farmers who invited me into their homes to sample homemade tea and share stories of their daily lives. I played with children in the village square, their laughter echoing through the air. These encounters reminded me of the beauty of human connection, transcending language and cultural barriers.

Traveling in rural China was not without its challenges, but it was an experience that I will cherish forever. It allowed me to see a different side of China, one that is often overshadowed by the modernity of the cities. I learned the art of patience, embracing the unpredictable and finding joy in the simplest of moments. The vast landscapes, rich culture, and warm hospitality of rural China left an indelible mark on my heart, reminding me of the beauty that lies beyond the beaten path.",1,0.0

"The snowfall was relentless, blanketing the remote village in a thick layer of white. Savely, the sexton, watched as the snowflakes danced in the air, swirling and twirling, creating an ethereal beauty that belied the harsh conditions outside. The wind howled through the narrow streets and rattled the windows of the small cottages, sending shivers down Savely's spine. He tightened his coat around himself, determined to stay warm despite the bitter cold.

In the heart of the village, Savely and his wife, Masha, huddled together in their modest cottage. The fire crackled in the hearth, casting flickering shadows against the walls, providing the only source of warmth and light in the room. The storm had cut off all communication with the outside world, isolating the village from civilization. It had been days since they had seen anyone other than their fellow villagers, and the thought of being trapped in this remote place sent a chill down Savely's spine.

As the night wore on, the tension in the cottage grew palpable. The arrival of the postman earlier that afternoon had stirred up a whirlwind of suspicion and fear. The villagers muttered amongst themselves, their superstitious beliefs taking hold of their minds. They believed that the postman brought not only letters and packages but also ill fortune and misfortune. Some even whispered that he was a harbinger of death.

Savely could feel the weight of these whispered suspicions pressing down on him. He peered out of the window, trying to catch a glimpse of the postman's retreating silhouette, but the snowfall obscured his view. Fear gnawed at his heart, and he couldn't help but wonder if there was any truth to the villagers' suspicions.

Masha, sensing her husband's unease, reached out to touch his hand. Her touch was warm and comforting, offering a respite from the cold grip of fear that had settled around Savely's heart. ""We mustn't let our imaginations get the better of us, my love,"" she said softly, her voice carrying a hint of determination. ""We will weather this storm together, just as we have weathered every storm that has come our way.""

Savely nodded, his grip on her hand tightening. He knew that she was right. They had faced hardships before, and they had always emerged stronger. But the isolation of the village, coupled with the supernatural beliefs of the villagers, made it difficult to shake off the unease that settled over the couple.

Days turned into nights, and nights turned into days as the storm raged on. The snow outside grew deeper, encasing the village in an icy embrace. The tension amongst the villagers continued to escalate. Whispers of suspicion filled the air, and glances were exchanged with trepidation.

One evening, as darkness fell, a loud knock resounded through the village. The sound echoed through the quiet streets, causing hearts to skip a beat. Savely and Masha exchanged worried glances, their thoughts mirroring each other. Could it be the postman, returning once again to this desolate place?

Savely steeled himself and walked towards the door, his footsteps heavy with apprehension. He took a deep breath and, with trembling hands, turned the doorknob. The door creaked open, revealing a figure cloaked in white, snowflakes clinging to his coat. It was the postman.

The villagers gathered around, their faces a mix of curiosity and fear. The postman's presence was like a flickering candle amidst a sea of darkness—their only connection to the outside world. Savely watched as the postman handed out letters, his hands shaking from the cold. The tension in the air eased slightly as the villagers were reminded of their lives beyond the snowbound village.

As the postman prepared to leave, Masha approached him, her voice barely above a whisper. ""Is it true? Are you a harbinger of death?"" she asked, her eyes searching for the truth in his gaze.

The postman smiled, a weary smile that carried the weight of many stories. ""No, my dear,"" he replied softly. ""I am merely a conduit of news, a bringer of tidings from the outside world. I carry no ill will; I am just a traveler on this snowy road.""

With those words, Masha's fear lifted. She turned to face the villagers, her voice filled with conviction. ""We must cast away these baseless suspicions,"" she declared. ""We are a community, bound together by more than just fear and superstition. Let us come together, support each other, and find strength in unity.""

The villagers listened, their faces slowly transforming from suspicion to understanding. They realized the power of their collective spirit, the strength that could be harnessed when they put aside their mistrust. And so, in that remote village, amidst the swirling snow and chilling winds, the bonds of community were strengthened, and the weight of suspicion was replaced by the warmth of trust.",1,-1.0
"Dear Senator Kerry, My name is ._________. I am a __ year old woman who lives in Lexington, Kentucky. I am physically handicapped, and, up until this electoral year I had a firm belief nothing I truly did, even in voting, would make any difference in the outcome of the election or in the nation. Many years ago I lost the faith in due process and am only now beginning to think, just maybe, things could be different in this nation. Although I am a registered Republican, in the main election you will have my vote. You will also have the vote of my husband. Senator Kerry, whether or not you personally receive this letter is a moot point: I understand someone will read this letter, and perhaps, pass its contents along to you. In so saying this I would like to point out a few items I am deeply concerned about and would like to voice them to you at this time. I am a physically handicapped individual. I have been physically handicapped my entire life. Despite my handicap I worked and then had to take disability because of even further decreased health. Because of this I am on Social Security Disability and therefore on Medicare. Because of this I cannot work, even though there are times during the warm months of the summer there is a possibility of a short span of work opportunity for any extra income, because I need my benefits and my husband and I cannot afford my medical expenses without Medicare and the disability income. Even if I am unable to work, the Medicare system is so shot at this time it does not assist in paying much of my medical bills. My husband, is working as a custodian at a local university even though he has a degree in Applied Mechanical Science in Computer Animated Design Drafter because this was the only place he was able to secure work and provide me with medical insurance, as well as himself. He sent out his resumes for over a year, so secured this position to keep our household fed and our bills paid. We are members of the working poor. We are not even in the Middle Class income bracket. Whether or not we are members of the Middle Class, I believe everyone’s voice could be heard, so am lifting mine. 1) We need a system overhaul of Medicare to help each and every individual, not just the elderly. 2) We need an employment opportunity in order to further the security of our household and reach toward the American Dream which has been illusive despite how hard we work. 3) The minimum wage needs to be increased in the Commonwealth of Kentucky, as well as the nation. Some examples of how this could be done is with alternative energy sources such as thermal, hydro-electric, solar, wind turbines, and the legalization of hemp as a potential alternative to our fossil fuels. This would also help our environment tremendously as there is over 5000 different uses, currently known. Everything that is made by petroleum can be made by hemp, including concrete, clothing, plastic, and paper. The use of hemp would help save our trees as you yourself said “trees are the cathedrals of nature.” We should indeed try to save them and thus ourselves. There are other plants than hemp that grow faster than trees and could be used more readily. And yes, my husband and I both know hemp is different from marijuana. 4) Public transportation and tourist trains would also help the economy. Better bike trails and transportation for handicapped individuals would also help the economy of Kentucky as well as the nation itself. 5) Better pay for our firefighters and policemen and women should also be more formalized. In Lexington, Kentucky the policemen and women are still working even though their pay is far below the national limit. Because of their selflessness, my husband and I have even more respect and admiration for them. 6) Both my husband and I believe natural medicines and herbal supplements should have a better standard upon them. My husband and I have had to look to natural medicines because of the high cost of medicines. Many doctors I have had to see have discounted the natural medicines and herbal supplements, even though they help and have been used for thousands of years. In this nation natural medicines have been scoffed at as a New Age fad or health nuts, when in reality all medicine are based on these plants. It is a shame many children are prescribed Prozac® when perhaps St. John’s Wort would be just as effective, or just talking to the child and having parental guidance and love. Another example is my mother, whom I recently lost due to Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Congestive Heart Failure and kidney failure. During her long struggle with these horrible diseases and having to watch her slowly wither and die before me, there were many drugs she could have used to help extend her life and make the quality of her life better, but they were unavailable due to cost. She had to take special shots called Procrit® to help her gain strength and morphine for pain, but it took away her appetite and sometimes made her very sick to her stomach, so therefore she had to have another medicine to settle her stomach, which took away her appetite; we then had to give her another medicine to help her get her stomach. The medicine to help her regain her appetite grew too expensive so we discovered Elder Tonic which would help her get her appetite back. Still, sometimes when she ate she was still very sick to her stomach. A nurse said there was a medicine that could help with her appetite called Merinol® that would help increase her appetite, settle her stomach, and perhaps help with pain. This drug was approximately $900 for one month’s supply which neither",0,0.0
"Hey there, folks! It's been a minute since we last had a good old chat about my personal escapades and all the shenanigans I've been getting into lately. So come on, grab a snack, and get comfy, because I've got some updates and reflections to share with y'all!

Let's start with something that has been both terrifying and exhilarating all at once: driving lessons. Now, picture this: me, a grown adult, gripping that steering wheel like my life depends on it, while my instructor's calm voice echoes in my ears, saying things like, ""Ease on the brakes, gently now."" Yeah... let's just say it's been quite the experience. But I must admit, there's something liberating about being in control of a vehicle and cruising down the road, even if it's at a snail's pace. Although, I'm not sure my instructor would agree with the ""cruising"" part, considering how often he slaps his hand on the dashboard in panic. But hey, practice makes perfect, right?

Speaking of practicing, let me tell you about my delightful niece. Spending time with her is like having a crash course in energy and imagination. That little bundle of joy can make even the simplest activities feel like a wacky adventure. We've taken to having our own tea parties in the garden, complete with imaginary friends and mismatched teacups. And let me just say, my niece is a master chef when it comes to the art of making mud pies. Although, I'll admit, I wasn't exactly thrilled when she tried to serve me one. But hey, it's the thought that counts, right? Spending time with her reminds me to embrace the joy and playfulness in life, even when things get a little messy.

Now, let's shift gears and talk about my gym adventures. Okay, maybe ""adventures"" is a bit of a stretch. I mean, I'm no fitness guru or anything. In fact, I might be the person who spends more time staring at the equipment, trying to decipher what each contraption does, than actually using it. But hey, I'm there, sweating and giving it my best shot. And that's what counts, right? Plus, the gym provides an endless supply of people-watching entertainment. There's always that one person who seems a little too enthusiastic about their workout routine or the guy who always forgets to bring a towel and ends up using his t-shirt instead. It's like a comedy show, I tell you. Who needs Netflix when you've got a front-row seat to the human circus?

Now, let me take you on a trip down under, to the land of kangaroos, koalas, and farewell dinners. Yep, I recently had the pleasure of attending a farewell dinner in Melbourne. Now, you may think that farewell dinners are generally somber affairs, filled with tears and bittersweet goodbyes. But not this one. Oh no! Picture a group of rowdy friends, stuffing their faces with delicious food, and reminiscing about all the crazy moments we've shared together. There were jokes, laughter, and even a questionable karaoke rendition of ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" that may or may not have made Freddie Mercury turn in his grave. It was a night filled with love, laughter, and a few too many glasses of wine. Good times, my friends, good times.

And there you have it, folks. A little glimpse into my world and the crazy adventures I've been embarking on. Whether it's surviving driving lessons, embracing the chaos with my niece, trying to decipher gym equipment, or attending rowdy farewell dinners, life's been a whirlwind of laughter and learning. And honestly, I wouldn't have it any other way. So until next time, stay curious, stay adventurous, and don't be afraid to take the wheel (literally or metaphorically). Catch you on the flip side!",1,0.0
"peculiar taste, but it was alcoholic, and one got used to it. In the kitchen McCullough's wife was getting Sunday dinner on the new inductor stove, still marvelling at its convenience--back on the farm they had cooked with wood. The two children were playing in and out of the house. His neighbors, Henry Watts from across the street, and Pete Tallant from next door, had been helping him with the windows, and now they were helping him with the bottle. They were discussing the native question. In a way, this was the beginning of the riot. ""It's not that I got anything against them, in their place,"" Henry Watts said. ""Their place just ain't in an Earthman's town, that's all. They keep crowding in, first thing you know there'll be more natives than there is Earthmen, then you just watch out. They're snotty enough already in their sly way, you let them get the upper hand once, mark my word, it won't be safe for a woman to walk down the street."" ""Yeah, I guess so,"" McCullough said. He was really not much interested. His people were from the flats upriver from Knakvik, a long-settled country where the first colonists had been brought two generations before to form the nucleus of an agricultural community. He had never seen more than half a dozen native Centaurans until he came down to Knakvik to work on the spaceport the new federal colonial government was building, and it was not his nature to worry about problems which did not directly concern him. Mostly, he liked to mind his own business, it was characteristic of McCullough that his friends came to visit him at his house, he did not go to visit them. ""What the government ought to do,"" Watts said, ""it ought to take the whole bunch and round them up and put them away on a reservation somewhere. You can't civilize a grayskin, they ain't even human to start with, so why try?"" ""Nuts,"" Pete Tallant said. Where Watts was a redneck miner and construction worker; and McCullough a farmer picking up a little easy money on a temporary job; Tallant was an intellectual, a dark restive young Earthman working his way around to see how Earth's far colonies looked. Watts' yapping irritated him, but there was no point in arguing against that sort of brainless conviction, he knew. He stared gloomily off at the mountains across the river, rising clean and snow-capped above the shanties and garbage piles of the transient workers who had overflowed the city to camp on the flats along the river; thinking: Just over a hundred years ago this planet was first discovered by men. Less than sixty years ago the first colonists were brought here. They came to a brand-new planet, almost as naked as the day they were born--two hundred pounds per colonist, including their own weight--with a free hand to build a new world as they pleased. And already the same old pattern, hate and distrust and envy, greed and oppression. How many men on Centaurus II? Perhaps a hundred thousand. How many native Centaurans? Perhaps five million, on a planet larger than Earth. But not enough room for both-- ""You think I'm prejudiced,"" Watts said heavily, the need of the frontiersman to justify his opinions before the cosmopolite rankling in his voice. ""Well, I ain't. I just know those buggers, that's all. You greenhorns come out here from Earth, you figure you got an answer to everything, just because we don't have the schooling you got, we're a bunch of fools. Ain't that right, John?"" ""Yeah, I guess,"" McCullough said absently. The next thing to do, he thought, now that they had inductor power from the central station, was to get running water in the house. Plastic bubbles and tents and shanties and hauling water from the pump were well enough for bums and single men, but a family man might as well be building a decent home while he was about it. There would always be rental value in a good house here in town, especially with the new spaceport and the government moving here; and later, when the kids had to go to high school, it would be handy. Some day, too, he would be retiring, turning the farm over to Jimmy, he and Mary would need a place to live then. ""The old ones ain't so bad,"" Watts said. ""They know their place, and they remember what happened at Artillery Bluff. But some of these young bucks, especially the smart-alecky kind the government has been sending to school--"" He shook his head forebodingly. ""Nuts,"" Tallant said wearily. ""Let's talk about something we can all be stupid about, huh? Women or baseball or something."" Watts flushed. ""_I_ know what I'm talking about now, and I didn't get it out of books, either, I've lived with the buggers. You greenhorns read all this sob stuff in the high-brow magazines back on Earth about the noble Centaurans, and you figure we're a bunch of jerks because we don't slobber all over them too. Noble Centaurans! Jesus! Dirty, sneaking non-humans, that's what."" He lifted the bottle and drank deeply, tilting back his head and letting his eyes rove. ""There,"" he said abruptly. ""There's your noble Centaurans, look at 'em!"" A group of natives were coming up the alley--in Port Knakvik, natives did not walk in the street--shuffling along with downcast eyes. They were a small gray-skinned people, roughly humanoid, viviparous but not mammalian. There were five males followed half a dozen steps behind by a female carrying an infant on her hip. ""You see that _kish_ there with her _fotin_?"" Watts asked. ""Lemme show you something, you probably wouldn't believe this if I told you, these grayskins are just like animals, they got no decency at all."" He stood up and waved an arm in a beckoning gesture. ""Hey, you _kish_, come over here,"" he called. The female Centauran paused uncertainly, looking at him",0,0.0
"Baldy and I were sitting in the backyard, enjoying a cold beer on a hot summer day, when I finally mustered up the courage to confide in him about the frustrations I was having with my marriage. I took a deep breath and let it out slowly before I started pouring my heart out to him.

""You know, Baldy, sometimes I feel like I'm living in the shadow of my own wife,"" I confessed, taking a sip of my beer. ""Santa has become so dominant in our relationship, and it's starting to weigh on me.""

Baldy leaned back in his chair, his brow furrowed with concern. ""What do you mean, Webb? Can you give me an example?""

""Well,"" I paused, searching for the right words to explain. ""It feels like Santa is always making decisions for both of us, without even considering my opinion. Whether it's about where we're going on vacation, what we're having for dinner, or even how we're spending our weekends, it seems like I don't have much say anymore.""

Baldy nodded sympathetically. ""I can understand how that would make you feel frustrated and powerless. Marriage is supposed to be a partnership, after all.""

""Exactly, Baldy,"" I replied, relief washing over me as he validated my feelings. ""I feel like I've lost my voice in this relationship. It's like Santa has taken over, and I'm just expected to follow along without question.""

Baldy scratched his chin thoughtfully. ""Have you talked to Santa about how you're feeling? Communication is key in any relationship, you know.""

I sighed, taking another sip of my beer. ""I've tried, Baldy. But every time I bring it up, she either dismisses my concerns or accuses me of being too controlling. It's like I can't win.""

Baldy's eyes narrowed, his expression becoming more serious. ""Webb, it sounds like there might be some power struggles going on within your marriage. It's important to remember that power dynamics can shift over time, especially as we grow and change as individuals.""

I nodded, appreciating Baldy's insight. ""You're right, Baldy. Maybe it's time for me to take a step back and evaluate my own role in this dynamic. Maybe I've been allowing Santa to take charge because it's easier than standing up for myself.""

Baldy smiled encouragingly. ""That's a good start, Webb. Remember, a healthy relationship is an equal partnership, where both partners have a voice and feel valued. Maybe it's time to assert yourself and communicate your needs more clearly.""

I sighed, feeling a mix of apprehension and determination. ""You're right, Baldy. It's time for me to have an open and honest conversation with Santa. I need to express my feelings and desires, without fear of being labeled as controlling.""

Baldy raised his beer in a toast. ""Here's to finding your voice, Webb. May your conversation with Santa bring about a new understanding and a healthier balance in your marriage.""

I clinked my beer against his, a glimmer of hope shining in my eyes. ""Cheers, Baldy. Thanks for being there for me. I feel better already, knowing I have your support.""

As we sat there, sipping our beers and enjoying each other's company, I felt a renewed sense of determination. I knew that addressing the power struggles within my marriage would be challenging, but with Baldy's advice and support, I was ready to take that step. It was time to reclaim my voice and work towards a more balanced and fulfilling relationship with Santa.",1,0.0
"They were friends in a friendship closer than brotherhood. Nello was a little Ardennois,--Patrasche was a big Fleming. They were both of the same age by length of years, yet one was still young, and the other was already old. They had dwelt together almost all their days; both were orphaned and destitute, and owed their lives to the same hand. It had been the beginning of the tie between them, their first bond of sympathy; and it had strengthened day by day, and had grown with their growth, firm and indissoluble, until they loved one another very greatly. Their home was a little hut on the edge of a little village,--a Flemish village a league from Antwerp, set amidst flat breadths of pasture and corn-lands, with long lines of poplars and of alders bending in the breeze on the edge of the great canal which ran through it. It had about a score of houses and homesteads, with shutters of bright green or sky-blue, and roofs rose-red or black and white, and walls whitewashed until they shone in the sun like snow. In the centre of the village stood a windmill, placed on a little moss-grown slope; it was a landmark to all the level country round. It had once been painted scarlet, sails and all, but that had been in its infancy, half a century or more earlier, when it had ground wheat for the soldiers of Napoleon; and it was now a ruddy brown, tanned by wind and weather. It went queerly by fits and starts, as though rheumatic and stiff in the joints from age, but it served the whole neighborhood, which would have thought it almost as impious to carry grain elsewhere, as to attend any other religious service than the mass that was performed at the altar of the little old gray church, with its conical steeple, which stood opposite to it, and whose single bell rang morning, noon, and night with that strange, subdued, hollow sadness which every bell that hangs in the Low Countries seems to gain as an integral part of its melody. Within sound of the little melancholy clock almost from their birth upward, they had dwelt together, Nello and Patrasche, in the little hut on the edge of the village, with the cathedral spire of Antwerp rising in the northeast, beyond the great green plain of seeding grass and spreading corn that stretched away from them like a tideless, changeless sea. It was the hut of a very old man, of a very poor man,--of old Jehan Daas, who in his time had been a soldier, and who remembered the wars that had trampled the country as oxen tread down the furrows, and who had brought from his service nothing except a wound, which had made him a cripple. When old Jehan Daas had reached his full eighty, his daughter had died in the Ardennes, hard by Stavelot, and had left him in legacy her two-year-old son. The old man could ill contrive to support himself, but he took up the additional burden uncomplainingly, and it soon became welcome and precious to him. Little Nello--which was but a pet diminutive for Nicolas--throve with him, and the old man and the little child lived in the poor little hut contentedly. It was a very humble little mud-hut indeed, but it was clean and white as a sea-shell, and stood in a small plot of garden-ground that yielded beans and herbs and pumpkins. They were very poor, terribly poor,--many a day they had nothing at all to eat. They never by any chance had enough; to have had enough to eat would have been to have reached paradise at once. But the old man was very gentle and good to the boy, and the boy was a beautiful, innocent, truthful, tender-natured creature; and they were happy on a crust and a few leaves of cabbage, and asked no more of earth or Heaven; save indeed that Patrasche should be always with them, since without Patrasche where would they have been? For Patrasche was their alpha and omega; their treasury and granary; their store of gold and wand of wealth; their bread-winner and minister; their only friend and comforter. Patrasche dead or gone from them, they must have laid themselves down and died likewise. Patrasche was body, brains, hands, head, and feet to both of them: Patrasche was their very life, their very soul. For Jehan Daas was old and a cripple, and Nello was but a child; and Patrasche was their dog. A dog of Flanders,--yellow of hide, large of head and limb, with wolf-like ears that stood erect, and legs bowed and feet widened in the muscular development wrought in his breed by many generations of hard service. Patrasche came of a race which had toiled hard and cruelly from sire to son in Flanders many a century,--slaves of slaves, dogs of the people, beasts of the shafts and the harness, creatures that lived straining their sinews in the gall of the cart, and died breaking their hearts on the flints of the streets. Patrasche had been born of parents who had labored hard all their days over the sharp-set stones of the various cities and the long, shadowless, weary roads of the two Flanders and of Brabant. He had been born to no other heritage than those of pain and of toil. He had been fed on curses and baptized with blows. Why not? It was a Christian country, and Patrasche was but a dog. Before he was fully grown he had known the bitter gall of the cart and the collar. Before he had entered his thirteenth month he had become the property of a hardware-dealer, who was accustomed to wander over the land north and south, from the blue sea to the green mountains. They sold him for a small price, because he was so young. This man was a drunkard and a brute. The life of",0,0.0
"James Morrison is an English singer, songwriter, and guitarist who first burst onto the music scene in 2006 with his debut single ""You Give Me Something."" Born on August 13, 1984, in Rugby, Warwickshire, Morrison was influenced by his parents' diverse record collection. His mother enjoyed soul music, while his father favored folk and country. This exposure to different genres laid the foundation for Morrison's own musical style.

Morrison's journey as a musician began when his uncle Joe taught him a blues riff on the guitar. This sparked his interest in playing music, and he started performing as a teenager in his hometown. Later, Morrison moved to Cornwall, where he found acceptance and gained confidence in his musical abilities. He honed his skills by busking in a local pub called the Phoenix in Porth, Newquay. This experience allowed him to connect with audiences and refine his sound.

Despite facing early challenges, Morrison's distinct voice emerged as a result of a severe bout of whooping cough he experienced as a baby. Doctors predicted a grim outcome, giving him only a 30% chance of survival and fearing severe brain damage if he did survive. Morrison stopped breathing multiple times and required resuscitation. However, he defied the odds and found solace in music.

Throughout his career, Morrison has cited a number of artists as his influences. Stevie Wonder, Otis Redding, Van Morrison, and Al Green have all played a significant role in shaping his musical style. Morrison was particularly moved by Stevie Wonder's voice, which brought him to tears upon first hearing it. This passion for soulful music has been evident in his own work.

Morrison's big break came in 2006 with the release of his debut single, ""You Give Me Something."" The song achieved worldwide success, reaching No. 2 in the Netherlands and No. 5 in the UK. It also became a hit in Europe, Australia, Japan, and even Iran. His debut album, Undiscovered, which was released the same year, received positive reviews and debuted at the top of the UK Albums Chart. By the end of 2006, the album had sold over 1 million copies worldwide, establishing Morrison as the best-selling male solo artist in the UK that year.

Following his debut album's success, Morrison released his second album, Songs for You, Truths for Me, in 2008. The album featured the top 10 singles ""You Make It Real"" and ""Broken Strings,"" a collaboration with Nelly Furtado. It entered the top five in the UK and topped the Irish Albums Chart. Morrison's music continued to resonate with audiences, with subsequent singles such as ""Wonderful World"" and ""The Pieces Don't Fit Anymore"" also finding success in the UK and the Netherlands.

Alongside his solo career, Morrison has written songs for other artists. He has collaborated with a range of musicians, including Demi Lovato, Olly Murs, Kelly Clarkson, and Clay Aiken. Morrison's songwriting abilities have proven to be versatile, as he even penned a song for Italian singer Marco Carta, which debuted at number one on Italy's chart.

Morrison's success has taken him to various music festivals and television shows. He has performed at prestigious events like the Royal Variety Performance and made appearances on popular TV shows such as Jimmy Kimmel Live! in the United States. In 2007, he was nominated for three BRIT Awards and won the Best British Male Solo Artist category, solidifying his place as a respected and celebrated artist.

James Morrison's music career showcases his talent as a singer, songwriter, and guitarist. With his distinct voice and soulful sound, he continues to captivate audiences worldwide. His journey, from a small town in Warwickshire to international success, serves as an inspiration to aspiring musicians and highlights the power of perseverance and passion in the face of adversity.",1,0.0
"Astrology is often used as a tool to gain insights into individual personalities, but it can also provide valuable information about the compatibility between two individuals in a relationship. By analyzing the astrological aspects between two people, we can gain a deeper understanding of their potential strengths and challenges.

One important factor to consider in astrological compatibility is the Sun sign. The Sun represents our core self and our basic personality traits. When two individuals have compatible Sun signs, they are likely to have a natural understanding of each other and share similar values and interests. However, if their Sun signs clash, there may be some challenges to overcome.

For example, let's consider a relationship between a Taurus and a Leo. Taurus is an earth sign, represented by the bull, while Leo is a fire sign, symbolized by the lion. Earth signs are practical, grounded, and value stability, while fire signs are passionate, energetic, and crave excitement. The Taurus partner may find the Leo's need for constant stimulation and attention overwhelming, while the Leo may feel restricted by the Taurus's desire for routine and stability. However, if they are able to find a balance and appreciate each other's differences, they can create a harmonious and balanced relationship.

Another aspect to consider is the Moon sign, which represents our emotional needs and instincts. Compatibility between Moon signs is crucial for emotional connection and understanding in a relationship. For instance, if one partner has a Moon in a water sign, such as Cancer, and the other has a Moon in an air sign, like Aquarius, they may struggle to connect emotionally. Water signs are intuitive and emotional, while air signs are rational and intellectual. The Cancer partner may feel frustrated by the Aquarius partner's tendency to detach emotionally, while the Aquarius partner may find the Cancer partner too clingy or overly sensitive. However, with open communication and understanding, they can learn to appreciate and support each other's emotional needs.

Additionally, Venus, the planet of love and relationships, is another important aspect to consider when analyzing compatibility. Venus reveals how individuals express affection and what they find attractive in a partner. When two people have compatible Venus signs, they are likely to have similar love languages and share common values in relationships. However, if their Venus signs clash, there may be some conflicts in how they express love and affection.

For example, let's consider a partnership between a Libra and a Scorpio. Libra is ruled by Venus, representing love and harmony, while Scorpio is ruled by Mars and Pluto, symbolizing passion and intensity. Libra seeks balance and harmony in relationships, while Scorpio is known for their deep intensity and desire for emotional connection. The Libra partner may find the Scorpio partner's intensity overwhelming or too demanding, while the Scorpio partner may view the Libra partner as too indecisive or superficial. Nonetheless, if they can learn to appreciate and respect each other's differences, they can create a powerful and transformative relationship.

It is important to note that while astrology can provide insights into compatibility, it should not be the sole determinant of a relationship's success. Every individual is unique, and their personal experiences, values, and emotional intelligence also play significant roles in the dynamics of a relationship. Astrology simply offers a framework to better understand the potential strengths and challenges between two people.

In conclusion, astrology can provide valuable insights into the compatibility between two individuals in a relationship. By analyzing their Sun signs, Moon signs, and Venus signs, we can gain a deeper understanding of their potential strengths and challenges. However, it is essential to approach astrology as a tool for self-discovery and growth rather than a definitive guide for relationship success. Open communication, understanding, and a willingness to compromise are key ingredients for a successful and fulfilling relationship, regardless of the astrological aspects.",1,0.0
"The Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis (DART) buoy system is a crucial component in tsunami detection and warning systems worldwide. Designed to operate in the deep ocean, these buoys provide real-time data on oceanic conditions, enabling scientists and authorities to accurately detect and report the presence of tsunamis. This informative and technical analysis delves into the purpose, components, and functionality of the DART buoy system, highlighting its significance in tsunami early warning systems.

The primary purpose of the DART buoy system is to detect tsunamis in the open ocean and provide immediate and accurate information to coastal communities, allowing them to respond swiftly and minimize the potential damage caused by these devastating natural disasters. By accurately monitoring pressure changes in the ocean, DART buoys can detect tsunami waves that may be barely noticeable in deep water. The data collected by these buoys is transmitted in real-time to the Tsunami Warning Centers (TWCs), which can then issue timely alerts to potentially affected regions.

At the heart of the DART buoy system lies a network of buoys strategically located across the world's oceans. Each buoy is equipped with a set of essential components that work together to detect and report tsunamis. The key components of a DART buoy system include a seafloor pressure sensor, an acoustic modem, a surface buoy, and a satellite communication system.

The seafloor pressure sensor, installed on the ocean floor, measures the changes in water pressure caused by tsunami waves. This sensor is designed to withstand the extreme conditions of the deep ocean, including high pressures and harsh temperatures. The pressure data is continually collected and transmitted to the surface buoy via an underwater cable.

The surface buoy, buoyant enough to float on the water's surface, houses the critical communication and data processing equipment. It acts as a relay station, receiving pressure data from the seafloor sensor through the underwater cable. The buoy then processes and packages the data for transmission to the Tsunami Warning Centers via satellite communication.

The acoustic modem plays a crucial role in the DART buoy system as it enables communication between the seafloor sensor and the surface buoy. It utilizes sound waves to transmit data through the water column, ensuring reliable and efficient transmission even in the challenging deep-ocean environment.

The satellite communication system allows the DART buoy to send the processed data to the Tsunami Warning Centers in real-time. By leveraging satellite technology, the buoys can transmit data to the centers regardless of their distance from land, ensuring the timely delivery of crucial information.

The functionality of the DART buoy system is highly dependent on the continuous monitoring and analysis of the data it collects. Tsunami Warning Centers around the world closely monitor the incoming data, looking for significant changes in water pressure that could indicate the presence of a tsunami. When such changes are detected, the centers utilize advanced analysis techniques to determine the magnitude, location, and potential impact of the tsunami. They then issue timely alerts to potentially affected coastal communities and authorities, enabling them to initiate evacuation procedures or take appropriate precautions.

The DART buoy system has been deployed in various regions prone to earthquakes and tsunamis worldwide, including the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, and the Mediterranean Sea. The expansion of the system to different regions has significantly improved global tsunami detection and warning capabilities, enhancing the overall preparedness and response to these potentially catastrophic events.

Despite the system's immense value, concerns have arisen over potential budget cuts proposed by the Trump administration in recent years. These cuts could hinder the maintenance, expansion, and operation of the DART buoy system, potentially compromising the effectiveness of tsunami early warning systems. The importance of continued investment in this critical infrastructure cannot be overstated, as it directly contributes to public safety and mitigates the devastating impact of tsunamis on coastal communities.

In conclusion, the DART buoy system is a vital component of tsunami early warning systems worldwide. By detecting and reporting changes in water pressure caused by tsunamis, these buoys provide real-time data that enables scientists and authorities to issue timely warnings to potentially affected regions. Equipped with a seafloor pressure sensor, acoustic modem, surface buoy, and satellite communication system, the DART buoy system is designed to operate in the deep ocean and withstand the challenging conditions present in these environments. The continued investment and maintenance of this system are crucial to ensuring the safety of coastal communities and minimizing the impact of tsunamis.",1,0.0
"Shame they don't match what I'm wearing now. This morning has been eventful. I was coming back from walking the dogs in the jungle like weather of crofton (92degrees at 7am and 300% humidity)when I noticed a man with a spray can on a stick in my neighborhood. He was pretending that he was invisible...but the little blue lines he was drawing all over my neighbors lawns were quite visible. And quite confusing. So I blew his cover and spoke directly to him while reading the 'Annarundel County' on his shirt.""what'cha marking for?"" ...he looked at me (you can see me?)(yes, I can see you)(and now I'm talking to you)...""we're dropping new electric lines""...I looked back down the sidewalk from where he had come and saw the big blue line savagely drawn across Dominick new lawn of sod. I imagined him later that day laying crying in his ugly short sleeved oxford and outdated briefcase in that grass that he had brought up from little unrelated squares into one beautiful seamless rectangle. I should look into therapy groups for him today while online today at work. I looked back at the man with the spray stick. This was alot like having a rabid raccoon in the neighborhood.Quietly destructive. I put the dogs inside - gave them cheese slices as fast as the humidity would allow me to unwrap them. And then went upstairs to change into another outfit to wear to work. I had totally sweated through the one I was currently wearing and Connor snotted all over my right knee while on the walk -so rather than have to look at those little dots all day while in meetings and wonder if anyone knew exactly how disgusting their supposed team leader was...I changed. While changing I noticed [through the shades that I can see out of but of course no-one can see in through][need to change the shades in the bedroom]I noticed that the spray can man was now nearing my front door. I hurriedly ran downstairs followed by idiotic dogs that assumed that my new outfit meant we would be going on yet another walk. I could fart and they would rush the door.You have to love that optimism. So I get outside and it seems that Todd ( I don't know his name - he said it too fast) and I had to have words for like 25 minutes while the dogs barked at him through the window for ruining their possibility of a second walk. The gist of it was he, Todd, wanted to make a blue mark right through my petunias...thus indicating that further activity was yet to come in that area. I explained that I did not want his blue mark - or any other activity happening in my garden and that i would stay there all day to defend my bulbs and flowers. He pretended that he was invisible again and moved onto the neighbors yard. I took this to mean that there was now an 'implied' blue mark in my garden that would be explained somewhere else to a man with a shovel, no glasses and no sense of how long it takes to get mail order Smith and Hawkins bulbs to feel comfortable in new soil.( a real fucking long time). So I followed Todd down the sidewalk like a bad odor and presented him with questions and some possible solutions. Did they have to dig where they put the line? ""yes."" would I be able to dig that ditch for them? ""no."" why? blah blah blah - this went on for another 10 minutes...so it was decided that I would come home and dig my own unofficial ditch through my front yard and I would hope that they would see this as a sign to ""lay lines here - cause it's ready to go and all tulip bulbs have been moved to the relative safety of the backyard"" and not just be stupid and dig another hole right along side of it endangering my lilies.You just know that is going to happen, don't you? Well once I was fully covered in sweat again from being outdoors in the elements fighting the good bulb fight...I got my 35 bags from inside and got in the car to go to work. It was at this point that I was a victim of marketing. As I waited at the red light to leave Crofton..I spied that picture of the iced coffee hanging outside the Dunkin Donuts. This sign has gotten me so many time. I NEEDED an iced coffee ...(and maybe a donut)(for being such a good sport wit hthe electrical avenger.)So I cued up in the drive through and had my money all ready to go (not that I knew that a large iced coffee and one glazed donut would cost $3.51) I even had the penny. Just as I was second in line in the drive through - I felt something on my neck. It was moving. This triggered alot of things to happen simultaneously...my left hand slapped my neck very hard, I screamed, my right foot shot to the floor, my right foot being on the gas pedal for some reason it cause my vehicle to slam into the back of this very nice new blue suburban that was currently infront of me. I saw their little arm reaching for the drivers window to the drive through window only to be slung back like a little dollies arm. Thankfully not ever getting the coffee that spilled directly out of the window and onto the ground. (pause for breathing) alot happened really quickly there. My eyes were very wide and there was a dead garden beetle smushed all over my left hand. And I was kinda locked into my car cause of where I was in the drive through. Insert about 15 minutes of repetitive apologies and some police being happily called to a donut shop (what luck!). And then I",0,0.0
"Algebraic geometry is a branch of mathematics that studies geometric objects defined by polynomial equations. One of the most fundamental concepts in algebraic geometry is the notion of a projective space. Projective spaces are important in various areas of mathematics, including algebraic topology and complex analysis. In scheme theory, a generalization of algebraic geometry, the Proj construction is used to construct objects with properties similar to projective spaces and projective varieties.

The Proj construction is a categorical construction that associates a scheme to a graded ring. Given a graded ring S, the Proj construction produces a scheme denoted by Proj S. The idea behind this construction is to glue affine pieces together in a suitable way to obtain a globally defined object.

To understand the Proj construction, let's first consider the case where S is a polynomial ring. In this case, Proj S can be thought of as the set of all homogeneous prime ideals of S that do not contain the irrelevant ideal generated by the homogeneous polynomials of degree zero. Geometrically, these prime ideals correspond to points in projective space. The homogeneous prime ideals are defined by equations homogenizing the equations defining affine pieces.

Now, let's consider the general case where S is an arbitrary graded ring. The construction of Proj S proceeds in a similar way. We start by considering the homogeneous prime ideals of S and define Proj S as the set of all such prime ideals that do not contain the irrelevant ideal. However, in this general setting, the homogeneous prime ideals do not necessarily correspond to points. Instead, they correspond to closed subschemes of Proj S.

The topology on Proj S is defined by considering the sets D(f), where f is a homogeneous element of positive degree in S. The set D(f) consists of all homogeneous prime ideals of S that do not contain f. Geometrically, D(f) corresponds to an open subset of Proj S, and the collection of all such open subsets forms a basis for the topology on Proj S.

To complete the construction of Proj S, we need to define the structure sheaf on Proj S. The structure sheaf is a sheaf of rings that assigns to every open subset U of Proj S a ring denoted by O(U). Intuitively, the sections of O(U) can be thought of as functions defined on U. The structure sheaf on Proj S is constructed by gluing together the structure sheaves on the affine pieces.

To define the structure sheaf on an affine piece, let's consider an element g in S of degree d. We can associate to g a graded S-module denoted by S_g. This module consists of all elements of S that are homogeneous of degree zero and are not contained in any prime ideal that contains g. The quasicoherent sheaf associated with S_g is denoted by O_U(g). The sections of O_U(g) over an open subset U of Proj S are given by the degree zero elements of S_g localized at U.

The structure sheaf on Proj S is obtained by gluing together the sheaves O_U(g) over all affine pieces U. The gluing is done by using the twisting sheaf, which is a sheaf of graded algebras denoted by O(1). The sections of O(1) over an open subset U are given by elements of degree one in S localized at U. The twisting sheaf plays a crucial role in defining the transition maps between different affine pieces.

In conclusion, the Proj construction in scheme theory provides a way to construct objects with properties similar to projective spaces and projective varieties. It involves gluing together affine pieces in a suitable way to obtain a globally defined object. The topology on Proj S is defined using the sets D(f), and the structure sheaf is constructed by gluing together the quasicoherent sheaves associated with graded modules. The twisting sheaf plays a crucial role in defining the transition maps between affine pieces. This construction is a powerful tool that allows for the study of projective geometry in a general setting.",1,0.0

"The sixteenth season of So You Think You Can Dance (SYTYCD), an American dance competition reality show on FOX, returned on June 3, 2019.[1] The series has won numerous awards since its debut in 2005, including eleven Emmy Awards for Outstanding Choreography, the most for any show.[2] This panel of judges again features series creator Nigel Lythgoe, as well as the return of ballroom dance champion and expert Mary Murphy. New to the panel are choreographer Laurieann Gibson and B-boy dancer/choreographer Dominic ""D-Trix"" Sandoval, who serve as the third and fourth judges during auditions and live shows.[3] Cat Deeley continues in her role as host for a fifteenth consecutive season, for which she has earned five Emmy Award nominations.[4] The grand prize is $250,000,[5][a] a cover article in Dance Spirit, and the title of ""America's Favorite Dancer"".[6] In the first five episodes, the Judges' Auditions featured about six full performances each along with the judges' critiques, as well as montages of other dancers.[7] From those auditions, a pool of eighty-three contestants,[b] who each earned a Golden Ticket advancing them to The Academy where they face, in the next episodes, six Academy Rounds that winnow down to the Top Ten—five women and five men—for the live shows.[7] In episode ten, and for the rest of the season, the live Studio Performance Shows showcase the finalists in solos, duets, and group numbers, as they vie to connect with viewers who vote for their favorites. The following week, at the end of the show, the two women and two men with the lowest vote totals will be up for elimination.[8] The judges decide which woman and man will be cut. On September 16, 2019, Bailey Muñoz was crowned ""America's Favorite Dancer"" and became the first b-boy to win the title in the show's history. A forty-stop tour featuring the Top Ten contestants and two All-stars started soon after the finale and ran until December 2019.[9] Madison Jordan, an eventual Top Six contestants, shared that she submitted her online video in January and was contacted a month later to in-person auditions.[10] Those auditions, for dancers ages eighteen to thirty, took place with producers in: New York on February 9, 2019; Dallas on February 12; and Los Angeles on February 23.[10][11] From these, approximately 130 dancers were chosen by the producers to audition in Hollywood in March before the panel of judges.[10][12] In addition to the new judges, the televised auditions have been revamped so instead of remote tryouts, the contestants come to the new SYTYCD Hollywood studio, outfitted with 120 cameras surrounding the stage, allowing the movement to be ""frozen"" in time, like bullet time.[13] Another change is the addition of a studio audience instead of being just the rest of auditioners and their supporters.[13] The five episodes of Judges' Auditions each featured about six full-length dance routines; with an introduction package about the contestant, critique, and vote from the judging panel. Only a few of those were excluded from moving to The Academy Rounds; the successful auditioners were given a ""Golden Ticket"" to the Academy. In addition, montages of auditions were also mixed in with the full ones, showing a mix of some voted through.[1] Some of the episodes were also themed; episode four featured various couple configurations including identical twin eighteen-year-old contemporary dancers Trent and Colton Edwards.[14] The Academy Rounds, filmed in April, started in episode six at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, California with the eighty-three contestants who made it through the Judges’ Auditions to get a Golden Ticket by excelling in a dance style of their choice.[10][7][c] Over three days they will go through four Choreography Rounds of The Academy; rehearsing new dance routines, from a professional choreographer, en masse for ninety minutes.[7] They then face the original four judges, in small groups, who can: pass them through; have them “dance for their lives”; or be cut from the competition.[7] Of those that started: approximately only one in four, or twenty (ten women, and ten men) will make it to the Top Twenty; and they will face The Final Cut, with only half (five women, and five men) going through to the Top Ten studio performance shows.[7] The four Choreography Rounds were: The Academy's first three rounds were shown in episode six.[7] Day One started with the Hip-hop Round, after which ten of the eighty-three dancers who started are cut, including Trent, one of the identical twins.[7] Day Two, the Ballroom Round cuts another fifteen people including: Colton, the other identical twin; and Sarah “Smac” McCreanor, a jazz dancer who wowed the judges as a comedic performer, but whose dancing was not at a high enough standard for the season.[7][16] Episode seven picks up in the middle of the Contemporary Round, where fifty-four dancers faced more cuts: including Jay Jackson, a contemporary dancer, and drag queen, who competed in drag last year but opted not to this time;[7][16] and Jarrod Tyler Paulson, who is in a romantic relationship with fellow contestant Madison Jordan, who advanced to the Top Twenty.[15] Day Three sees the forty-three remaining dancers take on The Group Round: the judges do their cuts by seeing the contestants grouped by their dance genres; eleven are cut, leaving thirty-three.[15] The Academy Week finishes with the last two Academy Rounds: The Solo Round features each of the remaining thirty-three contestants dancing a solo in their own genre, thirteen are cut, and the Top Twenty are revealed; while The Final Cut pares the dancers down to ten contestants.[15] In episode eight and nine, we will see The Final Cut coverage.[15] Each contestant will be paired with a SYTYCD All-Star, and choreographer, to rehearse a duet outside the contestant's genre.[15] In episode eight the Top Ten girls compete, the Top Ten boys compete the following week in episode nine.[17] The five contestants going through will be announced each night.[17] In order of appearance in episode eight:[d] Jonathan Platero Fik-Shun Lex Ishimoto Marko Germar Kiki Nyemchek Marko Germar Lex Ishimoto Fik-Shun Kiki Nyemchek",0,0.0
"I remember it like it was yesterday, that time in Cape Colony when me and my group of friends were facing some serious financial struggles. It was a remote and lonely part of the country, scattered with farms and always under the threat of Kaffirs. Life was tough, and we were desperate for a change in our fortunes.

We were a close-knit group of friends, having grown up together in this desolate place. We had dreams and aspirations just like anyone else, but reality had hit us hard. The farms were failing, and our families were barely making enough to survive. We knew we needed something to turn our luck around, but we had no idea where to start.

One evening, as we were gathered around a small campfire, nursing our frustrations, someone mentioned the haunted valley. It was said to be a place cursed by the spirits, and most people in the area avoided going near it. The mention of the haunted valley caught our attention, and we found ourselves intrigued and curious. Maybe, just maybe, this could be the stroke of luck we had been desperately waiting for.

As the days went by, the idea of exploring the haunted valley became more appealing. We had nothing to lose and everything to gain. We decided to put our fears aside and embark on this mysterious adventure. With a hodgepodge of supplies and a glimmer of hope, we set out on our journey.

The valley was as eerie as the stories claimed. The air was heavy with an unnatural silence, broken only by the rustling of leaves and the distant sound of unknown creatures. The path was treacherous, and we could feel the weight of anticipation on our shoulders. But we pressed on, driven by our desperation and desire for a change.

As we ventured deeper into the valley, strange things started happening. Shadows danced in the corner of our eyes, and whispers echoed through the dense foliage. We couldn't help but wonder if we had made a grave mistake. But we had come too far to turn back now.

Finally, we stumbled upon a hidden cave nestled deep within the valley. It emanated an otherworldly aura, and we knew this was the heart of the mystery we had sought. With trembling hands, we entered the cave, unaware of the life-altering events that awaited us.

Inside, we discovered an ancient treasure, gleaming with gold and jewels. It was a sight to behold, a fortune beyond our wildest dreams. We couldn't believe our luck; it felt like a miracle. We knew this was the change we had been hoping and praying for.

But as we celebrated our newfound wealth, a strange sensation washed over us. It was as if the spirits of the valley were watching, their presence growing stronger with each passing moment. Fear took hold of our hearts, and we knew we needed to leave, and quickly.

We hastily gathered the treasure and fled from the haunted valley, our hearts pounding with mixed emotions. We had achieved what we had set out to do, but at what cost? The weight of our actions and the fear of the unknown haunted us.

Back in our small village, we used the fortune we had stumbled upon to turn our lives around. We invested in the farms, improving irrigation systems, and purchasing new livestock. Slowly but surely, our fortunes began to change. Our families no longer struggled to make ends meet, and a sense of hope filled the air.

Yet, the memory of that haunted valley still lingers in the deepest corners of our minds. We often wonder what would have happened if we hadn't stumbled upon that treasure. Were the spirits truly watching over us? Or were they simply a figment of our desperate imagination?

One thing is for certain; that journey into the unknown changed us forever. It taught us the value of hope and friendship, and the importance of taking risks. We may never fully understand the mysteries of the haunted valley, but we will always be grateful for the stroke of luck that brought us prosperity in our darkest hour.",1,0.0
"Temple of the Dog was an American rock supergroup that formed in Seattle, Washington, in 1990. It was conceived by vocalist Chris Cornell of Soundgarden as a tribute to his friend, the late Andrew Wood, lead singer of the bands Malfunkshun and Mother Love Bone. The lineup included Stone Gossard on rhythm guitar, Jeff Ament on bass guitar (both ex-members of Mother Love Bone and later Pearl Jam), Mike McCready (later Pearl Jam) on lead guitar, and Matt Cameron (Soundgarden and later Pearl Jam) on drums. Eddie Vedder appeared as a guest to provide some lead and backing vocals and later became lead vocalist of Pearl Jam. Pearl Jam's debut album, Ten, was released four months after Temple of the Dog's only studio album. The band released its only album, the self-titled Temple of the Dog, in April 1991 through A&M Records. The recording sessions took place in November and December 1990 at London Bridge Studio in Seattle, Washington, with producer Rakesh ""Rick"" Parashar. Although earning praise from music critics at the time of its release, the album was not widely recognized until 1992, when Vedder, Ament, Gossard, and McCready had their breakthrough with Pearl Jam. Cameron would later join Pearl Jam, serving as drummer since 1998, following Soundgarden's initial break-up in 1997, making the five members of Pearl Jam after that point identical to the members of Temple of the Dog other than Chris Cornell. The band reformed and toured in 2016 to celebrate the 25th anniversary of their self-titled album. It was the only tour they ever undertook. Temple of the Dog was started by Soundgarden frontman Chris Cornell, who had been a roommate of Andrew Wood, the lead singer of Malfunkshun and Mother Love Bone.[1] Wood died on March 19, 1990, of a heroin overdose, the day Cornell got back from a tour.[2] As he went on to tour Europe a few days later, he started writing songs in tribute to his late friend.[1] The result was two songs, ""Reach Down"" and ""Say Hello 2 Heaven"", which he recorded as soon as he returned home from touring.[1] The recorded material was slow and melodic, musically different from the aggressive rock music of Soundgarden.[3] Cornell approached Wood's former Mother Love Bone bandmates Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament—who were still figuring out what to do after the death of their singer and lyricist—with the intention of releasing the songs as a single.[2] Ament described the collaboration as ""a really good thing at the time"" for Gossard and him that put them into a ""band situation where we could play and make music.""[2] The band's lineup was completed by the addition of Soundgarden (and later Pearl Jam) drummer Matt Cameron and future Pearl Jam lead guitarist Mike McCready, who was Gossard's childhood friend. They named themselves Temple of the Dog, a reference to a line in the lyrics of the Mother Love Bone song ""Man of Golden Words"".[1] The band started rehearsing ""Reach Down"", ""Say Hello 2 Heaven"", and other songs that Cornell had written on tour prior to Wood's death, as well as re-working some existing material from demos written by Gossard, Ament, and Cameron.[4] One such demo became a song for two bands, recorded as ""Footsteps"" by Pearl Jam and ""Times of Trouble"" by Temple of the Dog.[5] The idea of doing covers of Wood's solo material also came up, but was abandoned quickly, as the band felt it would make people (including Wood's close friends and relatives[1]) think they were ""exploiting his material.""[2] The release of a single was soon deemed a ""stupid idea"" by Cornell and dropped in favor of an EP or album.[1] The album was recorded in only 15 days, produced by the band themselves, along with Rick Parashar of London Bridge Studio.[1] Gossard described the recording process as a ""non-pressure-filled"" situation, as there were no expectations or pressure coming from the record company.[2] Eddie Vedder, who had flown up to Seattle from San Diego to audition to be the singer of Ament, Gossard, and McCready's new band, Mookie Blaylock (named for a basketball player, the band would later be renamed Pearl Jam), was at one of the Temple of the Dog rehearsals, and ended up providing backing vocals on a few songs,[6] with ""Hunger Strike"" becoming a duet between Cornell and Vedder. Cornell was still figuring out the vocals at practice, when Vedder stepped in and filled in the blanks, singing the low parts because he saw it was hard for Cornell.[7] As Cornell later described it: ""He sang half of that song not even knowing that I'd wanted the part to be there and he sang it exactly the way I was thinking about doing it, just instinctively.""[2][8] ""Hunger Strike"" became Temple of the Dog's breakout single. It was also Vedder's first featured vocal on a record.[9] In the 2011 documentary Pearl Jam Twenty, Vedder states: ""That was the first time I heard myself on a real record. It could be one of my favorite songs that I've ever been on — or the most meaningful.""[7] Temple of the Dog, the band's self-titled album, was released on April 16, 1991, through A&M Records and initially sold 70,000 copies in the United States.[4] Ament recalled requesting that A&M include a Pearl Jam sticker on the cover—as they had just picked their new name—because ""it'll be a good thing for us"", but they refused.[4] The album received favorable reviews,[10] but failed to chart. Critic Steve Huey of AllMusic later gave the album four-and-a-half stars out of five, stating that the ""record sounds like a bridge between Mother Love Bone's theatrical '70s-rock updates and Pearl Jam's hard-rocking seriousness.""[11] David Fricke of Rolling Stone wrote, in retrospect, that the album ""deserves immortality.""[12] The band members were pleased with the material, as it achieved its purpose; Cornell believed that ""Andy really would have liked"" the songs,[2] and Gossard also asserted that he thought Wood would be ""blown away by the whole thing"".[1] Soon after the album's release,",0,0.0
"and the unknown which is readily conceived as covered by the term _mysticism_. Mystery stories of high rank often fall under this general classification. They are neither of earth, heaven nor Hades, but may partake of either. In the hands of a master they present at times a rare, if even upon occasion, unduly thrilling--aesthetic charm. The examples which it has been possible to gather within the space of this volume are offered as the best of their type. The humorist, thank heaven, we have always with us. Spectres cannot afright him, nor mundane terrors deflect him from his path. He takes nothing either in earth or heaven seriously, as is his God-given right.

THE RIVAL GHOSTS 238 _Brander Matthews_ Masterpieces of Mystery MYSTIC-HUMOROUS STORIES MAY DAY EVE Algernon Blackwood I It was in the spring when I at last found time from the hospital work to visit my friend, the old folk-lorist, in his country isolation, and I rather chuckled to myself, because in my bag I was taking down a book that utterly refuted all his tiresome pet theories of magic and the powers of the soul. These theories were many and various, and had often troubled me. In the first place, I scorned them for professional reasons, and, in the second, because I had never been able to argue quite well enough to convince or to shake his faith, in even the smallest details, and any scientific knowledge I brought to bear only fed him with confirmatory data. To find such a book, therefore, and to know that it was safely in my bag, wrapped up in brown paper and addressed to him, was a deep and satisfactory joy, and I speculated a good deal during the journey how he would deal with the overwhelming arguments it contained against the existence of any important region outside the world of sensory perceptions. Speculative, too, I was whether his visionary habits and absorbing experiments would permit him to remember my arrival at all, and I was accordingly relieved to hear from the solitary porter that the ""professor"" had sent a ""veeckle"" to meet me, and that I was thus free to send my bag and walk the four miles to the house across the hills. It was a calm, windless evening, just after sunset, the air warm and scented, and delightfully still. The train, already sinking into distance, carried away with it the noise of crowds and cities and the last suggestions of the stressful life behind me, and from the little station on the moorland I stepped at once into the world of silent, growing things, tinkling sheep-bells, shepherds, and wild, desolate spaces. My path lay diagonally across the turfy hills. It slanted a mile or so to the summit, wandered vaguely another two miles among gorse-bushes along the crest, passed Tom Bassett's cottage by the pines, and then dropped sharply down on the other side through rather thin woods to the ancient house where the old folk-lorist lived and dreamed himself into his impossible world of theory and fantasy. I fell to thinking busily about him during the first part of the ascent, and convinced myself, as usual, that, but for his generosity to the poor, and his benign aspect, the peasantry must undoubtedly have regarded him as a wizard who speculated in souls and had dark dealings with the world of faery. The path I knew tolerably well. I had already walked it once before--a winter's day some years ago--and from the cottage onward felt sure of my way; but for the first mile or so there were so many cross cattle-tracks, and the light had become so dim that I felt it wise to inquire more particularly. And this I was fortunately able to do of a man who with astonishing suddenness rose from the grass where he had been lying behind a clump of bushes, and passed a few yards in front of me at a high pace downhill toward the darkening valley. He was in such a state of hurry that I called out loudly to him, fearing to be too late, but on hearing my voice he turned sharply, and seemed to arrive almost at once beside me. In a single instant he was standing there, quite close, looking, with a smile and a certain expression of curiosity, I thought, into my face. I remember thinking that his features, pale and wholly untanned, were rather wonderful for a countryman, and that the eyes were those of a foreigner; his great swiftness, too, gave me a distinct sensation--something almost of a start--though I knew my vision was at fault at the best of times, and of course especially so in the deceptive twilight of the open hillside. Moreover--as the way often is with such instructions--the words did not stay in my mind very clearly after he had uttered them, and the rapid, panther-like movements of the man as he quickly vanished down the hill again left me with little more than a sweeping gesture indicating the line I was to follow. No doubt his sudden rising from behind the gorse-bush, his curious swiftness, and the way he peered into my face, and even touched me on the shoulder, all combined to distract my attention somewhat from the actual words he",0,0.0

"paupires mille plis; des joues toutes sillonnes de rides qui se runissent en faisceaux aux coins des lvres et du nez, des mains sches aux doigts noueux. Vous voyez sur le col haut et pais de sa grande redingote olivtre, boutons de corne, tomber quelques mches de cheveux blancs, s'chappant de dessous le bonnet noir, tortueusement pointu, qui lui couvre les oreilles et les sourcils. Vous voyez le gilet, taill dans quelque drap terne, vas par le bas, laissant voir le pont du pantalon que l'usure a lustr, et de chaque ct duquel se montre une patte de bretelle de cuir. Vous voyez l'antique cravate de soie raille, tournant deux ou trois fois autour du cou et finissant par un petit noeud en papillon. Vous voyez la grande clef de montre en laiton estamp, pendant une ganse de filoselle verte, sous une des basques du gilet; enfin les souliers boucles d'acier quelque peu rouilles, qui dcouvrent sur le cou-de-pied un grossier bas de laine bleue. Vous surprenez, par exemple, M. Bidard se promenant dans sa classe, pas lents, les genoux flchissants, les mains derrire le dos, avanant obliquement la tte pour regarder droite, pour inspecter gauche, par-dessous ses lunettes releves, qui miroitent vaguement et semblent lui donner deux gros yeux louches de plus. Et comme vous voulez achever le tableau, complter la ressemblance, vous armez M. Bidard de quelque martinet, ou de quelque frule, que ses mains paraissent tout aises de palper, et vous donnez ses traits austres cette froide et presque cruelle svrit qui est devenue de tradition.--Mais alors je vous arrte et vous dis: Fi de la tradition! Vite, tez ce martinet; vite, enlevez cette frule, et vite rendez au respectable visage de mon vieux matre conjuguer, griffonner, la douce, la bonne, la paterne expression qui lui appartient si juste titre. Peut-tre aussi--toujours en vertu de la tradition--comptez-vous trouver dans ce pauvre instituteur de village quelqu'un de ces ridicules et pdantesques ignorants qu'un pote nous montre: Fiers d'enseigner ce qu'ils ne savent pas. Eh bien, non encore! Plt Dieu que pour ma part j'eusse pris de M. Bidard tout ce qu'il tait mme de me donner, et su apprendre aussi bien qu'il savait enseigner! Mais c'est moins de l'homme instruit que de l'homme bon que je veux vous parler; revenons l'homme bon. Oh! oui, bon! trop bon! mille fois trop bon! car la bont est-elle de mise avec une lgion d'espigles, de mutins, de musards qui semblent avoir pour unique souci de chercher le moyen par lequel chapper toute contrainte, toute discipline, toute application? L'indulgence, la douceur, la faiblesse sont-elles bien venues chez l'homme qui est confie la direction d'un essaim de garnements, dont le premier instinct est de savoir reconnatre ces bnignes dispositions pour en abuser sans mesure? Non, sans doute. Tels nous tions cependant, tous moins studieux, moins soumis, moins respectueux mme les uns que les autres, nous, les vingt ou trente lves de M. Bidard, et pourtant nous le trouvions sans cesse doux, indulgent, clment. C'tait son dfaut, ce digne homme. On le lui disait parfois; il se le disait souvent, et il devait, il voulait toujours s'en corriger; cela depuis qu'il tait matre d'cole, c'est--dire depuis prs de cinquante ans. Dieu sait s'il pouvait y avoir chance de gurison, alors que le mal avait rsist aux attaques de six ou huit implacables gnrations d'coliers. Et pourtant M. Bidard ne dsesprait pas de secouer cette maudite faiblesse, qui avait fait de son existence une longue suite de tracas, de tribulations. C'tait mme la seule certitude de savoir s'y soustraire prochainement par une nergique raction contre son caractre, qu'il avait toujours d de supporter avec une patience surhumaine son insupportable martyre. Tous les jours, tous les instants, depuis tantt un demi-sicle, le brave M. Bidard rptait part soi, et aussi comme une menace l'adresse de ses tourmenteurs: Jusqu' prsent j'ai t trop endurant, trop tolrant, mais c'est fini; je promets bien qu'on ne m'y prendra plus. Et on l'y prenait toujours, et l'effet de la promesse tait toujours renvoy aux douteuses probabilits de l'avenir. A quinze ou seize ans, M. Bidard avait embrass l'enseignement par amour pour les enfants, et, bien qu'ayant de tout temps reconnu que, dans l'intrt des enfants eux-mmes, il fallait user avec eux, sinon d'une excessive rigueur, au moins d'une judicieuse fermet, il n'avait jamais trouv en lui la force ncessaire la mise en pratique de la mthode qu'il jugeait sage. Que voulez-vous! M. Bidard tait ainsi fait, que les larmes ou mme la simple mine afflige d'un enfant le bouleversaient, le mettaient hors de lui. Le moyen avec cela de n'tre pas l'ternel souffre-douleur de ces impitoyables cratures, qui ne sont gure traitables par la mansutude qu' la condition que ce ne soit, du moins en apparence, qu'un relche de la svrit! Ce que M. Bidard ne se lassait pas de contempler avec une sorte d'extase dlicieuse, c'tait l'enfance riante, insoucieuse, tout au bonheur de l'heure prsente et la belle esprance de l'heure qui vient; mais l'enfance triste, plore, inquite, il n'en pouvait supporter la vue ni mme l'ide, et bien moins encore quand il se sentait l'auteur de sa tristesse, de ses pleurs, de son inquitude. C'est cette profonde et incurable sensibilit que M. Bidard devait tous les tourments, mais aussi toutes les joies de sa vie;--car vous pensez bien que sans quelques vives joies, faisant compensation, il n'aurait pas fourni une aussi longue carrire. Savez-vous, d'ailleurs, ce qui arrivait vingt fois pour une? Il arrivait qu'au moment o elle le voyait prt formuler sa menaante promesse,--qu'il faisait toujours prcder d'une bienveillante exhortation,--la troupe endiable paraissait aussitt s'amender en masse.

"In connection with each text, the editor has provided a critical and historical introduction, including a sketch of the life of the author and his relation to the thought of his time, critical opinions of the work in question chosen from the great body of English criticism, and, where possible, a portrait of the author. Ample explanatory notes of such passages in the text as call for special attention are supplied, but irrelevant annotation and explanations of the obvious are rigidly excluded. CHARLES E. MERRILL COMPANY Copyright, 1920 by Charles E. Merrill Co. TO THE TEACHER These stories have been chosen from authors of varied style and nationalities for use in high schools. The editor has had especially in mind students of the first year of the high school or the last year of the junior high school. The plots are of various types and appeal to the particular interests and awakening experiences of young readers. For instance, there will be found among these tales the detective story by the inimitable Conan Doyle; the true story of adventure, with an animal for the central figure, by Katherine Mayo; the fanciful story by the great stylist Hawthorne; tales of humor or pathos; of simple human love; of character; of nature; of realism; and of idealism. The settings give glimpses of the far West, the middle West, the East, of several foreign countries, of great cities, of little villages, and of the open country. Each story should be read for the first time at a single sitting so that the pupil's mind may receive the single dramatic effect in its unity of impression as the author desired, and more especially that the pupil may enjoy the story first of all as a story, not as a lesson. The pupil of this age, however, will not arrive at the other desirable points to be gained unless he then studies each story with the help of the study questions, of the related biographical sketch, and of the introductory notes, as the teacher feels they are needed for the closer study of the particular story. The stories may be studied happily in connection with the student's composition work. For example, when he has read an adventure story and his mind is stirred by it, why not assign for his next composition, a story of an adventure in which he has been interested or has figured? The mechanics of composition, moreover, are more interestingly learned in connection with an admired author's work. It is to be hoped that the students may be led to read other stories by the same and by different authors. A supplementary list of short stories has been added to the book for this purpose.

In the rush of modern life, particularly in America, the short story has come to be the most popular type of fiction. Just as the quickly seen, low-priced moving picture show is taking the place of the drama, with the average person, so the short stories that are found so plentifully in the numerous periodicals of the day are supplanting the novel. The short story may be read at a single sitting. It is a distinct type of literature; that is, it is not just a novel made short or condensed; it is in its inner plan of a wholly different nature. It relates only some single important incident or a closely related series of events, taking place usually in a short space of time, and acted out by a single chief character. It is like a cross section of life, however, from which one may judge much of the earlier as well as the later life of the character. Its History. The idea of the short story is a decidedly modern conception. It was in the first half of the last century that Edgar Allan Poe worked out the idea that the short story should create a single effect. In his story, ""The Fall of the House of Usher,"" for example, the single effect is a feeling of horror. In the first sentence of the story he begins to create this effect by words that suggest to the reader's imagination gloom and foreboding. This he consciously carries out just as an artist creates the picture of his dreams",0,0.0
"Oh, where do I even begin? My favorite songs, books, and activities? Well, I have quite a diverse range of interests, so buckle up and let's dive in!

When it comes to songs, I have a playlist that spans across different genres and eras. But if I had to pick some all-time favorites, I'd go with ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" by Queen, ""Hotel California"" by The Eagles, and ""Don't Stop Believin'"" by Journey. These songs just have this magical ability to lift my spirits no matter what mood I'm in. Music has always been a big part of my life, and these songs have become like old friends that I can rely on.

Moving on to books, I'm an avid reader, so picking just a few is tough. But there are a couple that have truly left a lasting impression on me. ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" by Harper Lee is one such book. It's such a poignant story that tackles important themes like racism and injustice. It opened my eyes to the power of empathy and the importance of standing up for what's right. Another favorite of mine is ""The Alchemist"" by Paulo Coelho. This book is all about following your dreams and listening to your heart. It's a beautiful reminder that life is a journey and that we should never lose sight of our purpose.

Now let's talk about activities that bring me joy. I absolutely love spending time outdoors, especially hiking. There's just something incredibly freeing about being surrounded by nature, breathing in the fresh air, and getting lost in the beauty of the landscape. It's my way of grounding myself and finding peace amidst the chaos of everyday life. I also enjoy painting and drawing. Art has always been a source of solace for me, allowing me to express myself and unleash my creativity.

When it comes to relationships, both friends and family hold a special place in my heart. My friends are like my chosen family, and I'm extremely fortunate to have such a supportive and loving group of people around me. We laugh, cry, and navigate through life together. They're the ones who have seen me at my best and worst, and their presence makes all the difference. As for my family, they're my rock. We may not always see eye to eye, but at the end of the day, their unwavering love and support mean the world to me. They have shaped me into the person I am today, and I'm eternally grateful for that.

Of course, life is not always sunshine and rainbows. I have my fair share of regrets and happy moments. One of my biggest regrets is not taking more risks and following my passions earlier in life. Fear of failure held me back, and I often wonder what could have been if I had embraced uncertainty and taken those leaps of faith. However, I try not to dwell on regrets too much. Instead, I focus on the happy moments, big and small, that make life worthwhile. From a simple hug from a loved one to achieving a personal goal, it's these little moments that remind me of the beauty and joy that can be found in everyday life.

So, there you have it! A glimpse into my personal preferences and experiences. Songs, books, activities, relationships, regrets, and happy moments – they all shape who I am and contribute to the tapestry of my life. And I wouldn't have it any other way.",1,0.0
"As a member of the LGBTQ+ community, I am exhausted and frustrated by the discrimination and ignorance that still persists towards homosexuality and racism. It is disheartening to witness the lack of understanding and acceptance that people have towards these issues. It is time for us to stand up and raise our voices against this injustice.

Let's start with homosexuality. It's not a disease, a choice, or a phase. It is simply a natural variation of human sexuality. Yet, there are countless individuals out there who continue to spew hate and ignorance towards the LGBTQ+ community. They use derogatory language and perpetuate harmful stereotypes that only serve to further marginalize and oppress us. It's infuriating that in this day and age, we still have to fight for our basic human rights.

What's even more disheartening is that many of these homophobic individuals rely on religion to justify their prejudice. They cherry-pick verses from holy texts, twisting them to fit their narrow-minded views. But where is the compassion? Where is the love that these religious teachings also promote? It is hypocritical to claim to follow a faith that preaches love and understanding while condemning and ostracizing a whole community of people.

I've encountered my fair share of homophobic individuals online, and let me tell you, it can be incredibly hurtful. Instead of engaging in a civil discussion, they resort to name-calling, slurs, and personal attacks. They fail to realize that behind the screens are real people with real emotions. It's as if they forget that we, too, have dreams, hopes, and the right to love who we choose.

But it's not just homophobia that plagues our society. Racism is still a deeply rooted issue as well. People of color face discrimination every day, from the workplace to the justice system. It's sickening to see how some individuals believe that the color of someone's skin determines their worth or intelligence. We are all human beings, deserving of the same rights and respect.

The ignorance surrounding racism is evident in the way racial minorities are portrayed in the media. Stereotypes continue to be perpetuated, reinforcing harmful biases and discriminatory attitudes. It's time for society to acknowledge the systemic racism that exists and work towards dismantling it. Education is key in combating ignorance and fostering a more inclusive and accepting society.

I believe in the power of education and awareness. We need to promote equality, acceptance, and understanding from an early age. It starts within our families, our schools, and our communities. We need to teach our children that love knows no gender or race, and that everyone deserves respect and equal opportunities.

To those who continue to hold discriminatory views, I implore you to open your hearts and minds. Engage in genuine conversations with people who hold different perspectives. Educate yourselves about the experiences and struggles of those who face discrimination every day. It is through empathy and understanding that we can overcome ignorance and create a better world for all.

To my fellow members of the LGBTQ+ community and people of color, please know that you are not alone. There are allies out there who stand by you, who fight alongside you. We will not be silenced. We will continue to raise our voices and demand change. Together, we can create a society where love and acceptance triumph over hate and discrimination.

In conclusion, the discrimination and ignorance towards homosexuality and racism are deeply rooted issues in our society. We must confront and challenge these prejudices head-on. It is time for love and acceptance to prevail. Let us work tirelessly towards a future where every individual, regardless of their sexual orientation or race, is treated with equality, respect, and dignity.",1,0.0
"Vittorio Vidali (27 September 1900 – 9 November 1983), also known as Vittorio Vidale, Enea Sormenti, Jacobo Hurwitz Zender, Carlos Contreras, and ""Comandante Carlos"", was an Italian communist. After being expelled from Italy with the rise of Fascist Benito Mussolini, he went to Moscow, where he became an operative for the Soviet Comintern. He was exiled to Mexico, where he was implicated in assassination attempts of Cuban communist Julio Mella and Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky. Later Vidali was active in other locations, finally leading the new communist part in the Free Territory of Trieste beginning in 1947 after World War II. He later represented the community in Parliament after it was annexed by Italy. He was born in the small coastal town of Muggia, then part of the county of Istria in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and now part of Italy. As a teenager, he joined the socialist movement in the nearby port city of Trieste. At the age of twenty, Vidali is said to have been one of the founders of the Italian Communist Party. In 1922, he was expelled from the country after Benito Mussolini ascended to power with the Fascist movement. Vidali was described as a Bolshevik in the file kept on him by the police in Fascist Italy. Vidali found refuge in the Soviet Union, relocating to Moscow. Working for the International Red Aid, Vidali was sent by the Comintern to Mexico to discipline its national party, according the Mexican Communist Party. During this period, Vidali became romantically involved with photographer and communist activist Tina Modotti, who had a previous liaison with artist Diego Rivera and was then involved with Cuban communist Julio Antonio Mella, then in Mexico. According to Tennant, Vidali's interest in Modotti was related to his killing her current lover, Mella. Mella was among the founders of the Comintern version of the Communist Party of Cuba (Tennant, 1999).[1] Mella had fled Cuba for Mexico in Gerardo Machado’s time, where he joined and then left the Mexican Communist Party. Diego Rivera portrayed Vidali, Modotti, and Mella in his mural In the Arsenal.[2] He included the figure of Tina Modotti holding a belt of ammunition on the right side of the mural. Vidali is shown staring over her shoulder and wearing a black hat. Modotti gazes lovingly at Julio Antonio Mella (shown with a light colored hat). Given Rivera's personal knowledge of these people, some[who?] analysts or critics suggest that his portrayal was evidence of Vidali's and Rivera's involvement in Mella's assassination.[clarification needed] Rivera was subsequently expelled from the Mexican Communist Party. In early December 1928, Mella was expelled from the Mexican Communist Party for his association with Trotskyists, but he was readmitted two weeks later. Mella was killed by gunshot in Mexico City on January 10, 1929, an incident believed to be a political assassination. Modotti was by Mella's side as he was shot. She was seen holding his arm, allegedly in a manner similar to her portrayal in Rivera's mural. Vidali is believed to have used the revolver he commonly carried to murder Mella. Modotti was known to keep an M1911 pistol in her house.[citation needed] Officially, José Agustín López (said to have no particular political affiliations) was charged with Mella's murder; two other known criminals, Jose Magriñat and Antonio Sanabria, were also suspects. Police investigators received conflicting eyewitness reports, which are notoriously unreliable. In one version, Mella and Modotti were walking alone, whereas another said that Vidali was walking together with the two. Mella was shot at point-blank range, and neither Modotti nor Vidali were injured. Modotti gave a false name to the investigators, and, although police were suspicious of her alibi, she was released soon after being arrested. Magriñat was also set free: he was ultimately killed in Cuba (allegedly by communists) in 1933[3] The official position of the present Cuban government is that Mella was killed on Machado's orders. It acknowledges that Modotti was known to have been a Stalinist operative in a number of countries. Some in Cuba continue to believe that Vidali killed Mella.[4] How Machado's men could have operated alone and independently in the highly politicized environment of Mexico City is not explained. According to Abers (2002), both Magriñat and Rivera (who had just returned from Cuba) would have warned Mella that he was in danger.[5] Vidali was ordered to go to Spain, where he arrived in May 1936 under the pseudonym of Carlos Contreras. He led efforts to prepare, supervise and coordinate the Antifascist Worker and Peasant Militias[6] (MAOC), organized by the Spanish Communist Party since 1934.[6] This was before the Spanish Civil War broke out. Because he had performed military training in the Soviet Frunze Academy, Vidali, and other comrades such as Enrique Líster, are credited with markedly improving the preparation of the militias.[6] As a senior advisor for the Comintern in Spain,[7] Vidali headed the 5th Regiment (Quinto Regimiento). It was responsible for the political formation of MAOC's regiments.[8][page needed] In the 1937 pro-Republican propaganda film The Spanish Earth, Vidali was shown addressing an assembly of military personnel. Vidali returned to Mexico. He was identified as involved in the May 24, 1940 attack on Leon Trotsky's residence in Mexico City, a failed assassination attempt. Iosif Grigulevich, a Soviet NKVD operative, and Mexican painter David Alfaro Siqueiros were also involved in the assault. Vidali is also thought to have been closely involved with the successful infiltration of fellow NKVD operative Ramón Mercader into Trotsky's inner circle. This resulted in Mercader's murder of Trotsky later that year. Vittorio Vidali returned to Trieste in 1947 after World War II, when the Free Territory of Trieste was established. He soon became one of the most powerful members of the Communist Party there. In 1948, after the Tito–Stalin split, Vidali became the leader of the party, and conducted a thorough purge of alleged Tito in Trieste's Communist organizations. He also worked to reduce the influence of the Yugoslavian Party on the Communist Party of the Free Territory of Trieste. He",0,0.0
"Mark Robertson Born in South London, Mark's exposure to music started at a very early age. Coming from a family of 5 and having 2 older sisters heavily into Jazz Fuision, Brit Funk and Soul, Mark soon began to acquire a taste for the jazzier side of dance music. Due to his young age, Mark's frustration with his sisters club outings in the 80's led him to sneak out on his own to some of the clubs he knew about. His unique approach to getting into one particular club took the form of paying someone in the queue to open a door at the back of a club. Initially, more times than not, he would end up standing there for hours before despondently accepting that ""it ain't gonna happen!"" However, over time, Mark's persistence paid off and some of the older queuing clubbers could be persuaded to bump open the fire exit if he crossed their palm with silver. ""I remember having to stand in the darkest corner of this club so I wasn't spotted by anyone who wanted to give me a hard time for being there. It was really awkward, I couldn't go to the loo, get a drink or basically attract any attention otherwise I would be kicked out. I was paranoid as hell but at the same time totally getting off on everyone freakin' on the dancefloor around me. I remember buying a pair of those black and white spats that the jazz dancers wore... sad but true. I didn't have a clue how to jazz dance with my 2 left feet, but I felt cool all the same."" As a teenager, Mark continued his search for all things jazzy and soulful, now taking the role of buying as many records as he could with a limited amount of money. ""I used to bunk off school and go down to Bill Shannon's shop Timewarp in Croydon. I'd ring him up and tell him how much (or little) money I had to spend and he would sort some tunes out for me. I have to say; everything that I bought from him is still good to this day. He always picked out the choice records even though I knew jack about some of this stuff. He probably won't even remember me, but I really appreciate him steering me in the right direction where he could have so easily palmed off something a little more mediocre."" ""Another poignant event for me was when I was walking past City Sounds in Holborn and heard Airto's Celebration Suite for the first time. I went mad and rushed into the shop like an idiot, lost all my decorum and just said I had to have that record. This was really the first time I had ever heard a full blown Batucada tune and it blew me away."" Now older and a bit savvier, Mark ventured out religiously to various clubs around South East England. ""In retrospect, I kick myself a bit because I think I missed out on the scene that revolved around the likes of Paul Murphy, Kev Beadle, Gilles and alike. I was going to other jazz and funk clubs in Kent, which seemed great at the time but now I've got to know more of the deejays from the other scene, I think it would have been great to have been there also. Saying that, some of the people I used to listen to on pirate radio all those years ago, I now know personally and I still get a bit of a thrill talking to them. They really helped shaped the sounds I am into now... I have great respect for them."" The beginning of Mark's deejay career started in 1992 when he moved to Sydney, Australia. ""I was at a barbecue and had some tapes on me. The guy who's barbecue it was told me to put one on. The first tune that came out of the speakers was Clarence Wheelers 'Right On'; another guy recognised the tune because it had been sampled recently. As it turned out he was one of the major club owners in Sydney and offered me a job there and then. I just happened to be in the right place at the right time."" From there, Mark held a residency at Kinselas, one of the main clubs in Sydney, with 3 floors, Mark played in the members bar for a year and a half before moving on, holding down residencies at other clubs in Sydney. ""I bumped into this guy called Paul Carroll, who is now a good friend of mine, I actually work with him here in the UK when we organise larger events in London. People were really starved of music that wasn't pop, rock or dodgy swing beat tunes that so many of the Australian deejays were spinning at that time. There were only a handful of Australians diggin' less obvious music and diggin' the crates for more interesting sounds. I found so many great records while I was there."" ""Nowadays, I think the majority of it has been uncovered, much like the States. There are now a lot of great deejays and musicians in Australia. At that time though, I had all these records and limited places to play them. Paul decided to organise his own warehouse parties. He got it so right, I remember the crowd going bonkers to James Mason's 'Free' - they hadn't heard anything like it before. I began to be Paul's main deejay over the next 3 years."" ""A great experience was when Paul flew over Roy Ayers and his entire band and we toured and deejayed around Australia. We used to attract 1500+ people to some of the most idyllic locations... it was a magical time."" Now back in London, Mark continues to explore his love affair with all things musical. As well as holding 3 residencies, he organises large 800+ music events with live international bands and deejays under the",0,0.0
"there,"" she said automatically. ""So sorry to keep you waiting. I was just taking a bath and--Oh. It's you."" Gus Doran's prawnlike eyes popped at her. ""Holy Success,"" he whispered in awe. ""You sure the wires can carry that much voltage?"" ""Well, hurry up with whatever it is,"" snapped Peri. ""I got a date tonight."" ""I'll say you do! With a Martian!"" * * * * * Peri narrowed her silver-blue gaze and looked icily at him. ""You must have heard wrong, Gus. He's the heir apparent of Indonesia, Inc., that's who, and if you called up to ask for a piece of him, you can just blank right out again. I saw him first!"" Doran's thin sharp face grinned. ""You break that date, Peri. Put it off or something. I got this Martian for you, see?"" ""So? Since when has all Mars had as much spending money as one big-time marijuana rancher? Not to mention the heir ap--"" ""Sure, sure. But how much are those boys going to spend on any girl, even a high-level type like you? Listen, I need you just for tonight, see? This Martian is strictly from gone. He is here on official business, but he is a yokel and I do mean hayseed. Like he asked me what the Christmas decorations in all the stores were! And here is the solar nexus of it, Peri, kid."" Doran leaned forward as if to climb out of the screen. ""He has got a hundred million dollars expense money, and they are not going to audit his accounts at home. One hundred million good green certificates, legal tender anywhere in the United Protectorates. And he has about as much backbone as a piece of steak alga. Kid, if I did not happen to have experience otherwise with a small nephew, I would say this will be like taking candy from a baby."" Peri's peaches-and-cream countenance began to resemble peaches and cream left overnight on Pluto. ""Badger?"" she asked. ""Sure. You and Sam Wendt handle the routine. I will take the go-between angle, so he will think of me as still his friend, because I have other plans for him too. But if we can't shake a million out of him for this one night's work, there is something akilter. And your share of a million is three hundred thirty-three--"" ""Is five hundred thousand flat,"" said Peri. ""Too bad I just got an awful headache and can't see Mr. Sastro tonight. Where you at, Gus?"" * * * * * The gravity was not as hard to take as Peter Matheny had expected. Three generations on Mars might lengthen the legs and expand the chest a trifle, but the genes had come from Earth and the organism readjusts. What set him gasping was the air. It weighed like a ton of wool and had apparently sopped up half the Atlantic Ocean. Ears trained to listen through the Martian atmosphere shuddered from the racket conducted by Earth's. The passport official seemed to bellow at him. ""Pardon me for asking this. The United Protectorates welcome all visitors to Earth and I assure you, sir, an ordinary five-year visa provokes no questions. But since you came on an official courier boat of your planet, Mr. Matheny, regulations force me to ask your business."" ""Well--recruiting."" The official patted his comfortable stomach, iridescent in neolon, and chuckled patronizingly. ""I am afraid, sir, you won't find many people who wish to leave. They wouldn't be able to see the Teamsters Hour on Mars, would they?"" ""Oh, we don't expect immigration,"" said Matheny shyly. He was a fairly young man, but small, with a dark-thatched, snub-nosed, gray-eyed head that seemed too large for his slender body. ""We learned long ago that no one is interested any more in giving up even second-class citizenship on Earth to live in the Republic. But we only wanted to hire----uh, I mean engage--an, an advisor. We're not businessmen. We know our export trade hasn't a chance among all your corporations unless we get some--a five-year contract...?"" He heard his words trailing off idiotically, and swore at himself. ""Well, good luck."" The official's tone was skeptical. He stamped the passport and handed it back. ""There, now, you are free to travel anywhere in the Protectorates. But I would advise you to leave the capital and get into the sticks--um, I mean the provinces. I am sure there must be tolerably competent sales executives in Russia or Congolese Belgium or such regions. Frankly, sir, I do not believe you can attract anyone out of Newer York."" ""Thanks,"" said Matheny, ""but, you see, I--we need--that is.... Oh, well. Thanks. Good-by."" He backed out of the office. * * * * * A dropshaft deposited him on a walkway. The crowd, a rainbow of men in pajamas and robes, women in Neo-Sino dresses and goldleaf hats, swept him against the rail. For a moment, squashed to the wire, he stared a hundred feet down at the river of automobiles. _Phobos!_ he thought wildly. _If the barrier gives, I'll be sliced in two by a dorsal fin before I hit the pavement!_ The August twilight wrapped him in heat and stickiness. He could see neither stars nor even moon through the city's blaze. The forest of multi-colored towers, cataracting half a mile skyward across more acreage than his eyes reached, was impressive and all that, but--he used to stroll out in the rock garden behind his cottage and smoke a pipe in company with Orion. On summer evenings, that is, when the temperature wasn't too far below zero. _Why did they tap me for this job?_ he asked himself in a surge of homesickness. _What the hell is the Martian Embassy here for?_ He, Peter Matheny, was no more than a peaceful professor of sociodynamics at Devil's Kettle University.

"The Polish Army in France formed in France under the command of General Władysław Sikorski (and hence sometimes known as Sikorski's Army) in late 1939, after the fall of Poland resulting from the Polish Defensive War. About 85,000 troops were in the process of being organized into fighting formations (four infantry divisions, two independent brigades and air support) when the Battle of France started. The army was partially destroyed in the hostilities, but over 20,000 soldiers were evacuated and formed a new Polish army in the United Kingdom. The creation of Polish formations in France marked the beginnings of the Polish Armed Forces in the West. The army began to be organized soon after the fall of Poland on October 6, 1939. France, a Polish ally, had formally declared war on Germany on September 3 in response to the invasion, but it had not yet undertaken any major operations against the Germans (see Phoney War) before the creation began. France welcomed the Polish refugees (as well as the Polish government in exile) and started organizing them into several military formations.[2] The main military camps for Polish formations were in Coëtquidan and Parthenay.[3] The new army was partially recruited from Polish army personnel who escaped from occupied Poland and émigrés volunteers. By May 1940, the army numbered about 80,000 personnel; about 45,000 of them were army escapees or former refugees, and the rest came from the Polish minority in France.[4] Inefficient French logistics and policies delayed the formation of Polish units by missing equipment and supplies.[2][4] Consequently, by May 1940, only two infantry divisions, two independent brigades and one air squadron were able to become fully equipped and operational, with another two infantry divisions in the process of being completely formed. The Polish high command had planned for two full corps, an armoured division, and over fifteen air squadrons.[1][2] Also, rear units were being formed, a Polish military academy and a cartographic institute.[1] The Polish command also issued a document ""Most Important Conclusions and Experiences from The September Campaign"" (""Najważniejsze wnioski i doświadczenia z kampanii wrześniowej""), in which it analysed German blitzkrieg strategy and proposed some countermeasures, but it was ignored by the French High Command.[1][5] The following units were organised in mainland France[1] Four Polish divisions: a Polish motorized brigade: and a Polish infantry brigade: In French-mandated Syria, a Polish Independent Carpathian Brigade was formed to which about 4,000 Polish troops had escaped, mostly through Romania and would later fight in the North African Campaign.[1] The Polish Air Force in France comprised only one fighter squadron GC 1/145 ""Warsaw"". Other units were to be formed, but their pilots got assigned to French squadrons or territorial defence instead.[6] Polish Navy ships which left the Baltic during Operation Peking were attached to the Royal Navy of United Kingdom, not the French command, and as such are not considered as the part of the Polish armed forces in France.[2] With the German invasion of France, at first only Polish armoured units were pressed in formation, but after the Germans broke through the French front, all Polish formations were moved to the front-line,[1] although the units still had not received all of their equipment and supplies from the French logistics services. None of the units were completely equipped by the time they entered combat and particularly the 3rd and 4th divisions were still in the middle of organization.[2] Polish units fought in the southern section of the front[7] and all continued to fight despite Philippe Pétain’s call for an armistice and demobilization on 16 June.[4] The Polish commander-in-chief, General Władysław Sikorski, on June 19, announced in a radio bulletin that Poland would continue to fight as an ally of the United Kingdom. Polish units were ordered to reach the French ports in the north, west and south in preparation for naval evacuation to Great Britain, or if that would prove impossible, to cross the Swiss frontier.[5] The First Grenadier Division (16,165 soldiers) under Bolesław Bronisław Duch was based in Lorraine, manning part of the Maginot Line from June 9 as part of the French 4th Army. It fought from 14 June. After two days, having withstood German assaults on its positions near Lagarde, it was forced to fall back, covering the retreat of the disintegrating French 52nd Division. On 21 June, with the collapse of the nearby French defences, General Duch ordered the unit to disband; many of the soldiers, including the general, were able to evacuate to United Kingdom.[2] The Second Infantry Fusiliers Division (15,830 soldiers) under Bronisław Prugar-Ketling was based between late December 1939 and May 1940 at Parthenay in Western France. Commanded by Brigadier-General Prugar-Kietling the division was charged with the defences around Belfort.[4] Engaged in heavy fighting from June 17 to 19 near Doubs and Saône rivers,[1] it stopped the German attack on the Clos-du-Doubs hills,[7] but due to the retreat of the nearby French forces it was surrounded by the Germans; nonetheless, it managed to break through to Switzerland on 20–21 June 1940, where its soldiers (including General Prugar-Ketling) were interned.[2] The 3rd and 4th Infantry Divisions were still being formed when France capitulated and took relatively little part in the hostilities.[4] The 10th Brigade of Armored Cavalry (1,079 soldiers) under General Stanisław Maczek fought in the Champagne and Bourgogne regions.[2] It protected the flank of the 4th and 6th French Armies near Champaubert, northwest of Dijon, and on June 16 routed Germans near Montbard, but by then the brigade was fighting alone, with the French units on both flanks either routed or in retreat. By 18 June the unit was mostly surrounded and without fuel and ammunition. General Maczek ordered the destruction of the unit equipment and withdrawal; the unit would be later recreated under his command in United Kingdom as the Polish elite 1st Armoured Division; Gen. Maczek would be considered one of the best Polish – and armoured – commanders of the war.[7] The Polish Independent Highland Brigade (5,000 soldiers) under General Zygmunt Bohusz-Szyszko took part",0,0.0
"The weekend came like a young lover from the suburbs, too quick and without finesse. *** LOL *** Seriously though. I had been invited by a friend of mine to attend this corporate rape of a dinner at Moishes and had eagerly accepted but with some hesitatation. Moishes--for those of you who don't live in Montreal or have never been here--is a pretty famous steakhouse where a filet mignon with nothing else on your plate costs 50 big ones and a side order of brocoli costs 10. I had never been there, but then again, I have never really been anywhere. So I said to Michelle ""Sure I'll go, hey what can I say, free Moishes."" *** So after shopping like a madman for something to wear to what I thought would be a pretty la dee da kind of dinner, and subsequently finding nothing, I went home, threw a curve hugging ""me-ow!"" kind of dress on, some strappy heels and jumped in a cab with my equally fabulous friend. We sauntered in the place (well...you can't really saunter with strappy needle-thin heels on, but you get the point) and did the whole classic stand at the entrance with your best ""I'm wayyyyyyy too cool for this "" pout-face on and scanned the bar for a friendly face. *** ""Dan! Hi!"" Michelle said, her face brightening up into a controlled smile. She walked over to this leathery slick-haired old man with her hand out like they were meeting to discuss shares or something and that this was her office. I walked obediently behind her, not knowing what role I should play for this game. I waited to be introduced. Finally, after they had said their hellos, Michelle stepped aside and said ""This is my good friend Eve."" Dan, whoever he was, took my hand, looked me in the eye and with a coy little smile asked me if I was Michelle's lesbian lover. Blink. ""She wishes."" I responded. *** 2 things : One, WHAT THE FUCK PEOPLE? First someone thinks I'm in drag, now I am a lesbian lover? Why??? WHY??????? Second, I should have known. I mean if the first thing a man says to me is hi, I think you're a lesbian, you have a pretty good idea how the rest of the night is going to go. *** Okay so back to ""yeah she wishes."" Michelle looks a little shocked, I mean this is a la dee da kind of affair, I guess I'm supposed to be demure or something? But she laughs because what else can you expect from me, seriously now. You can dress me up and take me wherever but hope I don't talk, that's all I'm saying. Dan kind of raises an eyebrow and is surprised for a moment. He smiles, says, ""well I thought you might be lovers."" To which I respond, in my element now, ""I'm too well dressed to be a dyke."" Of course I am referring to my dress and it is a joke. I am trying to be funny, change the subject, get away. He looks at my dress and says, ""Yes you look ravishing."" ""Thanks,"" I say, unsure as to whether he is making fun of me or not. I decide that he isn't, he's just being a dirty old man. The introductions are being done slowly. Each of these men has his own special way of leering. I prepare myself for quite a night. Finally Michelle and I get the chance to order some wine, we take sips from our glasses and are quiet alone for a moment. ""Am I doing okay?"" I ask from the corner of my mouth. ""Yes.""' ""Do I look okay?"" ""Yes."" ""Do I really look like a lesbian?"" ""Yes."" I love Michelle. *** Okay so we start filtering into the dining room where a long, thin table has been set up for us. We are a group of about 14 or 16, who knows. One of the dirty old men holds my waist and tells me that the seating arrangements will have to be girl / guy / girl / guy. Which is hilarious because Michelle and I are the only two women there. But anyway this particular dirty old man, we'll call him Yellow Shirt, sits between us. But a gentleman at first, holding out our chairs and seating us (which was nice. Not enough guys do that.) I am clinging to my wine. All around me are men in pastel shirts, except for one. He is sitting directly in front me me, has bushy eyebrows, thick hairy arms and is obviously the man in charge here. He has a black shirt. He is the president of the affiliate company. He looks like a pouter. I know to be nice. A pouter, by the way, is a man who absolutely needs to get his own way / get the last word / be the funniest or he will punch hole in a wall. It would be cute if it weren't so scary. Pouters are the worst losers. If a Pouter gets the wrong order in a restaurant, he's the one that won't say anything but who will kind of sigh and move food around on his plate rather than eat. He wants everyone to know how much his food sucks. If you turn down a Pouter's advances in front of his friends, he will call you a lesbian, and then go out and buy a corvette. Anyway Pouters are scary. *** I'm not sure how it happened but somehow the conversation went from me explaining what I do for a living to me explaining why I don't wear underwear. Facts about underwear: 1) They serve no purpose for me. I have nothing to pin down hold up or hold in.

""Let me have that again, please?"" ""Certainly. My name is Lawrence R. Fitzgerald. The 'R' stands for Raymond."" ""Of course, that's not the name you were born with."" The being closed his eyes and toddled around in a 360-degree rotation, remaining in place. On his world, that gesture is the equivalent of an apologetic smile. ""My Regulan name no longer matters.

The spherical creature clapped his hands in joy, three hands clapping on one side, two on the other. ""Wonderful! I will see Earth at last! I accept the terms!"" I buzzed for Ludlow and gave him the fast signal that meant we were signing this alien up at half the usual pay, and Ludlow took him into the other office to sign him up. I grinned, pleased with myself. We needed a green Regulan in our show; the last one had quit four years ago. But just because we needed him didn't mean we had to be extravagant in hiring him. A Terraphile alien who goes to the extent of rechristening himself with a Terran monicker would work for nothing, or even pay us, just so long as we let him get to Earth. My conscience won't let me really _exploit_ a being, but I don't believe in throwing money away, either. The next applicant was a beefy ursinoid from Aldebaran IX. Our outfit has all the ursinoids it needs or is likely to need in the next few decades, and so I got rid of him in a couple of minutes. He was followed by a roly-poly blue-skinned humanoid from Donovan's Planet, four feet high and five hundred pounds heavy. We already had a couple of his species in the show, but they made good crowd-pleasers, being so plump and cheerful. I passed him along to Auchinleck to sign at anything short of top rate. Next came a bedraggled Sirian spider who was more interested in a handout than a job. If there's any species we have a real over-supply of, it's those silver-colored spiders, but this seedy specimen gave it a try anyway. He got the gate in half a minute, and he didn't even get the handout he was angling for. I don't approve of begging. The flora of applicants was steady. Ghryne is in the heart of the Caledonia Cluster, where the interstellar crossroads meet. We had figured to pick up plenty of new exhibits here and we were right. * * * * * It was the isolationism of the late 29th century that turned me into the successful proprietor of Corrigan's Institute, after some years as an impoverished carnival man in the Betelgeuse system. Back in 2903, the World Congress declared Terra off-bounds for non-terrestrial beings, as an offshoot of the Terra for Terrans movement. Before then, anyone could visit Earth. After",0,0.0
"In the dystopian society of Verity City, a fierce conflict had erupted between the beleaguered pedestrians and the enraged motorists. Once united in their shared struggle against the oppressive regime, the two factions now found themselves at odds, pitted against each other in a battle for control over the limited space and resources available in their crumbling city.

On the streets, pedestrians dodged cars and taxis, weaving their way through the chaos of the city. The sidewalks, once meant for walkers, were now overrun with parked vehicles, leaving pedestrians with little choice but to step onto the treacherous roads. Frustration simmered within their ranks, as they felt their safety and well-being being disregarded by the reckless motorists.

From behind the wheels, motorists seethed with resentment. Long hours spent gridlocked in traffic and scarce parking spaces had transformed them into a volatile force, ready to explode with the slightest provocation. Pedestrians, in their minds, were an obstruction, slowing down the flow of traffic and impeding their progress. The honking of horns and the screeching of tires echoed throughout the city, creating an atmosphere of perpetual tension.

The conflict escalated swiftly, fueled by a growing sense of resentment and frustration. Pedestrians, driven to desperation, started blocking the roads, staging protests to demand better infrastructure and safety measures. Motorists retaliated by accelerating dangerously close to the protesters, hoping to intimidate them into submission. The streets became a battleground, with each side blaming the other for the chaos and danger that engulfed their city.

The government, in its attempts to mediate the conflict, imposed strict regulations on both pedestrians and motorists. Speed limits were lowered, crosswalks were redesigned, and fines were levied for any violations. But these actions only served to further stoke the fires of resentment. Pedestrians saw the regulations as mere lip service, while motorists felt that their freedom and autonomy were being curtailed.

As the conflict spiraled out of control, both sides began to prepare for confrontation. Pedestrians formed solidarity groups, organizing marches and protests to fight for their rights. Motorists, on the other hand, fortified their vehicles with metal grills and installed dash cameras to protect themselves from accusations. The city, once a symbol of resilience and survival, now stood on the brink of disintegration.

Yet, amid the chaos and animosity, there were voices of reason. Some pedestrians and motorists recognized the danger of the escalating conflict, understanding that the only way to salvage their dystopian society was through finding common ground. They believed that a compromise must be reached, despite the deep-rooted animosity between the two groups.

These voices of reason began to bridge the divide between pedestrians and motorists, organizing dialogues and negotiations. They sought to address the underlying issues that had fueled the conflict, such as the scarcity of resources and the crumbling infrastructure. Slowly, through a painstaking process of rebuilding trust, a path towards reconciliation emerged.

The government, with a newfound determination to mend the fractured society it had inadvertently contributed to, threw its weight behind these efforts. It acknowledged the grievances of both pedestrians and motorists and promised to invest in better transportation options, creating safe spaces for pedestrians and enforcing stricter regulations for motorists.

Gradually, as the wounds healed, Verity City showed flickers of its former resilience. Pedestrians and motorists, once locked in bitter animosity, now moved through the city with a newfound sense of understanding and respect. The scars of the conflict remained, a reminder of the tumultuous past, but the collective desire for a better future prevailed.

In this dystopian society, the conflict between pedestrians and motorists had been a catalyst for change, ultimately leading to a more inclusive and equitable city. Verity City had learned a valuable lesson - that even in the darkest of times, compromise and understanding could pave the way to a brighter future.",1,0.0
"On-line Friends and Guildmates I remember a brief e-mail conversation I once had with an on-line gamer who will remain anonymous. “Why do you still play the game even though you no longer enjoy it?” I asked him, and he answered, “All of my friends are there, my guildmates and my raiding buds play all the time”. This is very typical. The friendships and relationships you build within an on-line game may become quite powerful and can very well take the place of friends in your real life. In itself, and while you continue to play, there is nothing wrong with building these relationships as they become very supportive. However, when you decide to leave your on-line game, your on-line friendships and relationships may have devastating effects. Here you will learn about these effects and what is required to overcome them. On-line Friends are Not Real Friends As hurtful as this may sound, this is far often true. May gamers will emphatically insist that one's online friends are as real and as good as real life friends. While these friends within the virtual world or universe of your on-line game act, talk, support, and protect you as a real friend would, the limits of this friendship end with the game. On-line gamers often spend countless hours building their on-line friendships and relationships, filtering those individuals they do not trust or those who do not share the same ideals and goals. Gamers will spend time rallying their friends, supporting each other by creating and running quests, helping each other level, going on raids together, and helping players with all kinds of tasks like finding their epic or a specific item. Sometimes, if the friendships are strong enough, the gamer will even counseling people both in and out of game with real life issues. Although this is friendship, it is only given for as long as the gamers keep playing the on-line game. These friendships typically end when one leaves the game, or shortly after. From our personal experience and from research we preformed with the help of other recovered on-line game addicts, we found that there was never a single instance where on-line gaming friends remain good friends when one of them leaves the game. Often the friendship diminshes because the lack of constant communication and appearance within an on-line game. Typically strong on-line friendships will remain intact for approximately 1-2 months after a player leaves the game. E-Mail, message board, chat room, and instant message communication continue for a while. Soon both parties will realize that they are in two separate worlds now. One person is still an on-line gamer, spend much of his or her free time in the game and find they want to spend less and less time trying to communicate with a friend who no longer plays. The other person now realizes that they don’t want to spend time talking about the latest quest or raid because they no longer play the game and therefore find other, more valuable things in which to spend time. Most players leave a game with the intention of keeping in touch with a handful of their ""closest"" friends from the game. They believe the rapport built up between them and their friends would help their friendships last over a long period of time. They are almost always wrong. Gamers who’ve recently quit soon realize that they’ve isolated all their real life friends by playing the on-line game, and have also lost all of their on-line friends by quitting. This is one very important reason why OLG-Anon is here and why we continue to support each other through our message board. The on-line friendships will soon vanish, no matter how much time a person spends e-mailing their buddies, posting within the on-line game message boards, or even instant messaging. The gamers still within the on-line game will start to reply with less and less detail as to how they were doing, and sooner or late, the person who left will never hear from them again. Sometimes the person who left the on-line game will grow tired of hearing about the latest raid of quest and eventually stop responding on their own. What once was your best and closest on-line friends will no longer have any time for you. Very sad, but this is why recovered on-line gamers and OLG-Anon knows that on-line friendship and relationship does not carry over to the real world. Soon, a gamer who recently quit, will start to realize how empty and shallow the vast majority of on-line friendships and realtionships are. Addicted gamers will soon isolate their real life friends, just as you’ve probably done to yours. Guess what? When you’ve quit, you’re now a real life friend to them, and they will isolate you. Guilds and Guildmates, On-Line Families that Come and Go Every wonder why so many gamers decide to form guilds, make guild charters, create a website for their guilds, elect guild officers, and even arrange guild marriages? It’s because gamers want to feel like they belong to something greater than themselves. They want to belong to a cause, be closer to their friends, or just make new friends -- guildmates who have already been screened by the guild before acquiring membership. There’s nothing wrong with becoming part of a group of people, or wanting to belong. What is unhealthy is your on-line gaming addiction, and belonging to a guild is one of the worst things you can do to keep that addiction alive. Your guildmates will constantly “pull” you back into the game after you’ve logged. Through your dedication to helping your friends, preparing quests, organizing raids, and just helping newbies in the guild, you will be finding more excuses to keep playing. Why? Well, seeking an existing group of friends is very similar to seeking people to act as an extended family construct. It is the desire of every socially inclined person alive, and it is natural to have this desire.",0,0.0
"Generation X, once criticized for their perceived lack of commitment and association with grunge rock, is now emerging as a generation that defies these stereotypes. As the first Xers approach their 40s, signs of their maturing and impact on society are becoming increasingly evident. From the release of the 10th-anniversary edition of the movie ""Reality Bites"" to the rise of stay-at-home moms, Generation X is challenging the notions that were created about them in the early 1990s.

Contrary to popular belief, many Gen Xers are now business owners, parents, and individuals who reject the idea that they are cynical slackers unwilling to make commitments. Tim Nekritz, a public relations professional and graduate student in his mid-30s, states that he and his friends are getting married, having kids, settling down, and buying houses. They are approaching middle age just like previous generations, debunking the notion that they are a lost generation.

Though Generation X may not have the same numbers or name recognition as the baby boomers, their influence is being felt across various aspects of society. With approximately 60 million members aged 25 to 39, they are leaving a significant mark on parenting, career choices, and even social policy. Independent-minded and individualistic, Gen Xers are forging their own path into adulthood. They prioritize spending time with their children, even opting to leave the workforce in order to devote more time to their family. Single Xers are also striving to find a balance between work and personal life, rejecting the notion that their career should consume their entire existence.

Unlike the baby boomers, who often felt a moral duty to proclaim the right way to do things, Gen Xers are more private and less ideological. This characteristic has made them harder to understand and often led to their dismissal. However, as they assume leadership positions and become parents, a clearer picture of their generation is emerging. They are defying the apathetic label by showing an entrepreneurial spirit and a keen awareness of the need to invest for retirement. This shift in attitude towards financial security marks a significant departure from previous generations.

Generation X is the first to enter the workforce during a time of major communication technology innovations. They have wholeheartedly embraced these advances, allowing them to live life on their own terms. Technology has provided them with the flexibility to work from home outside of typical office hours, enabling them to pursue other interests and achieve a work-life balance. Heather Malec, in her early 30s, shares that she doesn't mind working remotely if it means she can have the freedom and flexibility to explore her passions.

The parenting habits of Generation X are of particular interest to those studying generational trends. Over half of children under 18 have Gen X parents, and these parents are willing to make sacrifices for the stability of their families. They are more likely to have one parent stay at home to take care of the kids and are often willing to go into debt to own a house, prioritizing their children's upbringing and striving to do a better job than the previous generation.

Gen X dads are also actively involved in their children's lives, challenging the traditional gender roles that were prevalent among the baby boomers. They share the joys and responsibilities of parenting, embracing a more hands-on approach. This shift in parenting dynamics has significant implications, influencing labor markets and housing prices. With only one parent working, couples are less concerned about living close to both workplaces. As a result, house prices are rising faster in communities that cater to single-income families.

Furthermore, Generation X is actively planning for the future, particularly retirement. They are saving for retirement at an earlier age than their predecessors and are less reliant on Social Security. This shift in attitude towards financial security marks a significant change from previous generations who often relied heavily on government assistance.

In conclusion, Generation X has matured and is making a significant impact on society. They are challenging stereotypes, prioritizing family, and taking responsibility for their financial future. As they continue to mature, their influence will undoubtedly shape various aspects of society, from parenting to social policy. The maturing of Generation X is a testament to their resilience, adaptability, and determination to create a better future for themselves and the next generations to come.",1,0.0
"It was a dark and stormy night. I know, I know, that's such a cliché opening, but honestly, that's exactly how this story started. I was driving down a deserted road, rain pouring down on my windshield, when my car decided to give up on me. Great timing, right? So there I was, stuck in the middle of nowhere, with not a single soul in sight.

After a few minutes of cursing at my car, I decided to take a walk in search of shelter. Lucky for me, there was a small cottage just a little way up the road. It was this old, quaint-looking place, with ivy crawling up the walls and a rusty, creaky gate. The perfect setting for a horror movie, if you ask me. But desperate times call for desperate measures, so I knocked on the door.

To my surprise, the door swung open without a sound. I cautiously stepped inside, my heart pounding. The room was dimly lit by a flickering candle, casting long, eerie shadows on the worn-out furniture. It was like stepping into a time machine, taking me back a few centuries.

Just as I was about to explore further, a voice startled me from behind. ""Lost, are we?"" I turned around to see a figure emerging from the darkness. He was an old man, dressed in tattered clothes, with a long, scraggly beard and a mischievous glint in his eyes.

""Well, I wouldn't say lost. More like... temporarily misplaced,"" I replied, trying to match his casual tone.

The old man chuckled. ""Well, no matter how you phrase it, you're stuck here until the weather clears up. Name's Ezekiel, by the way.""

""Dave,"" I introduced myself, extending my hand. He eyed it skeptically before shaking it, as if he hadn't seen a human in years.

Ezekiel gestured for me to sit down at the only table in the room. ""Care for a cup of tea, Dave? It's my specialty.""

I hesitated for a moment, but the rain outside was relentless, so I figured why not? ""Sure, why not. I could use some warmth.""

As we sipped our tea, Ezekiel began to tell me stories about the cottage. He claimed it had been in his family for generations, and that it held secrets untold. I must admit, I was intrigued. There was something about this place that gave me goosebumps, but in a thrilling way.

""So, what's the deal with this cottage, Ezekiel? Anything I should know?"" I asked, leaning in closer.

Ezekiel smirked, placing his cup down. ""They say that on nights like this, when the weather acts up, strange things happen here. People have reported seeing shadows, hearing voices, and even catching glimpses of long-lost loved ones. But of course, no one really believes those stories.""

I couldn't help but chuckle. ""Well, I'm not one to believe in ghosts and ghouls. But hey, who knows? Maybe this place has a way of changing people's minds.""

Ezekiel nodded knowingly. ""You may be onto something, Dave. Sometimes, the most extraordinary things happen in the most ordinary of places.""

We chatted for hours, exchanging stories and experiences. And as the night wore on, I began to feel a strange sense of comfort in Ezekiel's company. Despite the spooky tales, there was something genuine about him, something I couldn't quite put my finger on.

Eventually, the storm subsided, and I knew it was time for me to get back on the road. As I bid farewell to Ezekiel, he handed me a small leather-bound book. ""For your journey,"" he said. ""It holds the secret to unlocking the mysteries of this cottage.""

I thanked him, promising to return someday and share my own story. As I drove away, I couldn't help but feel a mixture of curiosity and excitement. The encounter with Ezekiel had stirred something inside me, ignited a thirst for the unknown.

And so, dear reader, as I sit here now, flipping through the pages of the book, I can't help but wonder what lies within the walls of that mysterious cottage. One day, when the rain falls and the lightning strikes, I will return, ready to uncover the secrets hidden in its dark corners. Until then, I'll keep my mind open and my sarcasm at the ready for the next adventure.",1,0.0
"Te Pahu is a rural community in the Waipa District and Waikato region of New Zealand's North Island, located just north of Cambridge across State Highway 1. It is located north of Pirongia and south of Ngāhinapōuri just off State Highway 39. Karamu Walkway runs along the Kapamahunga Range to the north of the village. It is part of Te Araroa long-distance walkway.[3] The first recorded settlers of the area are descendants of the Tainui waka, led by Māhanga, who established Purakau Pā at the junction of the Kaniwhaniwha stream and the Waipā River and settled the lower valley in the late sixteenth century.[4] Māhanga's son Tonganui suffered a major defeat to Kawhia Māori. The tribe suffered a major defeat to Europeans during the Invasion of the Waikato; their land was confiscated and they were forced to relocate to the north.[5] In 1879 peace negotiations Prime Minister Grey said Harapepe was excluded from the proposal to return Waikato lands to King Tāwhiao, even though former Minister of Native Affairs, Donald McLean, had included it in his offer of terms. A Waitangi Tribunal report says, ""This was, it seems, the first official public admission that not all Crown lands were to be made available to return to the Kīngitanga. In particular, the Grey Government planned to exclude the blocks that McLean had repurchased specifically to include them in the package of lands ringfenced for return, which were mostly in the Harapepe district around Pirongia. But Grey did say that some Harapepe lands would be set aside as an endowment for a school at which Kīngitanga children could be educated.""[6] The first European settler in the area was John Vittoria Cowell, a Kawhia trader,[7] who was given about 40,000 acres (16,000 ha) by Ngāti Apakura in October 1839.[8] He was the son of John Cowell, a lay missionary, who came to work with Samuel Marsden.[9] After the 1864 invasion, John Cowell lost all his lands under the Confiscation Act and died in poverty.[10] His Homewood house, on Rosborough Road,[11] to the south of Te Pahu, may date from 1841 and be the oldest surviving building in Waikato.[12] During the war the area was settled by British militia, who were banned from leaving the area but often too poor to buy crops to continue living there. Many lots were abandoned; settlers who continued living there constantly feared attack from local Māori and often sought shelter in a blockhouse. A local industry of flax milling, and mixed cow and pig farming.[5] Te Pahu remained extremely isolated for many years, with settlers relying on supplies delivered by the Waipā River. A pub and general store were established in the 1860s, followed by a post office in 1866 and a school house in 1877. The school house was used for monthly Presbyterian church services; it closed briefly and reopened before burning down in 1891; another school opened nearby in 1889 and took in the remaining students.[5] A bridge was built over the river in 1881, reducing the community's isolation.[5] The area was struck by major flooding in 1907 and February 1958, leaving the community again cut off from Te Awamutu and Hamilton.[5] A limeworks was built on Limeworks Loop Rd in 1917.[13] The name Harapepe remains on the modern map,[14] 1.2 km (0.75 mi) south of Te Pahu Road corner, though it has lost all but a few houses. It was originally the main military settlement in the area, with – The importance of Harapepe seems to have declined after Harapepe dairy was built at Te Pahu in 1897[19] and was joined in 1909[18] by neighbouring Te Pahu Post Office.[20] A daily mail service to both post offices started in 1913[21] and was taking passengers in 1914.[22] Te Pahu Hall also opened nearby in 1911.[23] The hall was renovated and extended between 1979 and 1981.[24] As late as 1935 the name Harapepe was still being used to describe a proposed extension of electric power supplies.[25] In the 1920s and 1930s Robertson,[26] then Hodgson's, Motors ran a daily bus from Pirongia to Hamilton via Te Pahu.[27] A new garage and general store was established in 1952. A limeworks opened in 1972.[5] In 2019, Waikato Regional Council reported a surge of complaints about farm effluent discharges from farms at several Waikato locations including Te Pahu.[28] Te Pahu settlement is in three SA1 statistical areas which also include Harapepe and cover 33.20 km2 (12.82 sq mi).[1] The SA1 areas are part of the larger Te Pahu statistical area. The SA1 areas had a population of 468 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 69 people (17.3%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 81 people (20.9%) since the 2006 census.

"So, let me start by saying that I love camping. There's just something about being out in nature, sitting by a crackling fire, and sleeping under the stars that rejuvenates my soul. But here's the thing: going on camping trips with a family can be a real challenge, especially when it comes to packing up the car.

My current trusty steed is a 10-year-old sedan that has seen better days. Don't get me wrong, it's been a good car, but it's starting to show its age. And as any parent knows, camping with kids means bringing along a lot of gear. Tents, sleeping bags, cooking equipment, clothes, toys... the list goes on and on. It's like a never-ending game of Tetris trying to fit everything into the limited trunk space.

Over the years, my car has become a master of disguise. I've learned to use every inch of space available, strategically placing items to maximize efficiency. The backseat has become a treasure trove of hidden compartments and secret storage. It's amazing what you can fit in there when you put your mind to it.

But let's be real here – it's exhausting. Every time we go on a camping trip, I find myself wishing for a bigger vehicle, one with a spacious trunk and maybe even a roof rack. It would make my life so much easier. No more playing car Jenga with all our camping gear. I could just toss everything in without a second thought.

But here's the catch: buying a new car is a big decision, especially when you consider all the factors involved. First and foremost, there's the cost. Cars are expensive, and a new one would definitely put a dent in our budget. Sure, there are financing options, but that means adding another monthly payment to our already tight finances.

Then there's the question of whether we really need a new car. Yes, our current car is showing its age, but it's still running fine. Sure, it might have a few dents and scratches, but nothing that affects its performance. And if I'm being honest, I don't really care about having the latest gadgets or fancy features. As long as it gets us from point A to point B, I'm happy.

The needs of our child also come into play. Right now, we only have one child, but who knows what the future holds? If we decide to have another baby, we might need a bigger car to accommodate a growing family. But for now, our current car is more than enough.

After weighing all the pros and cons, we ultimately decided to stick with our current car. Yes, it may be a bit cramped on our camping trips, but it's a small sacrifice for the sake of our finances. Besides, there's something satisfying about making do with what you have, finding creative solutions to everyday problems.

So, for now, I'll continue to play car Tetris and squeeze every inch of space out of our trusty old sedan. Who knows, maybe one day we'll upgrade to a bigger vehicle, but for now, we're going to make the most of what we have. After all, it's not about the car you drive, but the memories you make along the way. And our camping trips are filled with plenty of those.",1,1.0
"The yangban (Korean: 양반; Hanja: 兩班) were part of the traditional ruling class or gentry of dynastic Korea during the Joseon Dynasty. The yangban were mainly composed of highly educated civil servants and military officers—landed or unlanded aristocrats who individually exemplified the Korean Confucian form of a ""scholarly official"". They were largely government administrators and bureaucrats who oversaw medieval and early modern Korea's traditional agrarian bureaucracy until the end of the dynasty in 1897. In a broader sense, an office holder's family and descendants, as well as country families who claimed such descent, were socially accepted as yangban. Unlike noble titles in the European and Japanese aristocracies, which were conferred on a hereditary basis, the bureaucratic position of yangban was granted by law to yangban who meritoriously passed state-sponsored civil service exams called gwageo (과거; 科擧). This exam was modeled on the imperial examinations first started during the Goryeo dynasty of Korea. Upon passing these exams—which tested knowledge of the Confucian classics and history with poetry—several times, yangban was usually assigned to a government post. It was superficially decided that a yangban family that did not produce a government official for more than three generations could lose its status and become commoners. This superficial rule was never actually applied, but was a motivation rule for yangban to study harder. In theory, a member of any social class except indentured servants, baekjeongs (Korean untouchables), and children of concubines could take the government exams and become a yangban. In reality, only the upper classes—i.e., the children of yangban—possessed the financial resources and the wherewithal to pass the exams, for which years of studying were required. These barriers and financial constraints effectively excluded most non-yangban families and the lower classes from competing for yangban status, just like scholar-officials in China.[1] Yangban status on a provincial level was de facto hereditary. It was customary to include all descendants of the office holders in the hyangan (향안; 鄕案), a document that listed the names and lineages of local yangban families. The hyangan was maintained on blood basis, and one could be cut off from it if members of the family married social inferiors, such as tradesmen. Although the hyangan was not legally supported by government acts or statutes, the families listed in it were socially respected as yangban. Their householders had the customary right to participate in the hyangso (향소; 鄕所), a local council from which they could exercise influence on local politics and administration.[2] By reserving and demanding socio-political power through local instruments such as hyangan and hyangso, yangban automatically passed down their status to posterity in local magnate families, with or without holding central offices. These provincial families of gentility were often termed jaejisajok (재지사족; 在地士族), which means ""the country families"". Thus, while legally, yangban meant high-ranking officials, in reality it included almost all descendants of the former and increasingly lost its legal exactitude. Throughout Joseon history, the monarchy and the yangban existed on the slave labor of the lower classes, particularly the sangmin, whose bondage to the land as indentured servants enabled the upper classes to enjoy a perpetual life of leisure—i.e., the life of ""scholarly"" gentlemen.[1] These practices effectively ended in 1894 during the Korean Empire of Gwangmu Reform. In today's Korea, the yangban legacy of patronage based on common educational experiences, teachers, family backgrounds, and hometowns continues in some forms, officially and unofficially. In South Korea, the practice exists among the upper class and power elite, where patronage among the conglomerates tends to predictably follow blood, school, and hometown ties. In North Korea, a de facto yangban class exists that is based mostly on military and party alliances. Yangban literally means ""two branches"" of administration: munban (문반; 文班) which comprises civil administrators and muban (무반; 武班) which comprises martial office holders. The term yangban first appeared sometime during late Goryeo but gained wider usage during the Joseon Dynasty.[3] However, from the sixteenth century onward yangban increasingly came to denote local wealthy families who were mostly believed to be the descendants of once high-ranking officials. As more of the population aspired to become yangban and gradually succeeded in doing so in the late Joseon period by purchasing the yangban status, the privileges and splendor the term had inspired slowly vanished. It even gained a diminutive connotation. Yangban were the Joseon Dynasty equivalent of the former Goryeo nobles who had been educated in Buddhist and Confucian studies. With the succession of the Yi generals in the Joseon dynasty, prior feuds and factions were quelled through a decisive attempt to instill administrative organization throughout Korea and create a new class of agrarian bureaucrats. The individual yangban included members of this new class of bureaucrats and former Goryeo nobility. While ostensibly open to all, the ""civil service exams"" (과거) catered to the lifestyle and habits of the yangban, which created a semi-hereditary meritocracy, as yangban families overwhelmingly possessed the minimum education, uninterrupted study time and immense financial resources to pass such exams. The yangban, like the Mandarins before them, dominated the Royal Court and military of pre-Modern Korea and often were exempt from laws including those relating to taxes.[1] There were at most 100 positions open with thousands of candidates taking the exams. Competition that was originally supposed to bring out the best in each candidate gave way to the importance of familial relationships. Because the Joseon Court was constantly divided among the Northern, Southern, Eastern, and Western faction members (the eccentric geographical naming derived from the location of each leader's house in Seoul which were divided into subsections), a divided system resulted where corruption was very difficult. With each faction constantly probing for an excuse to kill off the other, if one faction was proven to be corrupt then the other factions would immediately jump on the chance to purge them. The attempt to receive or give bribes on a massive scale was suicide. It wasn't until the reign of King Sunjo that the Kim clan of Andong in cooperation with few other",0,0.0
"Bredhurst is a village and civil parish in Kent, that forms part of the Borough of Maidstone in England. Its population was 330 (1990), increasing to 397 at the 2011 Census.[1] There has been a settlement on the site of the present day Bredhurst since neolithic times because of fertile fields and the good wood supply. The village is quite close to the M2 motorway but retains a traditional feel. Bredhurst is centred on The Bell Inn and Bredhurst Church of England primary school. The first dates from the Tudor period, the latter was founded in 1866. The school averages just over 125 pupils with about sixteen pupils per year. Every year on or about the first Saturday of May, Bredhurst School holds its annual mayday celebration. This event is marked by maypole dancing, the crowning of the May Queen, the pageant of Saint George and the dragon, a procession, and many stalls. The procession starts at Abbots Court farm and ends at Bredhurst School, down the street. The traffic is stopped and the whole village is decked in bunting and banners. Bredhurst manor dates from the time of King Edward III. It was bought by John of Gaunt in 1379 before King Richard II gave it to Simon de Burley in 1384. Burley lost the manor when he was accused of high treason in 1390. By 1551, Sir Thomas Cheney was owner of the manor, followed by the Kemsley family later in the 16th century. Isabel Kemsley stipulated that her son John should hold 'a drinking' in the village on All Saints' Day and this tradition continued until the 19th century, when it was replaced with the more popular mayday celebrations. The 19th century owners of the manor were the Romilly family, terminating when it was sold by the widow of the fourth Baron Romilly, William Guy Gospard Romilly (who died in 1983). It was later bought by a family who do not have a title, who sold most of the grounds off. St Peter's church at Bredhurst is situated in woodland separate to the village. Typical of downland flint churches, it combines its 13th-century origins with 19th-century additions including a small bellcote with two bells. There is a small graveyard. Inside the church are a number of memorials to people who died in the first and second world wars. During the 16th century Reformation the treasures of the church were hidden by the incumbent and his parishioners and have never been found. The treasure included a golden chalice and the golden altar plate. The famous Bredhurst paten, which held the communion bread, was found and restored in 1907. It is made of copper and was originally gilded, and dates from 1180–1260. It is one of only four known and all the others were found in the graves of bishops or archbishops. The paten is said to be priceless and is kept at the Victoria & Albert Museum as part of their ""sacred silver"" collection. Bredhurst was largely untouched during the Blitz and the whole Second World War, however in 1939 evacuation began; the evacuees went to Bredhurst School. Today most of Bredhurst is still made up of farms and woodland; these include Abbots Court farm, Aaron Bank farm and Grange farm. It was reported that there are more livestock living in Bredhurst than people. Bredhurst School was built in 1867 during the later part of the Victorian era. In the log book of Bredhurst school the rural dean was reported to say ""I am glad to find that a very good school has been built which is of great advantage to the Parish and of material benefit to the rising generation.” The school was typically Victorian with high windows in the schoolroom to avoid distractions to pupils, a central stove to provide heating and the Schoolmistress' accommodation adjoining. The earliest log book shows that Mrs S.Belcher was Headmistress and was supported by two assistant mistresses and the Vicar who lived in the Rectory, an imposing edifice which stood where Fir Tree Grove is now situated. The curriculum differed greatly from today's and included drill for the boys, knitting and needlework for the girls, recitations and object lessons on subjects as diverse “The Tongue of a Bee” and “Dairying and Cattle Feeding.” These object lessons were sometimes given by the Managers of the School or the Vicar and were illustrated by lantern slides. Bredhurst has always been a Church school and as such the regular three-hour Scripture lessons were very important. The Vicar attends very frequently to teach the children Bible stories, Catechisms and Psalms. Many of the issues faced by the Victorian school remain the same today; financial restraints, heating, maintenance, behavioural problems, visits from the School (nit) Nurse, dentist etc., etc. In those days, however, there were more holidays in which to recover the equilibrium. There were holidays to accommodate hop picking, fruit picking, harvesting, Ascension Day, Whitsun, Empire Day, Independence Day, school treats/picnics, Sunday school outings, choir outings, Bank holidays, all ‘Royal' events and even ‘whim' holidays granted at the Managers discretion! All these in addition to the regular Christmas, Easter and summer holidays! Today however there are holidays for christmas, summer and easter as well as may day and half term breaks. Over the years the school has had a varied career, apart from being an educational establishment it has also served as a billet for soldiers during World War I, polling station, parish meeting place and evening school. A special meeting of the parish took place in June 1903 to appoint Mr H Chapman as Manager for the School for a period of three years. The school also housed a museum with various exhibits originating from the Victorian era which were used extensively during object lessons. The police were in attendance regularly on Saturdays from 1913 in order to issue pig licences. Parishioners gathered in the schoolroom in 1919 in order to organise a 'Peace Celebration' for the village in the form of a",0,0.0
"forward to it a long time but it had not worked out as planned. It had not worked out as planned because Slade, only hours from the execution chamber with absolutely nothing to lose, had splattered the guard's brains around the inside of his cell and marched outside with a frightened Marcia Lawrence. Outside. Outside the cell block while other condemned prisoners roared and shouted and banged tin cups on bars and metal walls and judas-hole-grills. Outside the prison compound and across the dome-enclosed city which served the prison. Then outside the dome. [Illustration] Outside the dome there was rock. Rock only, twisted and convoluted and thrusting and gigantic like monoliths of a race of giants. Rock alone under the awesome gray sky. Steaming rock, for some of the terrestrial waters were still trapped at great depths. And the sea far off, booming against rocky headlands, hissing tidally and slowly, in an age-long process, pulverizing the rock. The sea far off, a clean sea, not sea-smelling sea, a sea whose waters must evaporate countless times and be borne up over the naked rocks in vapor and clouds and come down in pelting, endless rain and rush across the rock, frothing and steaming--a sea which must do this countless times in the eons to come, and would do it, to bring salinity to its own waters. ""It kind of scares the hell out of you, doesn't it?"" Adam Slade said. He was a big man with a thick neck and heavy, sleepy-looking eyes and a blue beard-shadow on his stubborn jaw. He said those words as he climbed out of the prison tank with Marcia Lawrence. The tank's metal was still warm from over-heated travel. ""I didn't think anything would scare you,"" Marcia Lawrence said. She had conquered her initial terror in the five hours of clanking tank flight from the prison. They had come a great many miles from the prison dome, paralleling the edge of the saltless sea and then finally, when their fuel was almost gone, clanking and rattling down toward the sea. She was a newspaperwoman, that above all now. She must not be afraid. She had a story here. A story. ""Get moving,"" Adam Slade said. ""I got nothing against you, lady,"" he told her for the tenth time. ""But you try anything, you're dead. You get that? I got nothing to lose. One time is all they can kill me. But first they got to find me, but they won't be able to take me as long as you're here. Just stay meek and you'll stay alive."" ""How long do you think you can hold out?"" Marcia Lawrence asked practically. They had begun to walk away from the now useless tank. Adam Slade was carrying the dead guard's M-gun in the crook of his bent left arm and walking with long, easy, ground-consuming strides. Marcia almost had to run to keep up with him as they went down a stretch of slightly sloping black rock toward the steaming, hissing, pounding, roaring, exploding surf. Slade smiled. ""Plenty of water,"" he said. ""But no food, Mr. Slade. There is absolutely no food on earth now and no possible way of getting food unless you want to stick around for a few million years."" ""You think I came out here without a plan?"" Slade asked with some hostility. ""I don't know. You were desperate."" ""As long as you're with me I figure they might follow, but they won't rush me. They might even send over a 'copter, but it won't try anything. Not with you here. Desperate? I'm not desperate, and don't you forget it. Desperate you don't think straight. Once is all they can execute me. I stayed behind, they'd of done it. If they catch me, they'll do it. What's the difference?"" ""You said you had a plan."" * * * * * They reached the edge of a thrusting headland, an enormous beak-shaped cliff of beetling black rock which leaned out over the young, still saltless ocean. Slade paced back and forth quickly, with a powerful leonine grace, until he found a fault in the rock. The fault tumbled jaggedly, steeply down almost to the edge of the sea. ""Down there,"" Slade said. ""We'll follow the sea coast back to the prison."" ""Back?"" Marcia said in disbelief. ""Hell yes, back. You said it yourself. There's no food out here. Since there ain't no life, of course there's no food. Oh, it's a great place for a prison, all right. Whoever thought of it ought to win a prize. A prison--a billion years in the past. What's the word?"" ""Archaeozoic,"" she supplied. ""Yeah, archaeozoic. An archaeozoic prison. You can escape to your heart's content, but what the hell's the difference. There's no life back here, not yet. The Earth's just a baby. So you escape--and you starve to death. It makes every maximum security jail before this one look like a kid's piggy bank."" ""There hasn't ever been an escape,"" Marcia said hopefully as they made their way down to the sea, she in front and Slade behind her with the M-gun. ""There ain't never been a hostage before."" ""No-o."" ""There's a hostage now."" Marcia Lawrence took a deep breath and asked suddenly, ""Are you going to kill me?"" ""Hell, I don't know. I got no reason to--unless you make me. We're going back there. We're double-tracking along the beach, get me? Back to the prison dome."" ""But--"" ""Adam Slade won't starve to death out here. We'll double back to the dome--and the time machine."" ""Oh,"" she said. They began to walk along the edge of the sea, its waters sullen gray, mirroring the sky. Here on this dawn earth the sky has as yet never been blue, for the primordial waters were still falling, falling. It rained almost all the time and the air was thick with moisture and every night when the sun--as yet unseen by the dawn earth except as an invisible source",0,0.0
"The 2014-15 season for the Mount St. Mary's Mountaineers men's basketball team was filled with excitement, challenges, and notable moments. Led by head coach Jamion Christian, the team faced tough opponents, showcased their skills, and left a lasting impression on the college basketball community.

The Mountaineers entered the season with a roster filled with talented and determined players. Among the key contributors were senior guard Julian Norfleet, junior forward Gregory Graves, and sophomore guard Byron Ashe. Norfleet, who had been a consistent force for the team in previous seasons, provided veteran leadership and was known for his scoring ability and on-court decision-making. Graves, a versatile forward, was instrumental in both scoring and rebounding, while Ashe's quickness and defensive skills made him a valuable asset to the team.

The season started with a series of non-conference games, where the Mountaineers faced off against tough opponents to prepare for their conference schedule. Although they had some early setbacks, the team showed resilience and determination, pushing themselves to improve with each game.

As the Northeast Conference (NEC) conference play began, the Mountaineers faced stiff competition from fellow conference teams. A standout game occurred on February 12, 2015, when they faced the St. Francis Brooklyn Terriers in a thrilling matchup. The game went into overtime, with both teams giving their all. The Mountaineers displayed great offensive efficiency, shooting nearly 50% from the field and going 11 for 16 from three-point range. Sophomore guard Byron Ashe had a career-high 25 points, leading his team to a hard-fought victory.

Another notable game came on February 23, 2015, when the Mountaineers went head-to-head against the Robert Morris Colonials. This game was crucial as both teams were vying for a top spot in the conference standings. Despite a tough battle, the Mountaineers emerged victorious with a final score of 72-71. Junior forward Gregory Graves had a stellar performance, scoring 21 points and grabbing 8 rebounds. The win gave the Mountaineers a boost of confidence and helped solidify their position in the conference.

Throughout the season, the Mountaineers showcased their playing style known as ""Mount Mayhem."" This aggressive, up-tempo style of play was built on solid defense and fast-paced offensive transitions. The team looked to generate turnovers and capitalize on their opponents' mistakes, often leading to quick baskets in transition. This style of play not only entertained the fans but also challenged their opponents, making the Mountaineers a formidable force on the court.

As the regular season came to a close, the Mountaineers had secured a spot in the NEC Tournament. They entered the tournament with high hopes and determination to win the conference championship. Their journey in the tournament began with a matchup against the Sacred Heart Pioneers. In a hard-fought battle, the Mountaineers came out on top, winning by a score of 60-52. Senior guard Julian Norfleet led the team with 20 points, showcasing his leadership and experience in high-pressure situations.

However, their tournament run ended in the semifinals when they faced the eventual champions, the Robert Morris Colonials. Despite a valiant effort, the Mountaineers fell short, losing 60-48. While it was disappointing not to reach the championship game, the team's performance throughout the season and in the tournament earned them respect and recognition.

The 2014-15 season for the Mount St. Mary's Mountaineers men's basketball team was a rollercoaster ride of emotions, filled with memorable moments, standout performances, and a strong commitment to their unique playing style. The team's determination and perseverance were evident in their ability to compete against tough opponents and secure a spot in the NEC Tournament. Though their season ended earlier than they had hoped, they left a lasting impression on fans and opponents alike, setting the stage for future success.",1,0.0
"On 27 March 1968, Suharto was declared the President of Indonesia. Events leading to the inaugaration of Indonesia’s second president started with the notorious yet controversial 30th September Movement in 1965. Suharto’s grip of power was shrouded in controversy, debating as to whether the coup overthrowing the president was inspired by communism, or the army pre-empting the coup. The coup might also have been a setup by the army, supposedly in the name of protecting the president, to eradicate the communists before overthrowing the president. Despite the controversies, Major-General Suharto, a senior army officer in his forties, was quick to seize the opportunity in establishing support from the coup. Not surprisingly, he earned kudos for his presidential bid. Sukarno won independence for Indonesia from the Dutch and fashioned Indonesia through his notion of a Guided Democracy – a balanced power relationship between the President, the army and the PKI (Indonesian Communist Party). The 30th September coup, however, crippled this triangle and accelerated the fall of Sukarno. Before the 1965 coup, factual accounts proved that the Indonesia under Sukarno, a president whose health was ailing, had also been crippled by economic woes and sour international relations. Such mismanagement of the country saw Sukarno’s popularity plummet and hastened his fall from the presidency. Sukarno’s leftist-slant towards communism led Indonesia’s foreign policy into making bold but preposterous moves by forcing the merger of Netherlands New Guinea into Indonesia and declaring war on Malaysia. By August 1965 Sukarno had withdrew Indonesia from the International Monetary Fund, Interpol and the World Bank, thereby isolating Indonesia from the capitalist market. Indonesia’s social, political and economic structures were in chaos. Inflation soared to 900 per cent, export trade collapsed, and shortages of food sparked riots and signalled an imminent coup. Indonesia was in economic disarray and politically tumultuous. The PKI, whose members totalled more than three million, provided the mass support for Sukarno’s external militant campaigns, while Sukarno offered protection for the PKI against persecution by the army. Sukarno was balancing on a very fragile power triangle that was his Guided Democracy. It is likely that Sukarno’s increasing reliance on the PKI in the mid-60s made the army feel its position was threatened and this exposed the soft underbelly of the Guided Democracy. It prompted Colonel Untung to execute the 30th September movement from Halim airbase. This Movement, from which Suharto was to benefit the most, left six army generals dead, including Army Chief of Staff General Achmad Yani. General Nasution managed to escape and Suharto was left off the list due to his neutralist stance. The death of six prominent army generals left Suharto, commander of the Army Strategic Reserve (Kostrad), a heavy responsibility but along with a fortuitous luck since there were no other generals who could match his appointment. Lieutenant Colonel Untung announced on the radio that the coup was planned by a ‘Council of Generals’ who sought to overthrow the president and the Movement was to pre-empt a coup by the army on President Sukarno. Untung assured that Sukarno was under the protection of the Movement but he did not mention that he acted in accordance to Sukarno’s orders. Suspicions logically arise that Suharto was one of the plotters. Colonel Latief, one of the key plotters of the coup, was rumoured to have visited Suharto twice shortly before 30th September and warned Suharto about the plot, hence suggesting that Suharto was able to make ample preparation to topple and subdue the coup. When Latief was brought to trial in 1976, he admitted that he had told Suharto about the imminent coup two days earlier. With the death of Yani and the absence of Nasution, Suharto gained recognition from the people and grabbed the opportunity to seize command of the army. Suharto proclaimed over the radio that he had taken control of the army and would make sure he crushed the 30th September Movement to ensure the safety of the President. Suharto immediately took measures to counter the coup by talking the two rebel battalions over to his side. He contacted other key army officers and secured their support for acting against Halim, where the 30th September Movement took place. On the morning of 2nd October 1965, Suharto moved his forces and took control over Halim airbase. Simultaneously, Suharto took control over the national radio station and closed down most of Indonesia’s newspapers, manipulating the event to his will. The PKI was accused of masterminding the coup due to the killing and mutilation of the generals at Halim. An autopsy carried out several years later revealed that such mutilation never took place. Sukarno was, at this stage, still reluctant to ban PKI activities and its organisation. Suharto swiftly made his counterattack once more by inciting the military to allow the massacre of the PKI by the Muslims across Java, Bali and Sumatra, thus smashing Sukarno’s triangular relationship with the army and the PKI. The number of deaths was estimated at between 100,000 to more than one million, although a figure of between 300,000 and 500,000 is more likely. Furthermore the massacre of communists and left-wing sympathisers was supported by the US embassy, which provided logistical support to the army. Suharto’s name became known to the US through this bloodbath and with the US throwing her weight behind Suharto, his presidential bid was strengthened. Suharto, in a bid to undermine the remaining pro-Sukarno military and civilian forces, disseminated details of Sukarno’s political, economic and moral transgression. Sukarno was subsequently coerced into signing the ‘March 11 Order’, which bestowed extensive political and military powers on Suharto in the name of preserving law and order and ‘protecting the president’. Thus, the 1966 ‘March 11 Order’ shifted the domestic balance of power in favour of Suharto and reduced Sukarno’s rights to leadership. In January 1966, with support from the student demonstrations, Suharto further flexed his political muscles. After the ‘March 11 Order’, Suharto implemented a series of reforms for Indonesia. First, he set up a new cabinet excluding",0,0.0
"As I've revealed in an earlier blog, my older sister, Stephanie, is handicapped. Today she is a happy, routinized 36 year-old woman with the overall intellect of a 4 year-old. I'm sure Mom would argue with me because, yes, there are some areas where Stef is functionally older than 4, but other areas where she is less than 4. She cannot, however, be left alone to take care of herself. Well, you could, but she would make the decisions any good 4 year-old would-- ""Now, where are those cookies?"" If left to herself during mealtime she may be found eating spoonfuls of ketchup or sugar, yuck. If left to herself she could not dial the phone, or put out a small fire, or write a letter. A few years ago my nephew, Tyler, Stef, and I were riding in the back of a truck. He stared at Stef for the longest time. I could see his brain trying to decide what to say. I braced myself, because no matter how much I like a person, the minute they make fun of the handicapped they find themselves on my imaginary hit list for years to come. He quietly said to me, ""Mom says that she's a grown-up on the outside, but inside she's always a little girl."" It makes me cry even now to remember it. What a perfect description. And the enormous respect it gave me for my sister-in-law at that moment can never be explained. To be that thoughtful and careful as a mom, knowing that your son would need a way to understand what he was about to see... Suzy, you're one of my all-time favorites! I can remember being a teenager, and Mom coming home from an annual evaluation meeting where all of the disciplines who cared for Stef got together and went over ""how she was doing"". (Mom ALWAYS hated those meeting.) This one was harder than others had been because they were trying to convince Mom that Stef was ""low trainable"", only a few IQ notches above being considered ""severely handicapped."" Mom wouldn't buy it. ""She's more than that,"" she insisted. My mom has always been Stef's greatest champion, believing more than was ever predicted for her child's future. Stef was born 6 weeks early (but weighed over 6 pounds!!!) at a hospital in Detroit, Michigan. She was blind at birth, a diagnosis that wasn't caught until months later, but at nine months miraculously began to see... sort of. She's had Coke-bottle lenses since her nine month birthday. Her corrective prescription was so strong that I can remember my little sister and me putting on her glasses and running around as a game. It made things look warped and uneven, like everything was a mirror in a carnival fun house. Poor kid. Mom made monthly trips to the doctors, who never were able to give her a real diagnosis, just bits and pieces. ""Cervical nerve damage, "" ""cerebral palsy,"" ""reverse swallow mechanism,"" and my personal favorite, ""other mental and physical handicaps."" ""She will never walk, talk, or be able to remember sequences."" Upon discharge for the hospital following her birth - and this is the honest truth - my father was approached by a doctor who told him he had some papers for my Mom and Dad to sign. The doctor said, ""You can just go home and forget you ever had this baby."" I believe the papers were to either 1) make Stef a ward of the state and institutionalize her for her entire life, or 2) euthanize her. My dad told him what he could do with his papers, and he took his wife and daughter home. Gosh, I could fill a book about growing up as the younger sister of a handicapped child. Someone once asked me, ""How did growing up with Stef effect your life?"" My response was, ""It impacted everything, the way in which I see and process the whole world."" It has made me less trusting, because I have seen children and adults taunt Stef when they thought no one was looking. It has given me an overdeveloped sense of justice - I just love it when the bad guy gets it in the end; perhaps because SO MANY S.O.B.'s who ridiculed my sister seemingly got away with it (for that moment). It has made me the eternal advocate. I am constantly trying to speak for the ""victim"" or the voiceless. It has made me angry at the Church in general, something which no self-respecting pastor's wife should admit. In my hometown churches I regularly saw people, some considered ""saints,"" who dealt cruelly and impatiently with ""the least of these,"" not just Stef, but other handicapped children in the congregation. My sister loves church, especially the music. I don't know how, but this child, who was never supposed to remember things in sequence, has somehow memorized the hymnal! We lovingly call her ""Johnny One Note"" because though she knows them, the songs are more or less moaned out loud, but if you listen you can barely make out the correct vowel sounds corresponding with the actual words. One time, one of the saved-and-sanctified club cornered my sister in the foyer and shook her finger in Stef's face and demanded her to be quiet during the singing of the hymns, ""You don't sing pretty!"" she hissed. My mom, the amazingly poised woman that she is, witnessed the incident with a broken heart, and publicly wept when she saw Stef with her finger silently pressed to her lips, the ""quiet"" sign, during that evening service. Stef didn't sing out loud for months after that. Oh, the stories I could tell you-- As you can see, I'm the one who grew up handicapped. Yet the God who allowed Stef to be placed in my life, who saw the roots of bitterness wind their way down into my young heart, is also the same God who faces me today and says, ""Out with",0,0.0
"It was the most amazing Thursday Poovathurkaddavil Baby Philips’ had experienced in his forty years of life, at his hilly home town in north-east Kerala. The fact that the RSS – UDF clash in the nearby town of Kannur had left 40 dead did nothing to diminish the bliss. He had just become a proud father and though his ever dutiful wife had borne him 3 other children, this one was certainly different – it was a girl this time. Finding a name for the child took lesser time than lighting a candle at the chapel. With the first three children being named Vincent, Vinton and Vindy, it was a foregone conclusion that the next one would be named Vinny. Though the preferred sex of the arriving one was definitely girl, having a name like Vinny would have helped anyways, even if God had decided to postpone a girl till the next time. The fact that children found their names not the least bit preposterous was more due to the fact that their mates at school had more ridiculous names. In school there already were three siblings Biju, Miju and Siju. There was even a pair of opposite-sex twins who were named Lijo and Liji just because their parents were Lily and Joseph. The Baby family was certainly quite known around the town. With Mr. Baby philip being a government servant employed in the office of the District Agricultural Officer, he hardly had to step out of his house. The number of Bandhs, Hartals and Leaves always summed upto over 300 days. His occasional visit to office was more to bring home the farming goods that were unnecarrily stocked at his office. Hence he had the time and resource to turn the few acres of his inherited family estate into a haven of pepper and coffee. His brother had his own business going in the Gulf (it was widely believed that he had the largest chain of Tea Shops in Jeddah alone) and had managed to smuggle in quite a few Akai products. Like all rich men Baby Philip was quite well known and this made life for the family quite comfortable. Vinny Baby grew as the darling of the house. Most of the days were spent playing Hopscotch with friends. Watching her brothers climb coconut trees and designing colorful Lungis for her dad were among the favorite past times. She loved school but hardly manage to attend any. Schools never opened during monsoons for fear of the thatched roof collapsing and then there were always enough reasons for teachers to close shop on those rare occassions when it did not rain. However Vinny did spend a sizeable part of her childhood in Sunday Schools. The family being orthodox syrian catholics; church formed a major part of her Sunday life and the rest of the day was spent feasting over various marine and land animals deep fried in coconut oil and garnished with grated coconut. Venkatapuru Appa Reddy also was born on a Thursday but in the sunny plateaus of Krishna district. His parents welcomed their bundle of joy by offering eleven full grown sheep to their family deity, even as the kid’s maternal uncles had just chopped off the hands of four of their rival caste men. It had certainly taken quite a while for them to have their first kid and knowing that he could be the only one, they decided quite instantly to shower all they had on this little one. The little one however grew quite fast and before they knew was already turning out to be a plumpy pampered pest. Naming the child had certainly taken some deliberation, not just among the different members of the maternal and paternal family but also among their favorite astrologers. A good two years went this way and the name Appa was finally decided probably due to the fact that this was the first word the kid had blurted out. Appa grew up on continuous learning of naxal killings and feudal war fares. This was supplemented with loads of parental love (in the form of the finest ghee and butter) being part of his daily quota of truckloads of rice, sambar and the hottest of mango pickles. He also was a very fast learner. By the age of nine he could recite all of Chiranjeevi’s dialogues by heart. He also knew the complete vital statistics of every single heroine in the Telegu film industry. He very soon learnt to single handedly take care of the family’s large Ganja farm. Climbing down the house’ well (in the walls of which all the cash was stashed away) and brewing home made hooch was among his favorite hobbies. By the age of 13 he also knew that his rich cousin’s new born girl was to be his future wife. Though studies was the last thing in his mind Appa was very smart and had soon realized that his movie heroes got to use automatic self loading weapons to kill their city based villains but had to make do with sickles and knives in the villages. Soon he set his sight on moving out of his tiny hamlet to Hyderabad not just to have a better living but to experience the pleasure of killing people with guns as he had been sick of chopping people with swords. Vinny Baby grew to become a fine young lady. The gallons of Coconut oil that went into her hair everyday gave her long tresses that accentuated her looks. Her brothers on the other hand also had done decently well for themselves. One held the state record for the fastest coconut tree climbing championship. The other was doing a thesis on making country bombs at home. And the third was already renowned as the fastest growing tea shop magnate in Sharjah.

It was then that Hassan noticed a figure making their way towards him, their confident stride catching his attention. The stranger had an air of self-assurance about them, a stark contrast to the usual timid customers he encountered. Intrigued, Hassan adjusted his garments and prepared himself for this unique encounter.

As the mysterious customer reached his booth, their eyes locked with Hassan's, a spark of curiosity flickering in them. Without hesitation, the customer made their way towards a particular item on display - a beautifully crafted vase, adorned with intricate patterns and exotic symbols.

""I've never seen anything quite like this,"" the customer remarked, their voice confident and steady.

Hassan smiled, pleased that his collection had enticed this intriguing individual. ""Ah, the vase is a rare find indeed,"" he replied, his voice laced with pride. ""It was brought all the way from the eastern lands, crafted by the most skilled artisans. Its origins are shrouded in mystery and beauty.""

The customer's eyes widened with fascination. ""Eastern lands, you say? I've always dreamt of visiting those distant shores,"" they mused, a hint of longing in their voice.

Hassan's curiosity deepened. This customer was unlike any other he had encountered. There was a sense of adventure and knowledge about them, a spirit that resonated with his own dreams of exploration. ""A voyage to the eastern lands is quite the endeavor,"" he admitted, his voice tinged with a touch of excitement. ""There are countless wonders to be discovered, the likes of which words cannot capture.""

The customer leaned closer, their voice lowering to a conspiratorial whisper. ""Tell me more, good merchant. What tales do the winds carry from those distant waters? Are there treasures to be found?""

Hassan's eyes gleamed with enthusiasm. ""Treasures aplenty, my friend! Silks, spices, jewels that sparkle like the stars in the night sky,"" he exclaimed, momentarily caught up in his own dreams. ""The eastern lands are a treasure trove waiting to be explored, a realm of unimaginable wealth and beauty!""

The customer leaned back, a calculating glint in their eyes. ""And what of this vase, merchant? Could it be considered a treasure in its own right? A symbol of exotic lands and untold stories?""

Hassan pondered their question for a moment, realizing that this customer, with their straightforwardness and direct approach, was different from the usual bargaining style he encountered. His mind raced to find a response that would match their unique perspective. ""Indeed,"" he replied, carefully measuring his words. ""This vase embodies the very essence of the eastern lands. Its craftsmanship tells a tale of skilled artisans, its patterns a glimpse into ancient cultures. It is a treasure, deserving of a journey across the sea.""

The customer's eyes narrowed, their gaze fixed on the vase. Hassan braced himself for their next move, unsure of what to expect. ""And how much would this treasure cost me, good merchant?"" they inquired, their voice steady and unwavering.

Hassan hesitated, his mind whirling as he considered the value of the vase and the uniqueness of this particular encounter. It was a rare opportunity, and he wanted to make the most of it. ""For such a precious item, I could not part with it for anything less than a hundred gold coins,"" he declared, his voice echoing with authority.

To his surprise, the customer's eyes glimmered with amusement as they countered, ""I'll give you twenty gold coins for it.""

Hassan blinked, taken aback by the audacity of the counteroffer. His eyebrows furrowed, his mind racing to comprehend this unorthodox approach. He had expected haggling, but not such an extreme deviation from the usual bargaining process.

""Twenty gold coins? Surely you jest,"" he stammered, his voice betraying a hint of incredulity.

The customer smirked, unyielding in their stance. ""A hundred gold coins is an exorbitant price, merchant. Let us not allow greed to cloud our judgment. This vase is beautiful, no doubt, but I am offering a fair price.""

Hassan's initial surprise soon turned to admiration. This customer, with their directness and boldness, had managed to capture his attention in ways no one else had. Determined to meet their challenge head-on, he took a deep breath and responded, ""Very well, my daring friend. I accept your offer of twenty gold coins, as you are indeed a most intriguing customer.""

As the customer reached into their coin pouch, a sense of excitement and anticipation filled the air. This encounter had deviated from the usual market transactions, unveiling a world of adventure and possibility that Hassan had longed to explore. The customer's confidence and unconventional bargaining style had sparked a flame within him, igniting his desire to embark on new voyages and discover the treasures that awaited beyond the horizon.",1,0.0

Many, many years ago, in those ""good old times"" so much bepraised by antiquaries and the _laudatores temporis acti_,--the good old times, that is to say, of the holy office, of those magnificent _autos_ when the smell of roasted heretics was as sweet a savor in the nostrils of the faithful, as that of Quakers done remarkably brown was to our godly Puritan ancestors,--there dwelt in the royal city of Madrid a wealthy goldsmith by the name of Antonio Perez, whose family--having lost his wife--consisted of a lovely daughter, named Magdalena, and a less beautiful but still charming niece, Juanita. The housekeeping and the care of the girls were committed to a starched old duenna, Donna Margarita, whose vinegar aspect and sharp tongue might well keep at a distance the boldest gallants of the court and camp. For the rest, some half dozen workmen and servitors, and a couple of stout Asturian serving wenches made up the establishment of the wealthy artisan. As the chief care of the latter was to accumulate treasure, his family, while they were denied no comfort, were debarred from luxury, and, perhaps, fared the better from this very frugality of the master. Yet in the stable, which occupied a portion of the basement story of his residence,--the other half being devoted to the _almacen_, or store,--there were a couple of long-tailed Flemish mares, and a heavy, lumbering chariot; and in the rear of the house a garden, enclosed on three sides with a stone wall, and comprising arbors, a fountain, and a choice variety of fruits and flowers. One evening, the goldsmith's daughter and her cousin sat in their apartment, on the second story, peeping out through the closed ""jalousies,"" or blinds, into the twilight street, haply on the watch for some gallant cavalier, whose horsemanship and costume they might admire or criticize. Seeing nothing there, however, to attract their attention, they turned to each other. ""Juanita,"" said the goldsmith's daughter, ""I believe I have secured an admirer."" ""An admirer!"" exclaimed the pretty cousin. ""If your father and dame Margarita didn't keep us cooped here like a pair of pigeons, we should have, at least, twenty apiece. But what manner of man is this phoenix of yours? Is he tall? Has he black eyes, or blue? Is he courtier or soldier?"" ""He is tall,"" replied Magdalena, smiling; ""but for his favor, or the color of his eyes, or quality, I cannot answer. His face and figure shrouded in a cloak, his _sombrero_ pulled down over his eyes, he takes up his station against a pillar of the church whenever I go to San Ildefonso with my duenna, and watches me till mass is ended. I have caught him following our footsteps. But be he gentle or simple, fair or dark, I know not."" ""A very mysterious character!"" cried Juanita, laughing, ""like unto the bravo of some Italian tale. Jesu Maria!"" she exclaimed, springing to the window, ""what goodly cavalier rides hither? His mantle is of three-pile velvet, and he wears golden spurs upon his heels. And with what a grace he sits and manages his fiery genet! Pray Heaven your suitor be as goodly a cavalier."" Magdalena gazed forth upon the horseman, and her heart silently confessed that the praises of her cousin were well bestowed. As the cavalier approached the goldsmith's house, he checked the impatient speed of his horse, and gazed upward earnestly at the window where the young girls sat. ""Magdalena!"" cried the mischievous Juanita, ""old Margarita is not here to document us, and I declare your beauty shall have one chance."" As she spoke she threw open the blind, and exposed her lovely and blushing cousin to the gaze",0,0.0
"Life, death, and the elusive quest for fulfillment. These abstractions weave themselves into the tapestry of our existence, pulling at the very fibers of our being. As I sit here, pen in hand, contemplating the weight of these musings, I am enveloped by a deep sense of introspection. It is within these moments of quiet reflection that the profound questions arise – questions that haunt us all.

Why are we here? What is the purpose of life? How do we find meaning amidst the chaos and uncertainty? These existential quandaries have plagued philosophers and thinkers for centuries, each offering their own theories and interpretations. Yet, here I am, in the solitude of my mind, searching for answers that may never truly be found.

Death, the great equalizer, looms ever present. It is a specter that dances on the periphery of our consciousness, reminding us of our own mortality. And yet, it is this very fragility of life that gives it meaning. Our days are numbered, and knowing this, we strive to make the most of the time we have. We seek to leave our mark on the world, to be remembered, to create something that will outlast our fleeting existence.

But in this pursuit of immortality, we often lose sight of what truly matters. We are bombarded by societal expectations and pressures, constantly striving for success, fame, and material possessions. We are told that happiness lies in the accumulation of wealth or the attainment of power. And yet, deep down, we know that these pursuits are ultimately empty and unfulfilling.

I find myself questioning the values of my hometown, the place that shaped me. The relentless pursuit of status and material gain has left a void, an emptiness within the souls of its inhabitants. It is a place where dreams are crushed under the weight of conformity, where individuality is smothered by the suffocating demands of societal norms. It is a place devoid of depth and introspection, where the illusion of fulfillment is mistaken for true happiness.

In this search for answers, I am confronted by fear. Fear of the unknown, fear of rejection, fear of failure. It is this fear that holds us back, keeping us confined within the boundaries of our comfort zone. But it is only when we face our fears head-on that we truly discover our strength and resilience. It is in those moments of uncertainty that we have the opportunity to forge our own path, to break free from the chains that bind us.

Yet, amidst the despair and uncertainty, there is a glimmer of hope. Hope that there is meaning to be found, that there is purpose in our existence. Hope that we can transcend the limitations of our mortal coil and find fulfillment in the pursuit of truth, beauty, and love. It is this hope that keeps us going, that propels us forward in our search for meaning.

And perhaps, in the search itself, lies the answer. The act of questioning, of exploring, of delving into the depths of our own consciousness is a testament to the human spirit. It is in this relentless pursuit of knowledge and understanding that we find purpose. It is in the journey, rather than the destination, that we discover our own truth – a truth that is uniquely ours, a truth that brings meaning to our lives.

So, as I continue on this journey, grappling with the existential mysteries of life, I am reminded that it is in moments like these, in the quiet recesses of our minds, that we truly come alive. It is here, in the realm of introspection and reflection, that we find solace, inspiration, and the unyielding desire to live a life of purpose and fulfillment.",1,0.0

This is the hour of pride and power, Talon and tush and claw. Oh, hear the call!--Good hunting all That keep the Jungle Law! _Night-Song in the Jungle._ [Illustration] MOWGLI'S BROTHERS IT was seven o'clock of a very warm evening in the Seeonee hills when Father Wolf woke up from his day's rest, scratched himself, yawned, and spread out his paws one after the other to get rid of the sleepy feeling in the tips. Mother Wolf lay with her big gray nose dropped across her four tumbling, squealing cubs, and the moon shone into the mouth of the cave where they all lived. ""Augrh!"" said Father Wolf, ""it is time to hunt again""; and he was going to spring downhill when a little shadow with a bushy tail crossed the threshold and whined: ""Good luck go with you, O Chief of the Wolves; and good luck and strong white teeth go with the noble children, that they may never forget the hungry in this world."" [Illustration: ""'GOOD LUCK GO WITH YOU, O CHIEF OF THE WOLVES.'""] It was the jackal--Tabaqui, the Dish-licker--and the wolves of India despise Tabaqui because he runs about making mischief, and telling tales, and eating rags and pieces of leather from the village rubbish-heaps. They are afraid of him too, because Tabaqui, more than any one else in the jungle, is apt to go mad, and then he forgets that he was ever afraid of any one, and runs through the forest biting everything in his way. Even the tiger hides when little Tabaqui goes mad, for madness is the most disgraceful thing that can overtake a wild creature. We call it hydrophobia, but they call it _dewanee_--the madness--and run. ""Enter, then, and look,"" said Father Wolf, stiffly; ""but there is no food here."" ""For a wolf, no,"" said Tabaqui; ""but for so mean a person as myself a dry bone is a good feast. Who are we, the Gidur-log [the Jackal People], to pick and choose?"" He scuttled to the back of the cave, where he found the bone of a buck with some meat on it, and sat cracking the end merrily. ""All thanks for this good meal,"" he said, licking his lips. ""How beautiful are the noble children! How large are their eyes! And so young too! Indeed, indeed, I might have remembered that the children of kings are men from the beginning."" Now, Tabaqui knew as well as any one else that there is nothing so unlucky as to compliment children to their faces; and it pleased him to see Mother and Father Wolf look uncomfortable. Tabaqui sat still, rejoicing in the mischief that he had made, and then he said spitefully: ""Shere Khan, the Big One, has shifted his hunting-grounds. He will hunt among these hills during the next moon, so he has told me."" Shere Khan was the tiger who lived near the Waingunga River, twenty miles away. ""He has no right!"" Father Wolf began angrily. ""By the Law of the Jungle he has no right to change his quarters without fair warning. He will frighten every head of game within ten miles; and I--I have to kill for two, these days."" ""His mother did not call him Lungri [the Lame One] for nothing,"" said Mother Wolf, quietly. ""He has been lame in one foot from his birth. That is why he has only killed cattle. Now the villagers of the Waingunga are angry with",0,0.0

This was why the young man who opened the sagging gate could not see that it was boarded up, and did not cease his cheerful whistling until he had pressed through the crowding trees and found himself almost on the sunken stone doorstep over which in olden days honeysuckle had been wont to arch. Now only a few straggling, uncared-for vines clung forlornly to the shingles, and the windows were, as has been said, all boarded up. The whistle died on the young man's lips and an expression of blank astonishment and dismay settled down on his face--a good, kindly, honest face it was, although perhaps it did not betoken any pronounced mental gifts on the part of its owner. ""What can have happened?"" he said to himself. ""Uncle Tom and Aunt Sally can't be dead--I'd have seen their deaths in the paper if they was. And I'd a-thought if they'd moved away it'd been printed too. They can't have been gone long--that flower-bed must have been made up last spring. Well, this is a kind of setback for a fellow. Here I've been tramping all the way from the station, a-thinking how good it would be to see Aunt Sally's sweet old face again, and hear Uncle Tom's laugh, and all I find is a boarded-up house going to seed. S'pose I might as well toddle over to Stetsons' and inquire if they haven't disappeared, too."" He went through the old firs back of the lot and across the field to a rather shabby house beyond. A cheery-faced woman answered his knock and looked at him in a puzzled fashion. ""Have you forgot me, Mrs. Stetson? Don't you remember Lovell Stevens and how you used to give him plum tarts when he'd bring your turkeys home?"" Mrs. Stetson caught both his hands in a hearty clasp. ""I guess I haven't forgotten!"" she declared. ""Well, well, and you're Lovell! I think I ought to know your face, though you've changed a lot. Fifteen years have made a big difference in you. Come right in. Pa, this is Lovell--you mind Lovell, the boy Aunt Sally and Uncle Tom had for years?"" ""Reckon I do,"" drawled Jonah Stetson with a friendly grin. ""Ain't likely to forget some of the capers you used to be cutting up. You've filled out considerable. Where have you been for the last ten years? Aunt Sally fretted a lot over you, thinking you was dead or gone to the bad."" Lovell's face clouded. ""I know I ought to have written,"" he said repentantly, ""but you know I'm a terrible poor scholar, and I'd do most anything than try to write a letter. But where's Uncle Tom and Aunt Sally gone? Surely they ain't dead?"" ""No,"" said Jonah Stetson slowly, ""no--but I guess they'd rather be. They're in the poorhouse."" ""The poorhouse! Aunt Sally in the poorhouse!"" exclaimed Lovell. ""Yes, and it's a burning shame,"" declared Mrs. Stetson. ""Aunt Sally's just breaking her heart from the disgrace of it. But it didn't seem as if it could be helped. Uncle Tom got so crippled with rheumatism he couldn't work and Aunt Sally was too frail to do anything. They hadn't any relations and there was a mortgage on the house."" ""There wasn't any when I went away."" ""No; they had to borrow money six years ago when Uncle Tom had his first spell of rheumatic fever. This spring it was clear that there was nothing for them but the poorhouse. They went three months ago and terrible hard they took it, especially Aunt Sally, I felt awful about it myself. Jonah and I would have took them if we could, but we just couldn't--we've nothing but Jonah's wages and we have eight children and not a bit of spare room. I go over to see Aunt Sally as often as I can and take her some little thing, but I dunno's she wouldn't rather not see anybody than see them in the poorhouse."" Lovell weighed his hat in his hands and frowned over it reflectively. ""Who owns the house now?"" ""Peter Townley. He held the mortgage. And all the old furniture was sold too, and that most killed Aunt Sally. But do you know what she's fretting over most of all? She and Uncle Tom will have been married fifty years in a fortnight's time and Aunt Sally thinks it's awful to have to spend their golden wedding anniversary in the poorhouse. She talks about it all the time. You're not going, Lovell""--for Lovell had risen--""you must stop with us, since your old home is closed up. We'll scare you up a shakedown to sleep on and you're welcome as welcome. I haven't forgot the time you caught Mary Ellen just as she was tumbling into the well.""

"Robert Ellsworth Wise Jr. (born January 6, 1948) is an American politician who served as the 33rd Governor of West Virginia from 2001 to 2005. A member of the Democratic Party, Wise also served in the United States House of Representatives from 1983 until 2001. In 2005 Wise became the president of the Alliance for Excellent Education, a nonprofit organization that focuses on reforming the nation's high schools. In 2015, North Carolina State University honored Wise with the William and Ida Friday Institute for Educational Innovation's Friday Medal which recognizes significant, distinguished and enduring contributions to education through advocating innovation, advancing education and imparting inspiration.[1] Wise was born on January 6, 1948. He was raised in the Kanawha Valley of Kanawha County, West Virginia, with his two sisters and attended George Washington High School in nearby Charleston. His father worked in insurance, for McDonough Caperton Group,[2] for thirty years. Wise ran track and field in high school – the half-mile and mile – and was elected vice president of the student body. Wise has won every election he's been in since then.[3] Wise enrolled at Duke University in 1966, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science four years later.[4] After leaving Duke, Wise applied to law school, working as an aide in a California mental health facility until he was accepted at the University of Houston.[5] Wise relocated to Texas for his studies, eventually transferring to the Tulane University School of Law.[6] He waited tables in New Orleans, working nightshifts while he obtained his Juris Doctor. Wise graduated from Tulane in 1975 and opened his first law practice in Charleston. In his early days as a lawyer Wise helped create West Virginians for a Fair and Equitable Assessment of Taxes (FEAT),[7] a group interested in property tax reform. Wise also advocated for coal miners seeking workers compensation and supported community renewal efforts for the 1972 Buffalo Creek disaster[8] victims. In 1978, he once more helped with redevelopment issues for those affected by the Mingo County Floods.[9] Wise began his political career in 1980, running for public office against State Senate President William Brotherton[10] in the County Democratic primary in Kanawha. With endorsement from the West Virginia Education Association and other West Virginian labor organizations, Wise defeated Brotherton in an upset primary election and went on to win the general election in November, gaining a seat in the West Virginia Senate.[11] In his early days on the political scene, Wise was noted for having a lively campaign style,[12] especially at rallies, and was referred to as ""the Boy Wonder of West Virginia politics”[13] by the Charleston Daily Mail in 1982. In 1982, Bob Wise ran for the United States Congress.[14] He came out of a highly competitive Democratic primary victorious and continued on to beat incumbent Republican congressman Mick Staton with 58 percent of the vote.[15] Wise's win against Staton[16] would be the first of nine consecutive elections to the U.S. House of Representatives. During his 18-year turn (1983 – 2001) in the House, Wise ran once unopposed, in 1990, and had majorities as high as 74 percent – in 1988, against Republican Paul Hart – and 64 percent – in 1994 against Republican Samuel Cravotta.[17] While he was a member of Congress, Wise held such posts as regional whip, at-large whip, and parliamentarian.[18] He represented the Second Congressional District which reaches from Harpers Ferry to the Ohio River and is considered to be one of the largest Districts eastward of the Mississippi River.[19] In this same period Wise joined the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, which allowed him to obtain federal aid for road projects in West Virginia. During his time in congress, Wise also served as a member on the House Committee on Education and Labor and on the Democratic Party Leadership team. Among his biggest achievements during this time were the Chemical Right to Know legislation, the Wise Amendment to the Clean Air Act, and the Federal Mental Health Parity legislation.[20] It was during Wise's time in congress that another West Virginian, and at one time the longest-serving member of Congress, Robert C. Byrd, called Wise “a steam engine with britches,” referring to Wise's tireless dedication and service to his constituents.[21] In 2000, after 18 years in congress, Bob Wise left his now secure seat and returned to West Virginia to win the Democratic Primary for governorship with 63 percent of the vote.[22] Wise then went on to challenge Republican incumbent Cecil H. Underwood. Wise highlighted the economy, education,[23] health care, and the energy industry in his campaign speeches. In the end, Wise got just over 50 percent of the vote while Underwood received 47.[24] Wise was sworn in as governor on January 15, 2001, by Circuit Judge Dan O'Hanlon.[25] In his inauguration speech, Wise spoke once more of improving health care and education as well as turning the economy around.[26] Shortly after taking the position of governor, Wise had to deal with widespread flooding in record amounts throughout southern West Virginia.[27] Given a wide berth by the legislature for his handling of the flooding, Wise was able to move forward with his education and health care agendas.[28] In education, Wise pushed for the funding of his Promise (Providing Real Opportunities for Maximizing Instate Student Excellence) scholarships.[29] The program was funded through video lottery revenue,[30] and inspired by the HOPE scholarship program in Georgia. The first Promise scholarships [31] were awarded in 2002 and provided full tuition for students with at least a 3.0 grade point average in high school and a combined SAT Reasoning Test score of 1,000 to attend a state college, university, or in-state private college.[32] By requiring students who'd received the scholarship to complete at least 30 credits per year in order to stay eligible; Promise improved four year graduation rates by 7 percent [33] and the percentage of students leaving the state to pursue post-secondary degrees dropped to the lowest levels since the mid-1990s.

"Bristol County Jail is a historic jail at 48 Court Street in Bristol, Rhode Island, and home to the Bristol Historical and Preservation Society. The jail was built on the site of a previous jail house dating to 1792 and salvaged materials were used extensively in the new construction. The present Bristol County Jail consists of a 36.5-foot-wide (11.1 m) by 46.4-foot-long (14.1 m) center hallway in a 2+1⁄2-story stone structure topped with a gable roof. The jail accommodated both the inmates and the jailer's family. The first floor is believed to have been the family's parlor, dining room and kitchen on the west side and the east side the jailer's reception room, office and storage room. The second floor housed the family's bedrooms and the inmates' cells, with low, medium and maximum security cells. The maximum security cells in the southeast portion of the jail had no heat, light or sanitary facilities and were enclosed by 2-foot (0.61 m) exterior stone walls and built atop thick floor timbers supported by 2-foot-thick (0.61 m) solid brick wall and further supported by a fieldstone wall from the cellar. In 1859, a rectangular 20-foot-wide (6.1 m) by 43.2-foot-long (13.2 m) two-story rear addition was added to common southeast wall of the jail. Made of cut granite blocks and topped with a flat roof, the addition added five cells on each of its two levels. The jail was discontinued by the State of Rhode Island in June 1957 and the Bristol Historical Society (later the Bristol Historical and Preservation Society) leased the property following a fire at the Rogers Free Library. The Bristol Historical Society removed partitions in the first floor and added new access points as part of its renovations, including the removal of the internal east chimney. However, the building retains much of its unaltered interior features, and the jail cells are used by the Society as a public exhibit. The Bristol County Jail was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 and currently serves as the Historical Society headquarters. The current Bristol County Jail was constructed in 1828 to replace a previous jail erected on the same site in 1792. The new structure was a 36.5-foot-wide (11.1 m) by 46.4-foot-long (14.1 m) 2+1⁄2-story stone structure topped with a gable roof.[2] According to the Bristol Historical and Preservation Society the stone came from the ballast of Bristol ships.[3] Material from the original jail was used in the new structure, including the clapboards which were split and reused as laths.[2] The new jail and was constructed for a cost of $3,900.[2] The front facade is five bays wide and faces north on Court Street. The facade originally featured a recessed Greek Revival entrance that was replaced with a newer door and extended by a Victorian hood. At the time of its National Register of Historic Places nomination in 1973, all the windows except one on the second story were changed from the twelve-over-eight and twelve-over twelve sashes to the two-over-two Victorian sash. In 1959, the Bristol Historical Society removed the internal east chimney on the first floor as part of renovations.[2] The 1828 construction features a central hall with three rooms on the east and west sides of roughly symmetrical construction with chimneys at the intersection of the front and middle rooms. The first floor chimneys were flanked by doors allowing access to the other rooms and storage on the other side. The layout and usage of the jail is not known for certain, but it is believed that the rooms to the west were used by the jailer and his family. The first room as a parlor, the middle as the dining room and the rear room as the kitchen. As part of the renovations in 1959, the Society changed the parlor to a research room, the dining room into a library and added a door to the stairway from the kitchen.[2] The front research room and library retain the original fireplaces, pine floorboards and closets, but the connecting passage between the two rooms were changed to a bathroom. The east side of the jail is believed to have been used by the jailer for his occupational duties, with the front room as a public reception room and the middle room as his office. The rear room in the back may have been used for record or other storage. After leasing the property, the Society removed the partitions in the rooms that separated the rooms from each other.[2] The second floor is arranged differently from the first floor, with the rooms above the front parlor and reception room believed to have been the bedroom for the jailer and his family. The west room is described as ""quite elegant in its simplicity with its original wainscot and cornice of run mouldings"".[2] The middle room may have been a low-security cell; evidence of this comes from the two windows which have iron bar markings in the granite sills. Also, the NRHP nomination states that the room, 13.2 feet (4.0 m) wide by 20.6 feet (6.3 m) long, may have been divided into two cells.[2] The rear allows access to a small hallway and to the attic, but this was described as being a later modification.[2] The east front bedroom is divided in two with a partition, giving the eastern side of the building four rooms on the second floor, with the two middle rooms being used as medium-security cells. The maximum security cells were located in the back of the building, in the south-east corner. These cells are constructed of wood and walled in by stone walls and iron doors. The maximum security cells had no heat, light or bathrooms; air was only able to flow into the room through a slit in the stone wall and a peep hole in the iron door. Underneath the cells were two courses of 8 inches (0.20 m) by 8 inches (0.20 m) timbers superimposed on top of one another. These timbers are",0,0.0
"like saucers skimming across the water. That's what made me think they were genuine. And they didn't seem to be going fast enough so that I'd expect to hear a roar like a jet-plane. ""It struck me that this might not be the way they fly, naturally, but the way they might fly if the pilots were having trouble adjusting the controls to a heavier atmosphere than they were used to."" Clayton tapped the tabletop with his fingers. ""What about you, Marty? Did you see three ships?"" Big Gene Marty, football star, was the least nervous. ""Can't be sure about _ships_, Doc,"" he rumbled. ""I did see something strange disappearing over the horizon. It--I mean they--might have been what Tony says; but whatever it was, there were three of them. But I saw something else, because I was looking in another direction. What I saw first was a couple of funny-looking shapes floating down near the ground. Didn't look like parachutists, yet they seemed big enough to be men--or at least, small men."" ""Interesting. All right, what about the rest of you? How many saw the ships?"" * * * * * A chorus answered him. ""I see,"" Clayton mused. ""You all agree on the behavior. And you all think there were three--not four--not two. Three?"" It was agreed. Clayton rustled the pile of newspapers. ""The reports in here vary. I learn with amazement that you gentlemen seem to have missed completely the spurts of flame that issued from the alien ships--flame which is reported to have set a house on fire. And no one seems to have noticed that the invaders, in descending, glided on huge black wings."" Corelli blushed a fiery crimson. ""Dr. Clayton,"" he protested, ""we aren't making these things up for popular consumption. We're just telling you what we actually saw--that is--what--what--we--saw looked like to us."" Clayton nodded. ""Of course. That is all people were doing back in 1938 when the Martians landed in New Jersey, at the time Orson Welles presented a radio version of H. G. Wells' 'War of the Worlds'. Or when the 'Flying Saucer' craze first started. Or when Fantafilm put on their big publicity stunt for the improved 3-D movie, 'The Outsiders', and people saw the aliens over Broadway and heard them address the populace in weird, booming tones. ""Gentlemen, I am not pleased to find students of this University engaging in such unwanted extra-curricular activity as inventing interplanetary scares. I don't think Washington will be amused, either."" Corelli clicked his heels. ""Sir,"" he stated in dignified tones, ""I resent these implications. I assume they have been directed at me. At no time have I talked about this to reporters, or in any way engaged in what you accuse me of. If you want my resignation from this school, you may have it."" ""Really? You think that an air of dignified innocence will undo the damage done? I am well aware of your experiments with the _y_ wave, gentlemen--and it was on the _y_ wave that the messages came. You may be interested to know that the number of lives lost, the property damage, the business losses due to the panic, have not yet been fully determined; but it makes the hysteria following the Fantafilm hoax very small potatoes by comparison. ""You may withdraw now, gentlemen; this affair will be discussed at greater length later, regardless of what the FBI decides. I had hoped that the main culprit would try to save unwitting accomplices from a measure of grief. That is all."" The seven students left Dr. Clayton's office in record time. * * * * * Professor Elton rapped the table for silence. ""Gentlemen,"" he began, ""Dr. Clayton and I both extend our sincere apologies."" He smiled wanly. ""Of course, that does not exonerate anyone from the charge of gullibility. But Harvey Gale's confession has been fully confirmed by the FBI, and you--and this University--have been cleared. The public knows now that your testimony helped lead to the facts in the case. ""To me, the most interesting feature of this business is the fact that Gale was able to put over this hoax, despite the fact that the public had been taken in three times before. The Orson Welles scare rode on a wave of war-hysteria; the Flying Saucer craze followed world war; the Fantafilm hoax came when the world was still in dread of sudden bombings. But the Gale Hoax--what can we call it but what is loosely known as the continuing gullibility of human beings? ""We trust that this demonstration you have just observed will help you to remember that while seeing may be believing, it's wise not to believe until it has been established just what you saw."" * * * * * In his private office, Dr. Clayton leaned forward over his desk. Or, to be more exact, something that looked like Dr. Clayton leaned over the desk. The face was impassive as marble, but, from out a slit in his chest, a pair of black antennae-like feelers were vibrating into a framed picture on the wall, from which the picture had been slid aside. _""Landing safely effected. Brief panic when several Terrestrials sighted ships; all clear now. Full report, containing details on latest successful persuasion of Earthlings that Martians or other aliens are imaginary, will follow.""_ From the speaker beneath the desk came sounds of gasps, heavy breathing, then shuffling footsteps. Clayton pushed the picture back into place, then took off the skin-painted vest he wore, with the flat box on its inside. He snapped a switch on the side of his desk.

Main-Travelled Roads Foreword xi Introduction 1 A Branch Road 7 Up the Coolly 67 Among the Corn-Rows 131 The Return of a Private 167 Under the Lion's Paw 195 The Creamery Man 219 A Day's Pleasure 245 Mrs. Ripley's Trip 261 Uncle Ethan Ripley 281 God's Ravens 301 A ""Good-Fellow's"" Wife 327 Foreword In the summer of 1887, after having been three years in Boston, and six years absent from my old home in northern Iowa, I found myself with money enough to pay my railway fare to Ordway, South Dakota, where my father and mother were living, and as it cost very little extra to go by way of Dubuque and Charles City, I planned to visit Osage, Iowa, and the farm we had opened on Dry Run prairie in 1871. Up to this time I had written only a few poems, and some articles descriptive of boy life on the prairie, although I was doing a good deal of thinking and lecturing on land reform, and was regarded as a very intense disciple of Herbert Spencer and Henry George--a singular combination, as I see it now. On my way westward, that summer day in 1887, rural life presented itself from an entirely new angle. The ugliness, the endless drudgery, and the loneliness of the farmer's lot smote me with stern insistence. I was the militant reformer. The farther I got from Chicago the more depressing the landscape became. It was bad enough in our former home in Mitchell County, but my pity grew more intense as I passed from northwest Iowa into southern Dakota. The houses, bare as boxes, dropped on the treeless plains, the barbed-wire fences running at right angles, and the towns mere assemblages of flimsy wooden sheds with painted-pine battlement, produced on me the effect of an almost helpless and sterile poverty. My dark mood was deepened into bitterness by my father's farm, where I found my mother imprisoned in a small cabin on the enormous sunburned, treeless plain, with no expectation of ever living anywhere else. Deserted by her sons and failing in health, she endured the discomforts of her life uncomplainingly--but my resentment of ""things as they are"" deepened during my talks with her neighbors who were all housed in the same unshaded cabins in equal poverty and loneliness. The fact that at twenty-seven I was without power to aid my mother in any substantial way added to my despairing mood. My savings for the two years of my teaching in Boston were not sufficient to enable me to purchase my return ticket, and when my father offered me a stacker's wages in the harvest field I accepted and for two weeks or more proved my worth with the fork, which was still mightier--with me--than the pen. However, I did not entirely neglect the pen. In spite of the dust and heat of the wheat ricks I dreamed of poems and stories. My mind teemed with subjects for fiction, and one Sunday morning I set to work on a story which had been suggested to me by a talk with my mother, and a few hours later I read to her (seated on the low sill of that treeless cottage) the first two thousand words of Mrs. Ripley's Trip, the first of the series of sketches which became Main Travelled Roads. I did not succeed in finishing it, however, till after my return to Boston in September. During the fall and winter of '87 and the winter and spring of '88, I wrote the most of the stories in Main Travelled Roads, a novelette for the Century Magazine, and a play called ""Under the Wheel."" The actual work of the composition was carried on in the south attic room of Doctor Cross's house at 21 Seaverns Avenue, Jamaica Plain. The mood of bitterness in which these books were written was renewed and augmented by a second visit to my parents in 1889, for during my stay my mother suffered a stroke of paralysis due to overwork and the dreadful heat of the summer. She grew better before the time came for me to return to my teaching in Boston, but I felt like a sneak as I took my way to the train leaving my mother and sister on that bleak and sun-baked plain. ""Old Paps Flaxen,"" ""Jason Edwards,"" ""A Spoil of Office,"" and most of the stories gathered into the second volume of Main Travelled Roads were written in the shadow of these defeats. If they seem unduly austere, let the reader remember the times in which they were composed. That they were true of the farms of that day no one can know better than I, for I was there--a farmer. Life on the farms of Iowa and Wisconsin--even on the farms of Dakota--has gained in beauty and security, I will admit, but there are still wide stretches of territory in Kansas and Nebraska where the farmhouse is a lonely shelter. Groves and lawns, better roads, the rural free delivery, the telephone, and the motor car have done much to",0,0.0

"Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a potent neurotoxin. Its name derives from Tetraodontiformes, an order that includes pufferfish, porcupinefish, ocean sunfish, and triggerfish; several of these species carry the toxin. Although tetrodotoxin was discovered in these fish and found in several other animals (e.g., in blue-ringed octopuses, rough-skinned newts, and moon snails), it is actually produced by certain infecting or symbiotic bacteria like Pseudoalteromonas, Pseudomonas, and Vibrio as well as other species found in animals.[1][2] Although it produces thousands of intoxications annually and several deaths,[3] it has shown efficacy for the treatment of cancer-related pain in phase II and III clinical trials.[4] Tetrodotoxin is a sodium channel blocker. It inhibits the firing of action potentials in neurons by binding to the voltage-gated sodium channels in nerve cell membranes and blocking the passage of sodium ions (responsible for the rising phase of an action potential) into the neuron. This prevents the nervous system from carrying messages and thus muscles from contracting in response to nervous stimulation.[5] Its mechanism of action, selective blocking of the sodium channel, was shown definitively in 1964 by Toshio Narahashi and John W. Moore at Duke University, using the sucrose gap voltage clamp technique.[6] Apart from their bacterial species of most likely ultimate biosynthetic origin (see below), tetrodotoxin has been isolated from widely differing animal species, including:[1] Tarichatoxin was shown to be identical to TTX in 1964 by Mosher et al.,[12][13] and the identity of maculotoxin and TTX was reported in Science in 1978,[14] and the synonymity of these two toxins is supported in modern reports (e.g., at Pubchem[15] and in modern toxicology textbooks[16]) though historic monographs questioning this continue in reprint.[17] The toxin is variously used by metazoans as a defensive biotoxin to ward off predation, or as both a defensive and predatory venom (e.g., in octopuses, chaetognaths, and ribbon worms).[18] Even though the toxin acts as a defense mechanism, some predators such as the common garter snake have developed insensitivity to TTX, which allows them to prey upon toxic newts.[19] The association of TTX with consumed, infecting, or symbiotic bacterial populations within the metazoan species from which it is isolated is relatively clear;[1] presence of TTX-producing bacteria within a metazoan's microbiome is determined by culture methods, the presence of the toxin by chemical analysis, and the association of the bacteria with TTX production by toxicity assay of media in which suspected bacteria are grown.[2] As Lago et al. note, ""there is good evidence that uptake of bacteria producing TTX is an important element of TTX toxicity in marine metazoans that present this toxin.""[2] TTX-producing bacteria include Actinomyces, Aeromonas, Alteromonas, Bacillus, Pseudomonas, and Vibrio species;[2] in the following animals, specific bacterial species have been implicated:[1] The association of bacterial species with the production of the toxin is unequivocal – Lago and coworkers state, ""[e]ndocellular symbiotic bacteria have been proposed as a possible source of eukaryotic TTX by means of an exogenous pathway,""[2] and Chau and coworkers note that the ""widespread occurrence of TTX in phylogenetically distinct organisms… strongly suggests that symbiotic bacteria play a role in TTX biosynthesis""[1] – although the correlation has been extended to most but not all metazoans in which the toxin has been identified.[1][2][5] To the contrary, there has been a failure in a single case, that of newts (Taricha granulosa), to detect TTX-producing bacteria in the tissues with highest toxin levels (skin, ovaries, muscle), using PCR methods,[24] although technical concerns about the approach have been raised.[1] Critically for the general argument, Takifugu rubripes puffers captured and raised in laboratory on controlled, TTX-free diets ""lose toxicity over time,"" while cultured, TTX-free Takifugu niphobles puffers fed on TTX-containing diets saw TTX in the livers of the fishes increase to toxic levels.[1] Hence, as bacterial species that produce TTX are broadly present in aquatic sediments, a strong case is made for ingestion of TTX and/or TTX-producing bacteria, with accumulation and possible subsequent colonization and production.[1] Nevertheless, without clear biosynthetic pathways (not yet found in metazoans, but shown for bacteria),[25] it remains uncertain whether it is simply via bacteria that each metazoan accumulates TTX; the question remains as to whether the quantities can be sufficiently explained by ingestion, ingestion plus colonization, or some other mechanism.[1][2][5] Tetrodotoxin binds to what is known as site 1 of the fast voltage-gated sodium channel.[26] Site 1 is located at the extracellular pore opening of the ion channel. The binding of any molecules to this site will temporarily disable the function of the ion channel, thereby blocking the passage of sodium ions into the nerve cell (which is ultimately necessary for nerve conduction); neosaxitoxin and several of the conotoxins also bind the same site. The use of this toxin as a biochemical probe has elucidated two distinct types of voltage-gated sodium channels present in mammals: tetrodotoxin-sensitive voltage-gated sodium channels (TTX-s Na+ channels) and tetrodotoxin-resistant voltage-gated sodium channels (TTX-r Na+ channels). Tetrodotoxin inhibits TTX-s Na+ channels at concentrations of around 1–10 nM,[27] whereas micromolar concentrations of tetrodotoxin are required to inhibit TTX-r Na+ channels.[28] Nerve cells containing TTX-r Na+ channels are located primarily in cardiac tissue, while nerve cells containing TTX-s Na+ channels dominate the rest of the body. TTX and its analogs have historically been important agents for use as chemical tool compounds, for use in channel characterization and in fundamental studies of channel function.[29][30] The prevalence of TTX-s Na+ channels in the central nervous system makes tetrodotoxin a valuable agent for the silencing of neural activity within a cell culture. The biosynthetic route to TTX is only partially understood. It is long known that the molecule is related to saxitoxin, and as of 2011 it is believed that there are separate routes for aquatic (bacterial) and terrestrial (newt) TTX.[31] In 2020, new intermediates found in newts suggest that the synthesis starts with geranyl guanidine in the amphibian; these intermediates were not found in aquatic TTX-containing animals, supporting the separate-route theory.[32] In 2021, the first genome of a TTX-producing bacterium was produced. This ""Bacillus sp. 1839"" was identified as Cytobacillus gottheilii using",0,0.0
"Its summer here in gold old California and the SUV drivers of the Golden State are loading up their camping gear and heading out. Like them, my vacation plans have been made. For 8 blissful days I will be camped out at a beach and, although camping trips have been routine for me over the past seven years, I must admit that I'm tired of overstuffing my little Honda Civic with gear and tying crap down on the roof rack as well. My vacation destination is less than an hour away and yet because my camping compadre is a 7 year old princess I have to pack everything (including the portable kitchen sink). My car has taken a fierce beating because of this. It has gotten to the point now that when our little trips end, I only unpack the tent, air mattress, and porta-potty (yes, her majesty requires a portapotty!). The rest of the goods just stay in the car because of the weekend day trips and evening jaunts to the lake in the hills behind our home. My theory is then that because I have all this stuff in my car, I should allow myself the luxury of a new car. Right? Well......sorry folks but I am going to subject you to my torturous list of pros and cons. Let this be your insight to my amazingly indecisive nature! First of all let's tackle this princess issue. When I was a kid we were allowed to pack one bag for a camping trips. Being the youngest of five kids I had it pretty good because what ever I didn't have room for, one of the other kids was sure to bring along anyways. My daughter may not have that luxury because I'm not brave enough to have more kids (what if they are ALL like her?!!) but I think she needs to have a couple of boundaries here. One of those boundaries should be the portapotty. Sooner or later the kid has got to realize that germs are germs are germs!!! They are on this toilet or that toilet - they are everywhere. The solution to germs are not avoidint public restrooms but SOAP AND WATER (which coincidentally are much easier to pack than porta potties). Flushing the portapotty out of the car shouldn't be such a terriffic battle (no pun intended!). Than there is the air mattress - I mean COME ON!!! How many kids had this luxury on camping trips??!!!! My parents idea of a air mattress was the patch of ground with the most pine needles - as it should be. Ixnay on the mattressay!!! Than there are the beach toys - granted they ARE a necessity - but the quantity???!!! Lets have one bucket, one shovel and one sifter - and that will suffice. Perhaps I can convince my darling girl to leave the rest of the toys in the store for the OTHER kids!!! Yes, my little girl is going to have to get the tough love session on this next camping trip.... perhaps I'll let her know that either the stuff goes or she goes???!!!!! In all fairness though, I must blame this spoiled nature of her on her grandparents - and trust me, I have every right to lay blame there because they happily accept it! Next there is the actual mechanics of the car. This is a 10 year old car, that has never missed a major or minor service. The engine is in extremely good condition (it is spared the child's havoc) and give me no cause for worry. With nearly 145,000 miles on it, I'm told by fellow members of the ""Civic Nation"" that I can easily get another 100K out ofit. The mileage I get out of The Trusty Turtle (this name is due more to the drivers aversion to speeding tickets than the actual car) is far better I know than the mileage I could get out of any new car with more cargo space. The Subaru Forrester has killer cargo space but is a gashog. My wallet doesn't like gashogs and neither does my affection for the environment. Then there is the money. Money's funny honey. The trick here is that I own The Trusty Turtle. Own as in paid for, pink slip in my name, my first constructive financial commitment! Monthly car payments are something I haven't dealt with in two years and its not something I'm looking forward to ever again! Naturally I don't miss the insurance payments either because I've found that as the OWNER of my car, I can afford full coverage at the same rate as an UNOWNED car's liability only rate. You can't go wrong with that! Seeing as I live in California I would also have to contend with the OUTRAGEOUS registration fees - I'm only paying 45 dollars a year to register the Trusty Turtle and I can't walk away from the diabolical joy I get out of listening to people moan and groan about how much they pay to register their new cars. Those are all pretty decent pro's right? Alas, here are my cons. They are childish at best, so be aware that I am fully aware of that! First off there is the color. You would think my Trusty Turtle is green or some olive shade, yes? Think again.... its a dull blah red. Not my favorite color. The rear bumper is actually maroon thanks to some crazy lady who tapped my bumer two months into my possession of the carand no body shop has ever matched my flat dull red color. You see, when I bought this car I was driving a practically home made VW bug and it wasn't exactly baby proof - so because I was in a bit of a bind and too stupid to know better I bought the first slightly used Civic I came across - which turned out to be my Trusty Turtle.

Rock on, flight attendant lady, we love you. urlLink This is us after a few hours in the airport. Let's just say that we all smelled, well, quite aweful after a long time of traveling. Planes smell bad. Molly re-deoderizes, and saves us all from her stench. Note Brett's expression. Is he offended by Molly's smell? Nah, he's just tired. No drama here, sorry guys. urlLink NOT AMUSED! But we made it! Molly and I are on a train from Rome to Naples, where we would meet Mr. Slipek. No wait, Mr. Slipek was on the train. Yeah, where we would meet Mr. Ross and the rest of the kids. Those lucky bastards who made it. Anyway, this is us completely looking and feeling completely like shit. again, why do I post this? I know not. But note the snazzy new $10 watch my mom got me from Target. It broke, the jerk. But oh well. I think this is the last Polo picture, I am afraid, because we smell so bad that these clothes went directly into a bag I labeled ""Condemned!"" and were not brought out of it again until I got home. Man did they stink. Alright, enough about the stinking. urlLink My first ever view of..... that's right...... ITALY!!!! so we made it. Note the, uh, glare from the flash on the left. and the uh, mountains.... i think.... and uh..... anyway, this train ride was so amazing, it was one of the best parts of the trip because I got to take in Italy's beautiful scenery all at once, and while everybody on the train was sleeping I just kept looking out the window in awe, it was so cool. the scenery was this dramatic, there were aqueducts in front of mountains and cliffs and the mountains went up into these rolling puffy clouds and you couldn't see the tops. And the coolest thing about it was the yellow tint to everything, it seemed like another planet. It was so increadibly beautiful, I was so so thankful to finally be there. Despite my expression in the last picture of utter fatigue. urlLink We reuinite with the oh so fragrant and showered Sara Warren, and then we showered, and this is the view from our room. I'm talkin Ruins, Ocean, and yes, even powerlines. We had our own balcony. Did I meantion we were showered? That is why we are so damn happy. Besides the fact that we finally made it to the most beautiful place ever. This is ""The Villa"" outside of Naples, and Mr. Ross's favorite place we stay. I like it Because of the Eggs in the morning, which is what I can eat. Actually I like it for the general food. Its really good. Mmmm, showered. Clean clothes. You have no idea just how good they felt. urlLink The roomies. And Sam Blankenship. Who is quite Awesome. This is just our room again. It was a really nice room, too, if i do say",0,0.0
"Anyone who spent any time in the mid-90's in Monterey, California, may remember the reputation of Bruce Archer. He was generally well-liked by everyone, but he did have one little personality quirk: in a squadron of 700+ college-age military trainees, he was a notorious drinker. The vast majority of our student body liked to party, but he stood out. When other people would go to the bars in town, they would usually order a beer. Sometimes a pint. Bruce would order a pitcher. Then he would ask whoever he was with, ""Do you want one, too?"" Generally speaking, he didn't let this habit affect his Air Force career. Okay, it would be more accurate to say he didn't let the Air Force interfere with his drinking career. You could guarantee that every night, from Friday to Sunday, he was going to be publicly intoxicated. Holidays and ""Blood Days"" - we were given a day off from class if we donated to the periodic blood drives - would allow him to extend his drinking time further into the week. The collection of Drunken Archer stories grew over his vast tenure at DLI, especially when he was rolled back. Usually people were only rolled back for academic reasons; if they couldn't keep up, they would get transferred into a class that was two months or more behind theirs in the program. Bruce was rolled back because he had an un-descended testicle that the USAF had decided must be removed. This extended his stay at DLI by almost a year after recovery time, convalescent leave, and finding him an open seat in a new class in his language. Meanwhile, his adventures continued. His favorite trick was to get himself obliterated, and then evacuate himself in some inappropriate place. When Bruce was drunk, he would piss and crap anywhere, as the spirit moved him. Pun intended. His squad-mates complained to him frequently about not urinating in the flight laundry room. James went so far as to ask him to use the washing machine, as it was easier to clean than the dryer. This led to a knock on James' door in the middle of the night: it was Bruce, asking for some laundry soap so he could ""flush."" Perhaps his greatest moment came when he was staggering up the hill from the Enlisted Club one Saturday night, and felt his bowels beginning to move. He was on the tennis courts, about half-way up to the squadron from the E-Club; he couldn't go back there, since they had just closed. He didn't think he'd make it up the hill, and he didn't fancy squatting there in the open on a moonlit night. So he did what anyone in his position would have done; he snuck into one of the front yards of the officers' quarters that bordered the tennis courts. As he did his business behind a bush under the picture window, he noticed that the car parked out front looked familiar, and he squinted at the name on the mailbox: Guillanara. He realized with glee that he was shitting in the Air Force commander's yard! He proudly told a captivated audience this tale while sitting on my couch at a party sometime later, and then promptly fell into a deep sleep. We, of course, rolled him outside to keep him from taking a dump in our oven, or someplace even worse. Then there was the incident with his roommate, Morgan Waldo. Morgan was a good guy, originally. I have to admit that I started him on his slide into sadistic cruelty by stealing his girlfriend, or so he believed. He was even more crushed when I married her, but it wasn't me that pushed him over the edge! One weekend, just before the monthly Monday morning inspection, Waldo was livid. It was Sunday night, and Archer was still, typically, MIA, presumably at the Mucky Duck, or Characters. Waldo had to clean the whole room by himself. Okay, he didn't HAVE to, but he thought he'd fail the inspection if Bruce's junk was scattered all over the place. About 3am, Archer was poured out of a cab, and the dorm guard on duty rousted Joe, the flight commander, and another poor sap - both were volunteer student leaders, I must point out - to drag Bruce down the hall to his room. As they did so, he woke up, and began flailing about. He only settled down after bouncing his head off the laundry room doorknob. They pounded on his door, waking Waldo, who had only just gotten to bed after cleaning, sweeping, and re-waxing the floor of the room. They all dumped Archer on his bed (the bottom bunk, fortunately) and Waldo attempted to get back to sleep. Just as he drifted off, he heard something, and turned on the light. He saw Archer standing in the middle of the room, spraying copious amounts of urine all over their shoes, which Morgan had lined up neatly along the wall under the window. Waldo launched out of the top bunk, pummelled Bruce on the back, and shoved him toward the door, shrieking ""No, you stupid bastard! Get out of here to do that!"" So, Archer opened the door to the room and gamely obliged by whizzing out into the hallway. He finished as Waldo danced a jig of rage behind him, and then lay back down to sleep - on his desk. The desks were side by side against the wall, so while Bruce was trying to rest his banged-up head on his desk, his feet were on Waldo's. The problem here was that Waldo had a shelf unit on his desk, which was loaded with books and language tapes, knick knacks and CDs, and other neatly tidied junk that tends to accumulate on such shelves. Bruce kicked the whole mess onto the floor. Hearing the crash, Waldo rushed back into the room from the hallway, where he had been frantically mopping up piss with",0,0.0

After reading in someone else's blog that nice guys only like the bitchy sluts who take advantage of them, how there are many fake nice girls that put their nice guy friends through torture, and how nobody thinks of the genuine nice girls, I realized a few things. First of all, I think I speak for all the nice guys out there when I say that all nice guys are stupid. We can't tell if the bitchy sluts are acting or not. They could be the worse actors in the world and we couldn't tell if that was the real them or just a bad performance. Second, there are people that think about the nice girls, which is why I am writing this post right now... What? There's nothing else I wanted to mention before I get into the meat of the update. I'm not going to deny that the nice guys always like the bitchy sluts, we do always like them. So your thinking, ""Are there really nice girls out there?"" Well, of course. They're the girls that only like the hunky jocks who take advantage of them. They're the one's that get put through torture by the many fake nice guys which are hunky jocks. They're the ones that always finish second to first. They already have several innate advantages: They don't have to act to be nice and every guy, no matter how gay, will always be attracted to a nice girl. Even though they have these advantages, they have one major flaw that will make them always finsh in second place: Just like nice guys, they are too shy to tell the hunky jock that they obsess over and stalk that they like him. The other bitchy slut will always get the hunky jock before the nice girl. Even if the nice girl gathered enough courage to tell the hunky jock that she likes him, the hunky jock will just say the six dread words that every nice guy and girl despises: ""I just want to be friends."" But, no matter what happens, the hunky jock will always come back to the nice girl because the nice girl is his ""friend."" Before I go, I want to present the nice girl version of the unspoken, until now, unwritted rules. These set of rules are somewhat original,they have never been seen by the general public. Here they are: Do fantasize about telling him your deepest feelings towards him, prompting him to reveal similar feelings towards you, upon which the two of you will immediately engage in passionate and fulfilling lovemaking. Do not actually do this. Do listen to entirely too many sappy love songs, especially R where almost every song is about a women who can't get any loving. Do paste the lyrics to those songs in your AIM profile or online journal where nobody will ever read them, but do it anyway becasue you ""love"" him and want people to know with out actually telling them. Do not actually sing these songs to him, as your voice is terrible. Do alienate the rest of your friends when they become concerned about your depression. Pretend that your problems aren't about a guy, even though they are because you would rather have him than all of your friends combined. Do drive him around everywhere when he needs to run errands even though you are really busy and will get expelled/fired from school/work. Do let him tell you that ""you're such a nice girl."" Do not wash your car after he sits in it. Do do bad in your math and physics classes so you can spend all your free time letting a stupid hunky jock tutor you. Do not learn the material, even if he isn't in your class, so that he can tutor you and you have an excuse to be with him. Do have a hidden agenda that you will never get to. Do fantasize about telling him your deepest feelings towards him as he is trying to tutor you, prompting him to reveal similar feelings towards you, upon which the two of you will immediately engage in passionate and fulfilling lovemaking. Do not actually expect that to happen because it will not. Do start sweating and gibbering like an idiot anytime you're around him because you are a sweaty, gibbering idiot. Do listen to him tell you about a great girl he just met. Do listen to him complain about his bitchy slut of a girlfriend the next day. Do listen to him tell you that he wishes she was more like you. Do tell her that everything will work out between him and his bitchy slut of a girlfriend. Do shred your intestines by swallowing a chainsaw afterwards. Do realize that there is a difference between a nice girl and a pansy. Do not realize that you are definately a pansy. Do attempt to forget about him. Avoid him as much",0,0.0
"THERE WERE MANY children in our neighborhood, although, for me, this comprised only the distance along the street between two Meralco electric light posts. Sometimes, we strayed farther, as when a kite string snapped; if the wind were strong we would even go across the railway track, which was unfenced in those days. Entong was a rascal and we were all afraid of him. We called him Cutil Butil because he had a growth of some kind near his right ear the size of a grain of corn; he didn’t seem to mind the nickname, being used to it. When in one of our games he had been winning and was beginning to lose, he would get up and say: “I don’t like to play anymore. My mother might be calling me.” And then he would scurry off. I tried the same trick on him once, but he accompanied me to our house and cried real, big tears at the foot of the stairs, telling my mother that I had run away with his shells. Mother would not listen to me, and I had to return the shells I had won from him. We could not tell Entong’s mother about him. She was a widow and a drunkard. Most of the day she plucked cankong, a kind of vegetable [that] she sold in the market, in the wet fields along the railroad track. Besides Entong, she had a number of other children[,] two of whom were married but still lived with her in the little one-room house. When she drunk callejon with her skirt stained with the mud of the wet fields and the green of the cankong leaves, shouting bad words at everybody. Sometimes, I saw her take a bath. Her hair was short and grey and her breasts were withered. When the children cried at night, their mothers would say: “Stop, now, stop. Here comes Apung Enchang!” And the little creatures would stop crying for fear. Then there was Bo, whom we called Cusing because he was so small and frail. He made you think of a half-centavo. He could not fight, and often would go home crying. When the ground was muddy, he would frequently slip and tumble down. Entong was always cheating him. Another boy lived just in front of our house across the callejon—in the house with the electric lights. We used only a kerosene lamp. Unlike the rest of us, he always wore regular pants, and sometimes he would come out and play, very clean and with powder all over his face. He looked like a girl to us, and, in fact, he often played with the girls, especially with the little mestiza girl with the bobbed hair who spoke Spanish. Oning was her name. We called him Bacla. He hated the nickname very much. His real name was Yoyong. His father was a clerk—a chief clerk, I think. When he came home from the office in the afternoon he always had bundles of large[,] brown [envelopes] with him. He smoked big cigars. When he talked with Oning’s father[,] they spoke in Spanish. They would laugh loudly and shrug their shoulders, looking very wise. My father, as he sewed in his chair near our window, would peer at them through his glasses, and sometimes[,] he[,] too[,] would smile. He could also speak Spanish. He had been a soldier during the Spanish times. Now[,] was only a tailor. I often wondered why. Every once in a while[,] there would be a party at Yoyong’s house. Pigs and chickens would be killed, and I would carry water for them. I was paid three centavos for every two cans. For drinking water, I received ten centavos, because the artesian well was quite a distance off. On one such occasion, when I was about to go, Yoyong gave me a slice of bread with butter on it. I was ashamed to take it because my mother had said… but it looked good to me, so I took it and ate it in our back yard. Entong saw me, and looking at me kindly, offered me some of his shells. He looked very ugly as he stood staring at my bread, and I pitied him. I finally gave him a piece, rather reluctantly, saying, “When you have something to eat, you do not give me any!” For a few days after that, Entong did not try to cheat me, but later he began cheating again. One day[,] he was run over by a calesa and almost died as a result. He was taken to a hospital and when he was well again[,] it seemed that he was more quiet than before. Anong, my younger brother, was a good marbles player. None of us liked to play with him, not even Entong who dared not cheat him because when Anong fought[,] he always used his teeth. There were other little boys—one whom we called Galis because he was almost covered with some kind of itch and was always scratching himself. Sometimes he would bleed in several places and would begin to cry. He was thin and pale. His mother worked in a factory. His father—I really never knew who his father was, there were so many men in their house. Galis stayed home most of the time, sitting on the stairs, very silent. One time[,] I saw him smile. Years later, I saw that same smile for the second time. He was pulling weeds in the greens around the Walled City, under a heavy guard. I recognized him and smiled, and he smiled back at me—the same smile I had seen years before as he sat, sick and thin, on the stairs in front of his house. My brother who played marbles so well died when he was fourteen. He spat so much blood. We had all loved him very much, and we were all very sad. For three nights, Yoyong’s father lent us some of his electric lights connected",0,0.0
"Tremont sat in the cramped cockpit of his small rocket ship, staring out into the vast expanse of space. He loved the solitude of interstellar travel, the quiet hum of the engines, and the infinite possibilities that awaited him in the great unknown. As a trader, his ship was his lifeline, his means of exploring distant planets and making a living.

His routine was well established. Every morning, Tremont would check the ship's systems, ensuring that everything was in working order. He would then chart his course for the day, selecting the planets he would visit and the goods he hoped to acquire or sell. The ship's computer would calculate the most efficient routes, taking into account various factors such as fuel consumption and the market demand for different goods.

On this particular day, Tremont's first stop was a small mining colony on a distant moon. The miners there were always eager for supplies, and Tremont had a surplus of food and water. He knew he could fetch a good price for his cargo, allowing him to replenish his own supplies and make a tidy profit.

As he approached the moon, Tremont carefully guided his ship into the atmosphere, fighting against the gravitational pull. Once landed, he made his way to the colony's central trading hub, where he found himself surrounded by bustling miners, all eager to strike a deal.

Negotiations were always an art, and Tremont prided himself on his ability to read people. He had a keen eye for spotting the eager buyers looking for a quick deal and the cautious sellers who knew the value of their goods. With his affable nature and shrewd business acumen, Tremont managed to strike several profitable deals, leaving the colony with a lighter cargo hold but a heavier wallet.

Satisfied with his success, Tremont returned to his ship and set course for the next planet on his itinerary. As he traveled through space, he couldn't help but marvel at the vastness of the universe and the possibilities that awaited him with each new destination. It was in these moments of solitude that he found peace and purpose.

However, as Tremont approached his next destination, a hiccup in his plan threw him off balance. Three strangers appeared on his ship, armed and demanding his cargo. They were ruthless and clearly desperate. Tremont knew he couldn't let them take everything; his livelihood depended on it.

A tense standoff ensued, adrenaline coursing through Tremont's veins. He tried to negotiate, to reason with the intruders, but their desperation made them unyielding. It quickly became clear that this would not end peacefully.

In a daring move, Tremont activated the ship's emergency maneuvers, causing the ship to jolt violently. As the intruders stumbled, Tremont wrestled with them, using his knowledge of the ship's layout to gain an advantage.

Although outnumbered, Tremont's determination and resourcefulness proved invaluable. He managed to subdue the intruders, binding them with makeshift restraints. With the threat neutralized, Tremont took a moment to catch his breath and assess the situation.

Realizing that the altercation had cost him valuable time, Tremont knew he had to act quickly. He contacted the authorities on his destination planet, explaining what had transpired and requesting assistance. They assured him that help was on the way and advised him to keep the intruders restrained until their arrival.

As he waited for help to arrive, Tremont felt a mix of relief and frustration. He couldn't help but question the risks and uncertainties of his chosen profession. But deep down, he knew that the thrill of exploration and the allure of interstellar commerce were worth it.

In the end, Tremont's resilience and determination prevailed. He continued his journey, undeterred by the unexpected altercation. With each new planet, he carried with him the lessons learned and the resolve to overcome any obstacle that came his way. For Tremont, space travel and interstellar commerce were not just a means of survival, they were his passion, his raison d'être in a vast and ever-expanding universe.",1,0.0
"Title: The Translation and Publication of Norwegian Folktales: A Defender's Perspective

Introduction

As the translator responsible for bringing Norwegian folktales to a wider audience through translation and publication, I feel compelled to address the criticisms and concerns raised by those who question the value and appropriateness of such an endeavor. While I understand that this is a complex and nuanced subject, I firmly believe in the importance of preserving and sharing these precious tales with the world. In this article, I will defend my choices, explain the value of the tales, and provide a cautionary note about two specific stories that are not suitable for children. It is my hope that this discussion will shed light on the delicate process of translation and the significance of these timeless stories.

Faithfulness and Truth in Translation

Translation is a delicate craft, one that requires an unwavering commitment to faithfulness and truth. As a translator, my foremost objective was to capture the essence and spirit of the original Norwegian folktales while making them accessible to a broader audience. I aimed to preserve the cultural nuances and linguistic richness, rendering the tales in a manner that would resonate with readers from different backgrounds. It is neither possible nor desirable to achieve a literal word-for-word translation, as this would ignore the cultural context and fail to convey the intended meaning.

Addressing Concerns

Critics argue that these folktales may contain elements that are unsuitable for modern sensibilities or inappropriate for children. While it is true that some tales do contain darker elements, it is essential to approach them with sensitivity and understanding. I want to acknowledge that caution must be exercised when selecting tales for young readers. In this regard, I have taken great care to provide a warning about two specific stories that contain graphic and disturbing imagery. It is my sincere hope that parents and educators will exercise discretion in sharing these tales with children, ensuring that they are age-appropriate.

Value and Significance of Norwegian Folktales

The Norwegian folktales hold immense value and significance, serving as windows into the rich cultural heritage of the Norwegian people. These tales offer profound insights into their beliefs, traditions, and way of life. By translating and publishing these stories, I aim to preserve and transmit this cultural legacy to future generations. Additionally, these folktales depict universal themes and timeless lessons that transcend cultural boundaries. They explore the human condition, the struggle between good and evil, and the triumph of the human spirit. Through these stories, readers can embark on a journey of self-discovery and gain a deeper understanding of our shared humanity.

A Merciful and Tender Reading

I implore readers to approach this collection of Norwegian folktales with a spirit of mercy and tenderness. These stories reflect the hopes, fears, joys, and sorrows of a people, and they deserve to be treated with respect and empathy. I invite readers to engage with the tales in their entirety, allowing themselves to be transported to a world filled with mythical creatures, magical landscapes, and unforgettable characters. May you find solace, inspiration, and wisdom within these pages, forging a connection with a culture that has endured the test of time.

Conclusion

In summary, the translation and publication of Norwegian folktales is a labor of love and a commitment to preserving cultural heritage. As the translator, I have endeavored to faithfully render these stories while making them accessible to a wider audience. While acknowledging the concerns regarding appropriateness, I have taken steps to provide warnings where necessary. I firmly believe in the value and significance of these tales, and I hope that readers will approach them with an open heart and a willingness to explore the depths of Norwegian culture and the universal truths these stories encapsulate.

"So I have tried to write an update in 3 different towns over the past 3 days, and have been very unsuccessful. Computers here are pretty ghetto, especially after being in Japan. Its getting very annoying... The trip from Langmusi back to Chengdu took a day longer than Chengdu to Langmusi...I finally saw why so many people say travelling around these parts can be really difficult. Busses are unreliable, and the roads are terrible. But, as they say in japan, shyou ga nai! (it cant be helped). My journey started in Langmusi at around 6am. I was supposed to catch a bus to the next ""town"" (actually, it was just a fork in the road, with 2 restaraunts, a ""hotel"", and a small shop. After waiting for about 2.5 hrs and watching a few sheep and yak heards make their way down the street, I came to the conclusion my bus wasnt comming. The helpful lady at the hotel assured me that the bus to Zoige at the next town would wait for me, and I should just get on a taxi. Of course, there were no taxi drivers...she said they were all asleep now. Wonderful! Finally, an hour later, we (there was a german couple in the same sitaation) got a ride to the ""town""...and you guessed it, there was no bus waiting for us. On top of that, 10 minutes later, the bus I wanted to take to that fork in the road shows up, dropping off another traveller that would turn out t obe my companion for the next few days...Kato-san from japan. To our luck, there was a young chinese couple from chengdu that spoke excellent english. They told us the next bus was going to come around 1pm. Instead of just hanging around ,they invited us to check out this local horse race in the village down the road a few minutes. Kato-san and I went, while the germans (an older couple) stayed behind. This horse race was honestly very uneventful and not to exciting. It was, however, really cool just hanging around all the local townspeople, watching and listeniging. The race itself had multiple heats of 5 riders...none of the races were close...but the winner got 5 bushells of Horse Tea (or something to that effect). Sweet! Before the race people slowly gathered in the field...the men in their oversized tibetan jackets on their Honda motercycles, the children in their school jumpers with snot running down their noses and icecream popsicles in hand, and the women in their colorful ethnic dresses. As soon as I pulled out my camera, the little kids went nuts! They could not get enough of it...being in pictures or taking them...and when they say my digital camera they were truly astonished. The instant feedback really got them going. Even the women would get into it, but generally were much shier than the kids. I laughed and played with them as the kids went from pose to pose...very fun. After a few hours of that we decided to head back to make our 1pm bus...we got there just as the bus arrived. Great! All we had to do was grab our bags from the hotel we left them in and we were on our way. No problem. Except, the young female monk who ran the place was at the horse race festival with the keys...and we were stuck...again. Shyou ga nai! Next bus, around 4pm. Now we decided to chill at the fork in the road and get some eats. Lke I said in my last post, this area is Truly Tibet...and all the local fare is tibetan. We started out our lunch with Suyou-cha, Tibetan Yak-butter Tea. This a drink that Tibetanas have all the time...gives them energy supposedly. It is made from (you guessed it...) yak butter, horse tea, and some rice-based flour-esque stuff. It is sweet, and has a strong buttery taste...Ill pass...The other stuff we tried was Zamba...a playdoey substance made from the same ingredients as the tea...it tastes like a mixture of soil, playdoe, and yup, yak butter...Kato-san and I looked at eachother and decided the best thing to do was to dig into the 40cent beers and plain old noodles...much better. After lunch Kato-san started strumming on his guitar, attracting the attention of the whole fork-in-the-road. It was really cool seing the tibetans get down to some Japanese music. Music truly transcends all cultural boundries...I wish I could play the harmonica or something... At around 5pm the bus to Zoige finally showed up...it was the dirtiest smelliest bus I have been on yet. The guy sitting behind me was spitting out his lungs for the entire ride too (on the floor of course...)...I am sure I caught some type of cold on that bus. Curses! We got to zoige at night...found a cheap hotel, and had some grub. The locals got a kick out of us sweating and coughing as we tried to down their local spicy cuisine...ha ha ha...After spending the night we planned to catch a direct bus to Chengdu...so we got up an hour before the bus departure time (6:30) thinking we could get our tickets no problem. Nope! Sold out literally 1 minute before I got to the ticket window. Wonderful! Our other option was to go back through Songpan. Time is so valuable when you travel that it really sucks having to back-track a few days...but, shyou ga nai! So we got on the bus and made the journey back. At songpan we were lucky to get a connecting bus to the small town of Maowen, set deep in the mountains along that fast moving river. Maowen is not even an afterthought in all the Chjina travel books, but it was quite nice staying there. I think it is home to the Qiang minority group, but I really am not sure. They looked and dressed completely different than the Tibetans. Their dress was almost persian-like. They had big head",0,0.0
"a relic of pre-expansion days. Within the remnants of the ship was found a small box of metal covered with several thicknesses of tar and wax impregnated fabric which had been mostly destroyed. The metal itself was badly oxidized, but served to protect an inner wooden box that contained a number of thin sheets of a fragile substance composed mainly of cellulose which were brown and crumbling with age. The sheets were covered with runes of _lingua antiqua_ arranged in regular rows, inscribed by hand with a carbon-based ink which has persisted remarkably well despite the degenerative processes of time. Although much of the manuscript is illegible, sufficient remains to settle for all time the Dannar-Marraket Controversy and lend important corroborating evidence to the Cassaheb Thesis of Terrestrial migrations. The genuineness of this fragment has been established beyond doubt. Radiocarbon dating places its age at ten thousand plus or minus one hundred cycles, which would place it at the very beginning of the Intellectual Emergence. Its importance is beyond question. Its implications are shocking despite the fact that they conform to many of the early legends and form a solid foundation for Dannar's Thesis which has heretofore been regarded as implausible. In the light of this material, the whole question of racial origins may well have to be reevaluated. Without further comment, the translated text is presented herewith.

It is, I suppose, a form of egotism--for I do not expect that it shall ever be read in the event that I am unable to leave this place. Yet it affords me a certain satisfaction to think that a part of me will remain long after I have returned to dust. In any event, I feel that one is not truly dead if a part of his personality remains. Many of the ancients such as Homer, Phidias, Confucius, Christ, da Vinci, Lincoln, Einstein, Churchill--and many others--live on through their works when otherwise they would long since have been forgotten and thus be truly dead. Earth's history is full of such examples. And while I have no expectation of an immortality such as theirs, it flatters my ego to think that there will be some part of me which also will survive ... _(Note: There are several lines following this which are obliterated, defaced or unreadable. There are more to follow. In the future such gaps in the content will be indicated thus: ...)_ ... I expect that it is a basic trait of character, for spacemen must be gregarious, and although I am not truly a spaceman I have been in space and, in consequence, my character is no different from my ex-crewmates--at least in that respect. I think as time passes I shall miss the comfort of companionship, the sense of belonging to a group, the card games, the bull sessions, the endless speculation on what comes next, or what we will do when the voyage is over and we are again on Earth ... ... I particularly recall Gregory. Odd, but I never knew his surname, or maybe it was his given name, for Gregory could function as well in one respect as the other. He would boast continually of what he would do to wine, women, and song once we returned to Earth. Poor Gregory. The meteor that hulled our ship struck squarely through the engine room where he was on duty. Probably he never knew that he had died. At least his fate had the mercy of being brief. Certainly it is not like mine. It was ... given ... There was plenty of time for the survivors to reach the lifeboats, and in our decimated condition there were plenty of boats--which increased our chances of living by a factor of four ... I suppose that it was foolish to give way to the feeling of every man for himself but I am not a spaceman trained to react automatically to emergencies. Neither am I a navigator or a pilot, although I can fly in an emergency. I am a biologist, a specialist member of the scientific staff--essentially an individualist. I knew enough to seal myself in, push the eject button and energize the drive. However, I did not know that a lifeboat had no acceleration compensators, and by the time the drive lever returned to neutral, I was far out in space and thoroughly lost. I could detect no lifeboats in the vicinity nor could I raise any on the radio. I later found that a transistor malfunctioned, but by then I was well out of range, stranded between the stars in the black emptiness of space. After reading the manual on lifeboat operation there was but one course open. I selected the nearest G-type star, set the controls on automatic, and went into cold sleep. There was nothing else to do. If I remained awake I would be dead of oxygen starvation long before I reached a habitable world. The only alternative was the half-death of frozen sleep and the long wait until the boat came within range of the sun I had selected. * * * * * I awoke in orbit around this world, and after I recovered full use of my faculties and checked the analyzer, I decided to land. I'm afraid I did a rather bad job of it, since I used the chemical rockets too late, and the plasma jets scorched a considerable amount of acreage in the meadow where I finally came to rest. However, the residual radioactivity is low, and it is safe enough to walk outside.... The life boat is lying beside a small stream which empties into a circular pool of blue water in the center of a small meadow. The fiery trail of the jets and rockets has burned a hundred-foot-wide",0,0.0
"So, last week I had the amazing opportunity to watch the new Harry Potter movie in a German theater and let me tell you, it was quite an experience! I've always been a huge fan of the Harry Potter series, so getting to see the latest installment on the big screen was a dream come true.

First of all, let me just say that the theater itself was fantastic. The chairs were so comfortable, it was like sitting on a cloud. They were these plush, reclining chairs that you could sink into and relax. Not to mention, they had plenty of legroom, which is always a plus in my book. I've been to some theaters in the past where I felt like I was squished in like a sardine, so this was a pleasant surprise.

The screen was also massive, which only added to the immersive experience. It felt like I was being transported into the wizarding world myself. The sound quality was top-notch too, every spell and magical creature came to life through the speakers. It really made me appreciate the effort that goes into creating a movie of this scale.

Now, let's talk about the most important part of any movie-going experience - the snacks. The theater had a wide variety of popcorn flavors to choose from. From classic butter to sweet caramel and even savory cheese, they had it all. I couldn't resist getting a large tub of the caramel popcorn, it was the perfect mix of sweet and crunchy. And of course, I had to wash it down with a large soda. It's all about that perfect balance of salty and sweet, you know?

One interesting thing about watching a movie in a German theater is the ""pause"" in the middle. Yes, you heard that right. They actually pause the movie halfway through so that everyone can take a break. At first, I found this a bit strange, as I'm used to watching movies straight through without any interruptions. But I quickly realized that it was actually quite convenient. It gave me a chance to stretch my legs, use the restroom, and grab some more popcorn before settling back in for the second half of the movie.

Another thing that I loved about the theater experience in Germany was the ability to buy tickets ahead of time. No more waiting in long lines or worrying about the movie being sold out. I simply went online, selected my seat, and purchased my ticket. It was so convenient and made the whole process much smoother.

Now, aside from watching the Harry Potter movie, I had a pretty eventful week overall. I happen to catch a cold, which wasn't the most pleasant experience, but I powered through it. I also attended a birth preparation class, as I'm expecting a baby soon. It was really informative and helped ease some of my anxiety about the upcoming birth.

On top of that, I joined a water gymnastics class. It's a fun way to stay active during pregnancy, and the water provides a soothing effect on my body. It's a great way to relieve any pregnancy-related discomfort and keep fit at the same time.

Oh, and did I mention that I also had the task of picking music for a wedding reception? It's a close friend's wedding, and she asked me to help create a playlist. It's a big responsibility because you want to make sure the music is enjoyable for all ages and keeps the party going. So, I spent hours going through different genres, old and new songs, trying to find the perfect mix. It was a bit overwhelming, but also a lot of fun.

All in all, it was a week filled with excitement and new experiences. From watching the new Harry Potter movie in a cozy German theater to attending prenatal classes and curating the perfect wedding playlist, it was a whirlwind of activities. And even though I had a cold lingering in the background, it didn't stop me from enjoying every moment.",1,0.0
"It was a chilly autumn evening in a small, rural village in Japan. The leaves on the trees had started changing colors, painting the landscape with vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow. The villagers whispered in hushed tones about the haunted waterfall that lay deep within the forest. Legend had it that the spirits of disgruntled souls lurked there, waiting to prey on the weak-hearted.

One such legend that had been passed down from generation to generation was the tale of O-Katsu, a brave and fearless woman who dared to venture into the depths of the haunted waterfall. The story sent shivers down my spine as I sat huddled around the warmth of a crackling fire, listening intently to the elderly storyteller.

O-Katsu was known for her unwavering courage and determination. Her friends and family often marveled at her fearlessness and admired her spirit. However, there were those who doubted her bravery and believed she was merely putting on a facade for attention. Determined to prove them wrong, O-Katsu made up her mind to face the haunted waterfall head-on.

The following morning, clad in a simple, yet sturdy kimono, O-Katsu set off on her treacherous journey. The villagers lined the streets, watching in awe as she disappeared into the thick mist that hung over the forest. Parents held their children close, fearful for O-Katsu's safety. They had heard tales of people who braved the haunted waterfall never to return.

As O-Katsu trudged deeper into the forest, the atmosphere became increasingly eerie. The sounds of rustling leaves and distant howls of the wind filled the air. But O-Katsu remained undeterred. She had come too far to turn back now. With each step, her determination grew stronger, her heart beating with a mix of excitement and trepidation.

After what felt like an eternity, O-Katsu finally reached the entrance of the waterfall. The sound of rushing water echoed through the forest, blending with the whispers of the spirits that supposedly resided there. She took a deep breath and steeled herself for what lay ahead.

As she approached the edge, the mist cleared, revealing a breathtaking sight. The waterfall cascaded down, its crystal-clear water shimmering under the dappled sunlight that filtered through the trees. The beauty of the scene momentarily took O-Katsu's breath away, but she quickly reminded herself of the true purpose of her journey.

Summoning all her courage, O-Katsu took a step forward, determined to venture behind the waterfall. She had heard tales of a hidden path leading to a secret realm that only the bravest souls could access. The villagers spoke of its ethereal beauty and the enchanting melodies that resonated throughout.

As O-Katsu ventured deeper into the darkness behind the waterfall, she could feel an otherworldly presence enveloping her. Whispers filled her ears, and shadows danced at the periphery of her vision. Yet, she pressed on, defying the fear that threatened to consume her.

After what felt like an eternity, O-Katsu emerged into a breathtakingly beautiful world. Lush greenery surrounded her, and flowers of every color bloomed in abundance. The air was fragrant with the scent of cherry blossoms and the sweet melody of singing birds filled her ears.

Overcome with awe, O-Katsu wandered through this mystical realm. Every step she took revealed a new wonder, a new secret waiting to be discovered. Time seemed to lose all meaning as she lost herself in the magical beauty of her surroundings.

But just as quickly as the enchantment had embraced her, it began to fade away. O-Katsu could faintly hear the calls of the villagers in the distance, urging her to return. Reluctantly, she turned back, retracing her steps through the haunted waterfall.

As the mist cleared, O-Katsu emerged from the forest, greeted by the relieved faces of her loved ones. They gathered around her, astounded and in awe of her bravery. O-Katsu had proven that she was more than just a facade; she was a woman of true courage and indomitable spirit.

From that day forward, O-Katsu became a legend in her own right. Her name was whispered in hushed tones, and her story was retold time and time again, inspiring future generations to face their fears head-on.

As I finished recounting the story, the fire crackled, sending sparks dancing into the night sky. The listeners sat in silence, their eyes wide with wonder and admiration for O-Katsu's bravery. It was a tale that reminded us all of the power of determination and the beauty that lay beyond our fears.",1,0.0
"Subject: A Weekend in the Life of a Homeless Person

Dear Friend,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to share with you an impactful experience that my friend John recently went through. He made the brave decision to spend a weekend living as a homeless person, immersing himself in a world that most of us would rather ignore. His eye-opening journey has left me with a heavy heart and a renewed sense of compassion for those less fortunate than myself.

John's first night on the streets was a rude awakening. He found himself searching for a safe place to sleep, constantly vigilant of his surroundings. As he settled into an abandoned alleyway, he couldn't help but feel a sense of vulnerability and fear that he had never experienced before. The constant noise of the city, the cold concrete beneath him, and the desperate cries of his fellow homeless neighbors created a tumultuous atmosphere that he struggled to comprehend.

During his time on the streets, John encountered a wide range of people, both homeless and not. One particular encounter that struck a chord with him was a young woman who seemed no older than twenty. She shared her story of escaping an abusive home, only to find herself caught in the cycle of homelessness. She had dreams and aspirations, but her circumstances seemed to have stolen them away. John came to realize that homelessness could happen to anyone, regardless of age, race, or social status.

Begging became a necessary means for survival during John's experience. He discovered that individuals often passed him by without even acknowledging his presence. The feeling of being invisible and forgotten weighed heavily on him. Those who did stop to offer assistance often offered judgment rather than genuine help. It was disheartening to witness how quickly society dehumanizes those living on the streets, failing to recognize that behind every homeless person is a story and a human being deserving of compassion.

Throughout his time living on the streets, John found solace in the camaraderie among his fellow homeless individuals. Despite their challenging circumstances, they formed a tight-knit community, looking out for one another and offering support when it was most needed. They shared meals, stories, and moments of laughter, reminding John that amidst the despair, there is still hope and humanity.

John also observed the harsh realities of homelessness that many of us often overlook. The lack of access to basic hygiene facilities made him acutely aware of the dehumanizing nature of living on the streets. He saw firsthand the toll it took on individuals' physical and mental well-being. The blatant disregard for their welfare by society at large was a bitter pill to swallow.

In reflecting on his experience, John has come to realize the importance of prevention when it comes to homelessness, particularly among young people. The young woman he met highlighted the need for early intervention and support systems that can help break the cycle. He believes that by addressing the root causes of homelessness, such as family conflicts, mental health issues, and substance abuse, we can prevent more individuals from falling through the cracks.

This experience has profoundly impacted John, and his willingness to share his story has deeply moved me. It serves as a reminder that the struggles of homelessness extend far beyond the stereotypes we often buy into. There is a real, human face behind each homeless person, and it is our duty to advocate for compassion, understanding, and sustainable solutions.

I hope this email leaves you as reflective as it has left me. It's easy to look away and ignore the issue of homelessness, but we must remember that our shared humanity binds us all together. Let us strive to be the change we want to see by supporting organizations that provide shelter, rehabilitation, and the necessary resources to help individuals rebuild their lives.

With compassion and hope,

"The Four Branches of the Mabinogi or Pedair Cainc Y Mabinogi are the earliest prose stories in the literature of Britain. Originally written in Wales in Middle Welsh, but widely available in translations, the Mabinogi is generally agreed to be a single work in four parts, or ""branches."" The interrelated tales can be read as mythology, political themes, romances, or magical fantasies. They appeal to a wide range of readers, from young children to the most sophisticated adult. The tales are popular today in book format, as storytelling or theatre performances; they appear in recordings and on film, and continue to inspire many reinterpretations in artwork and modern fiction. The Mabinogi are known as the Four Branches of the Mabinogi, or Pedair Cainc y Mabinogi in Welsh. The tales were compiled from oral tradition in the 11th century. They survived in private family libraries via medieval manuscripts, of which two main versions and some fragments continue to survive today. Early modern scholarship of the Mabinogi saw the tales as a garbled Welsh mythology which prompted attempts to salvage or reconstruct them. Since the 1970s the tales have become recognised as a complex secular literature, though rooted in and containing elements of Welsh Mythology, with powerfully explored characters, political, ethical and gendered themes, as well as imaginative fantasies. The style of writing is admired for its deceptive simplicity and controlled wordpower, as well as intricate doublets where mirrorings have been compared to Celtic knotwork.[1] The world displayed within the Mabinogi extends across Wales, to Ireland, and into England. It presents a legendary Britain as a united land under a king, yet with powerful separate princedoms, where native Welsh law, hud (magic), and romance, combine in a unique synergy. Possible authors who have been proposed for the Four Branches include Rhigyfarch and Gwenllian ferch Gruffydd.[2] Each Branch contains several tale episodes in a sequence, and each Branch is titled with the name of a leading protagonist. These titles are Pwyll, Branwen, Manawydan and Math, but this is a modern custom; the Branches are not titled in the mediaeval manuscripts. Only one character appears in all four Branches, Pryderi, though he is never dominant or central to any of the Branches. Pwyll Pendefeg Dyfed, ""Pwyll Prince of Dyfed"", hunting on his own land, meets the shining Cŵn Annwn or ""Hounds of Annwfn"", and takes another man's kill, a stag, for himself. Arawn, the king of Annwfn, is greatly offended. As recompense, Pwyll switches bodies with Arawn and dwells in Annwfn to vanquish Arawn's adversary. Pwyll chastely shares the queen's bed for a year. Pwyll defeats Arawn's enemy Hafgan, and is then rewarded with an alliance between his land of Dyfed, and Annwfn. Pwyll then returns home to Dyfed where he finds it has been well ruled by Arawn in the past year. Next, Pwyll encounters Rhiannon, a beautiful and powerful maiden on a shining magical horse. They are strangely unreachable by anyone, for as they attempt to approach, Rhiannon and her horse get further away. Finally, they ask her to stop in which she complies and it is revealed that Rhiannon has chosen Pwyll as her husband, which he welcomes. On Rhiannon and Pwyll's wedding day in the court of Hyfaidd Hen, Gwawl appears in disguise and tricks Pwyll into giving him the entire wedding feast and Rhiannon. Rhiannon then guides Pwyll through a cunning strategy using her magic bag which can never be filled, to extricate her from her betrothal to the princely Gwawl. Gwawl is trapped in the bag and beaten by Pwyll's men until he agrees to Rhiannon's terms, including foregoing vengeance. Rhiannon eventually bears Pwyll a son and heir, but the child disappears the night he is born. Rhiannon's maids, in fear of their lives, accuse her of killing and eating her own baby. Rhiannon negotiates a penalty where she must sit at the castle gate every day for seven years telling her terrible tale to strangers and offer them a ride on her back. Meanwhile, the child is rescued from its monstrous abductor by Teyrnon Twrf Lliant. He and his wife adopt the boy who grows heroically apace, and adores horses. They called him Gwri Wallt Efryn (Gwri 'Golden Hair', Welsh: Gwallt Euraid). Teyrnon sees the boy's resemblance to Pwyll, so he restores the boy to Dyfed for a happy ending. Rhiannon is vindicated as is Pwyll's loyalty to her. Their son is renamed Pryderi ""Loss"", as is custom from his mother's first words to him: Pryderi puns on anxiety and labour. In due course, Pryderi inherits the rule of Dyfed. In the second branch, Branwen, sister of Brân the Blessed, king of Britain, is requested by and given in marriage to Matholwch, king of Ireland. Brân's half-brother Efnysien, angered that no one consulted him, insults Matholwch by mutilating all his valuable horses so horribly they become useless. Brân the Blessed gives Matholwch compensation in the form of new horses and treasure, then added a magical cauldron (Welsh: Pair Dadeni) which can restore the dead to life, although the revived persons will always remain unable to speak. The legend of this cauldron, when the two kings compare its lore, is that it came from Ireland. In Ireland, Matholwch and Branwen have a son, Gwern. The Irish nobles continue to be hostile because of what Efnysien did. Matholwch allows them to sway him, and casts Branwen away to serf in the kitchens, struck on the face every day by a low-caste butcher. Branwen trains a starling to take a message to Brân across the Irish Sea. He musters his host and crosses the sea to war on Matholwch. Brân is so huge he wades across with his ships beside him. Branwen persuades the Irish to sue for peace by building a colossal building to house Brân, which he has never had before. The Irish hide two hundred warriors in the house, hanging in bags on its pillars. Efnysien shrewdly suspects treachery and disbelieves the Irish story these are bags",0,0.0
"Title: My Christmas Vacation: A Writing Adventure and Biased Baking

Introduction:
Hey there, fellow adventurers! So, gather around the fireplace (or cozy up on the couch with a warm cup of cocoa) as I regale you with tales of my recent Christmas vacation. Get ready for a festive mix of family shenanigans, present mania, and an unexpected writing adventure that took me on a whimsical journey through the streets of my town. So, without further ado, let's dive into the frothy sea of holiday cheer!

Christmas Dinner:
Ah, Christmas dinner, the moment when our family attempts to put the ""fun"" in dysfunctional. Picture this: my uncle, who still believes he's a stand-up comedian in training, cracking jokes that are as stale as last year's fruitcake. And let's not forget my grandmother, who seems determined to make it a competition of who can consume the most mashed potatoes, with a side of passive-aggressive comments. Nevertheless, I love these crazy folks, and I wouldn't trade our festive chaos for anything else in the world.

Gift-Giving:
Now, onto the highlight of every Christmas: the gift-giving extravaganza. As a self-proclaimed expert in unwrapping presents, let me break down the categories for you. Firstly, there are the well-intentioned but completely missed-the-mark gifts. Cue the oversized sweater that doubles as a sleeping bag, or the DIY pottery set that reminds you of your preschool days (with equally questionable artistic skills). Bless their hearts, Aunt Mildred and Cousin Tim, for their enthusiastic but slightly misguided efforts.

Then come the practical presents—the socks, the gift cards, and the world's fanciest butter dish. Hey, who doesn't need a butter dish worthy of a royal banquet? But my absolute favorite category is the unexpected joy-bringers. You know, those gifts that make you squeal with glee and jump up and down like a kid on a sugar rush. This year, I scored a writing desk that's as cozy as a fleece blanket and a brand-new set of colorful gel pens. Time to embark on some inky adventures!

Writing Adventure at a Pastry Shop:
Now, let me set the scene for my most stunning adventure. It all began on a chilly winter morning when the tantalizing aroma of fresh pastries wafted through the air, drawing me like a moth to a flame. My plan was simple: indulge in sugary delights, sip on a decadent latte, and lose track of time with my trusty notebook and pen. Little did I know that this pastry shop would serve as the backdrop to a page-turning adventure.

As I settled into a cozy corner, the words began to flow effortlessly. Ideas bounced around in my head like popcorn kernels in a microwave. The clattering of coffee cups mixed with the gentle hum of conversations became my symphony, inspiring me to unleash my creativity in a flurry of words. I wrote about gingerbread men coming to life, waltzing in the moonlight, and chocolate cakes that whispered secret recipes into my ear. It was as if the pastries themselves were my muse, lending a touch of magic to my writing sanctuary.

Plans for Lunch:
Now, while my writing adventure was going swimmingly, my growling stomach reminded me that lunchtime had long since arrived. Inspired by the scrumptious bounty surrounding me, I decided to venture outside my comfort zone and try something new. With an air of culinary bravery, I settled on a tiny street food stall that claimed to serve the most outrageous deep-fried delicacies. I mean, who can resist the temptation of deep-fried pickles and Oreos? Not me, that's for sure.

Deciding to Extend My Vacation:
As my Christmas vacation drew to a close, a nagging feeling tugged at my heartstrings—I wasn't ready to bid farewell to the holiday cheer just yet. So, I made a pact with myself, amid mouthfuls of deep-fried pickles, to extend my vacation. I resolved to indulge in lazy mornings, uninterrupted writing sessions, and mid-afternoon naps that would make even the laziest cat envious. Because sometimes, you just need to hit the pause button on adulting and embrace the joy that comes with treating yourself.

Conclusion:
And there you have it, folks! My Christmas vacation filled with family chaos, hilarious gifts, and a delightful writing adventure amidst the delectable world of pastries. I hope my little escapades brought a smile to your face or, at the very least, sparked a craving for some deep-fried goodies. Remember, life is meant to be savored, one bite-sized adventure at a time. So, go forth, dear friends, and may your days be filled with warmth, laughter, and a little bit of whimsy. Cheers to an unforgettable Christmas vacation!",1,0.0
"In the peaceful village of Saint-Pierre, nestled in the heart of the countryside, lived a dedicated and diligent mailman named François. Every day, he embarked on his trusty bicycle, loaded with letters, packages, and the dreams of the villagers. The joy of delivering mail to the friendly faces of Saint-Pierre became the highlight of his routine.

As the sun slowly rose over the picturesque landscape, François began his route. The vibrant colors of the wildflowers danced in the gentle breeze, while the melodious songs of the birds filled the air. He pedaled from one charming house to the next, greeting each person with a warm smile and a cheery ""Bonjour!""

One morning, as François opened a creaky mailbox, he noticed something unusual. There, amidst the letters, lay a folded newspaper article. Curiosity got the better of him, and he quickly glanced at the headline. His eyes widened as he read the chilling details of a gruesome murder that had taken place nearby. The article sent shivers down his spine, stirring a sense of unease within him.

Determined to shake off the unsettling thoughts, François continued his rounds, delivering mail to the villagers. The post office was his window to the world, and he cherished the connections he had cultivated over the years. From the old baker who always had a warm loaf of bread waiting for him, to the young couple eagerly awaiting news about their overseas adventures, François felt like the bearer of happiness.

However, fate had a different plan in store for François that fateful day. As he approached the imposing house of the local tax collector, Monsieur Dupont, he noticed an eerie silence enveloping the usually lively property. The windows were tightly shut, and not a single sound escaped its walls. Unease washed over François once again, and he felt a tingling sense of foreboding.

As he approached the gate, a chilling sound pierced the silence. It sounded like muffled cries for help or the scraping of furniture being moved. Paralyzed with fear, François hesitated for a split second before summoning his courage and springing into action. Without a second thought, he raced back to his bicycle and pedaled furiously towards the police station.

Upon arriving breathlessly at the station, François stumbled over his words, recounting the newspaper article and the unsettling sounds he had heard at Monsieur Dupont's house. The police officers, initially skeptical, were swayed by François' sincerity and dispatched a team to investigate.

Hours passed, and as François anxiously waited for news, he couldn't help but feel a gnawing sense of doubt. Had he overreacted? Was it all a figment of his imagination? Doubt turned to relief when the police officers returned with stern expressions on their faces.

They confirmed François' suspicions— Mme Dupont had been held captive by an intruder. Thanks to his swift response, the officers arrived just in time to apprehend the criminal and ensure the safety of Mme Dupont. François had inadvertently become a hero, his keen observation and quick thinking saving a life.

The village of Saint-Pierre celebrated François' bravery, honoring him as the mailman who had not only delivered letters but had also delivered justice. From that day forward, François continued his daily routine, delivering mail with a renewed sense of purpose and pride.

As he pedaled through the quaint village, the countryside seemed even more vibrant, the songs of the birds even sweeter. François realized that sometimes, even in the most tranquil places, darkness can lurk. But he also learned that in the face of adversity, even the simplest actions can make a difference. And so, armed with compassion and dedication, François continued to be the heart and soul of Saint-Pierre, delivering not just letters, but also hope.",1,0.0
"In the heart of the dystopian society, a group of government officials gathered in a dimly lit room, discussing their sinister plan. The community they sought to eliminate was called York, a group of individuals who refused to conform to the government's ideals. Their independent thinking and resistance irked the authorities, and now they were determined to wipe out any remaining trace of dissent.

""We must ensure that York is eradicated,"" declared Minister Sinclair, his voice cold and calculating. ""They pose a threat to our carefully constructed utopia. Their refusal to conform undermines our authority and destabilizes the harmony we have worked so hard to achieve.""

The other officials nodded in agreement, their faces void of empathy or compassion. Their loyalty to the oppressive government was unwavering, their hearts consumed by power and control. They discussed various methods to eliminate York, from forced displacement to total annihilation. To them, the end justified any means necessary.

Meanwhile, in the outskirts of York, a resident named Emily contemplated her limited options for entertainment. The government restricted access to the outside world, controlling what the community could read, watch, or listen to. Books were censored, only allowing propaganda and approved literature. Television programs were limited to mind-numbing reality shows that perpetuated conformity and obedience.

Emily had grown tired of this monotonous existence. She longed for intellectual stimulation, for the freedom to explore her own thoughts and ideas. But in this oppressive society, such desires were viewed as dangerous and punishable. She knew the risks involved, yet her spirit remained resilient.

As Emily wandered through the desolate streets of York, she encountered a confrontation with the authorities. A group of government enforcers, clothed in black uniforms and armed with batons, stopped her in her tracks.

""State your business,"" one of the enforcers demanded, his voice dripping with authority.

""I'm just going for a walk,"" Emily replied, attempting to mask her fear and frustration.

""You know better than to wander alone without permission,"" another enforcer sneered, his eyes gleaming with a sinister delight. ""We can't have disobedience in our society.""

Emily felt helplessness consume her. The authorities had all the power, and her resistance seemed futile. But deep down, a spark of defiance ignited within her. She was determined to fight for her community, fight for their right to exist.

Back in the government office, the officials finalized their plans to eliminate York. Minister Sinclair proposed a strategy of disinformation and staged provocations to justify their extermination. They would create a narrative that portrayed the residents of York as violent extremists, threatening the peace and harmony of the society they had built.

Little did they know, Emily was ready to challenge their narrative. She had witnessed the true essence of her community during her time in York – a group of diverse and compassionate individuals who refused to bow down to oppression. They were artists, thinkers, dreamers, and fighters.

Emily knew that the fight ahead of her would be arduous. The authorities held the power, the resources, and the means to crush any form of resistance. But she also knew that the human spirit was indomitable. It would take more than fear and intimidation to extinguish the light of freedom.

As the government finalized their plans, Emily gathered the remaining members of York, urging them to stand together in the face of annihilation. She spoke of hope, of the power of unity, and the importance of fighting for what they believed in.

In this dystopian society, where oppression reigned supreme, the battle for survival had just begun. The officials may have underestimated the resilience and determination of a community like York, but they were about to witness the strength of human spirit and the unstoppable desire for freedom.",1,0.0
"Alaigal Oivathillai (Waves never cease) is a 1981 Indian-Tamil language coming of age Romantic film directed by Bharathiraja. The film tells the story of Vichu, a Hindu boy, and Mary, a Christian girl, and their journey to unite against social and religious barriers.

The movie follows the lives of Vichu and Mary, two individuals from different backgrounds who find love amidst the turbulent social climate of the 1980s in Tamil Nadu, India. Vichu, played by Karthik, is a talented Carnatic singer and an aspiring music director, while Mary, portrayed by Radha, is a passionate dancer. Their paths cross when Vichu witnesses Mary's graceful dance performance at a local event, and he is captivated by her beauty and talent.

However, their love faces numerous hurdles as they come from different religious backgrounds. Vichu's orthodox Hindu family vehemently opposes their relationship, as they believe that inter-religious marriages are against their cultural values. On the other hand, Mary's conservative Christian family is equally resistant to the idea of her being in a relationship with a Hindu boy.

Despite the opposition from their families, Vichu and Mary continue to meet secretly, cherishing their time together. They share their dreams, aspirations, and build a strong bond based on love and mutual understanding. The movie beautifully captures their innocent and pure love, which transcends societal norms and religious boundaries.

As the story progresses, Vichu and Mary face several challenges. They deal with familial pressures, societal judgments, and religious prejudice. However, they remain steadfast in their love for each other and are determined to overcome all obstacles to be together.

Alaigal Oivathillai not only explores the theme of inter-religious love but also delves into various social issues prevalent in society at that time, such as caste discrimination and the importance of following one's passion. The film highlights the need to break free from societal shackles and make choices based on love and individuality.

The performances of Karthik and Radha as Vichu and Mary, respectively, were widely acclaimed. They brought great chemistry and authenticity to their roles, making the audience emotionally invested in their love story. The film's music, composed by Ilaiyaraaja, became immensely popular, with songs like ""Ilamai Idho Idho"" and ""Muthumani Malai"" becoming chartbusters.

Alaigal Oivathillai received positive reviews from critics and became a blockbuster hit at the box office. The film's realistic portrayal of love and its ability to transcend societal barriers resonated with the audience. It was praised for its sensitive handling of the subject matter and the impactful performances of the lead actors.

The film's success also led to its Hindi remake, Lovers, in 1983. The remake, starring Kumar Gaurav and Padmini Kolhapure, was well-received by the Hindi-speaking audience as well.

Alaigal Oivathillai remains an iconic film in Tamil cinema, known for its powerful storytelling and memorable performances. It continues to be cherished by audiences, reminding them of the power of love and the importance of breaking societal norms in the pursuit of happiness.",1,0.0
"No rest for the wicked.... or wickeaad for those in Boston Ok absolutely zonked out around or after 12, by 4:30 I was up. I tried falling back asleep, but I got all the sleep I could I guess. Maybe I'll nap latter since the kids and co went home yesterday. While fighting my loosing battle of falling back asleep I looked back yet again and examined how I felt on how everything was last night. I hate to sound catty and judging, but I make no secret about my Catholic upbringing and they breed being both judging and catty. The People Really cool. I didn't talk to as many I would have liked to but almost everyone I did was so nice, so friendly. I only gave out one of my cards, but I was ducking someone. On that subject, I don't know if she was on drugs, I don't know what her issues was, or if that was the real her, but omg it was uncomfortable. I would suggest to anyone to not look to the fab five on how to act as a woman, they are gay men, not women. I might also suggest that real women don't have those kind of mannerism, or act like that, those qualities and gestures I saw last night were so Nathan Lane so stereotypical, so Springer. I am fighting those stereotypes from people in my old life so just stay away BITCH. I find myself wanting to say more and more without being mean, but I cannot, and I am going back and forth typing and deleting nasty little comments. I just sometimes feel so upset by some people I just unload. My little tart of a friend, who looked like Jackie O' with a nasty five o'clock shadow, though isn't worth it. Everyone else was really cool like I said, and there were trannies of all ages, shapes and sizes. Me and my homophobic background made me uneasy at first, but I got over that very quickly, these were really nice people. I couldn't believe I was ever afraid of this group by the time the end of the night came, and like I said I look forward to next years. I thought these people were so much braver than I, I pass I am told without much effort, (if only they knew the old me and how I look in the am still) so I have less at risk then they do. I am sure if they were going through the full ride like myself they would find a way to blend. Blending isn't all about looks, looks help, but confidence is key. If you act like you belong most of the time it is easy to pass. I don't get some of my transsexual group who claim they have trouble passing when all I see is a woman, but hey what do I know right, I'm the newbie. I was also glad to have an FTM from twenty in attendance it was cool he came even though we didn't talk much. I just enjoy being around other transsexuals sometimes, it reminds me I am not alone. I saw something I have only heard about but have never seen, an admirer. An admirer is a person who loves trannies, why I don't know. I saw an older distinguished man, but I was blown away when a young lady was over trying to pick up my ""friend"" Jackie O. I don't get allot of stuff that goes on in my community, but I also try not to judge. I also was impressed and depressed by the amount of SO's in attendance. It actually made it hard though to figure out who was real, who was just dressed. Atmosphere Food and entertainment was great, as was most of the music, I do have to watch Hedwigg I guess, there was some pretty interesting music off that soundtrack. I ate very well, stayed away from the seeds, and I was at a table where nothing went to waste. It was good, I feel like such a bad person for leaving good food on my plate when there are so many people without. I just can't do anything with seeds anymore, damn stress did a number on my system for all those years. I did also very much enjoy the conversation, but not the nickname I got for my wind blown look. A girl like me with a name like that is going to have trouble meeting nice young ladies. I look forward to more debate, I am getting so tired of doing all the talking all the typing, I really miss listening and just reading. It will all come in good time as I get out more and back to work. Helen and Betty Betty was good looking, Helen was different than I imagined, she was not the total babe I envisioned. I was saddened to hear she isn't a lesbian either, and I just don't have the effort in me to try and turn anyone that way, and if I could it would be co I would be changing. I didn't go and talk to them, hard to go and talk to someone face to face when you have talked about wanting to ""have some fun with them""(sorry its Sunday) in a blog, or to the wife of said person. Helen's voice still turned me on, so I sat back and enjoyed it, not to mention the talk was good, I will read her book someday, but she is more about CD. My Shyness Hey for me sometimes it is hard for me to move on and not be caught in the past. This was my first time out in a party setting of this magnitude without the misses. No oh wait, my last office Christmas party, and I got so freakin drunk at that I was sick for days on end. I don't like to drink all that much,",0,0.0
"am doesn't qualify you for that superior pose. You're only a man, you know, after all."" ""Buckskin Bill is only a man, but he's a pretty tough proposition,"" said Burton, with a frown. She smoothed the frown away with caressing fingers. ""I know. That's why I'd like to shoot him. But he's sure to be caught now, isn't he? They've got him in a trap. He'll never wriggle through with Fletcher Hill to outwit him. You said yourself that with him on the job the odds were dead against him."" ""Oh, I know. So they are. But he's such a wily devil. Well, I'd better be going."" Jack Burton arose with the deliberate movements of a heavy man. ""I'm sick of this business, Dot. If it weren't for you, I believe I'd chuck it all and go into business in a town."" ""Oh, darling! How silly!"" protested Dot. ""What a good thing I came out when I did! Things seem to be at a rather low ebb with you. But cheer up! What's a few head of cattle when all's said and done? When once this rascal is laid by the heels, you'll make up quicker than you know. Of course you will. Don't let yourself get downhearted! What is the good?"" He smiled a little. There was something heartening in the girl's slim activity of pose apart from her words. She looked indomitable. He pulled her to him and kissed her. ""Well, take care of yourself, Dot! You won't be frightened? You needn't be. He won't come your way. Hill has sworn solemnly to keep an extra guard in this direction. He may call around himself before the day is over. It wouldn't surprise me. Don't shoot him if he does! At least, give him a feed first!"" ""Oh, really, Jack!"" the girl protested. ""I shall be cross with you before long. You'd better go quick before it comes on."" She put her arms around his neck and gave him a tight hug. Her sunburnt face was pressed to his. ""Now, you won't do anything silly?"" she urged him, softly. ""I don't like parting with you in this mood. I wish I were coming too."" ""Rubbish! Rubbish!"" he said. ""You stay at home, little shepherdess, and look after the lambs! I won't be late back. Mind you are civil to Fletcher Hill if he turns up! He'll be a magistrate one of these days if he plays his cards well."" ""If he catches the biggest cattle-thief in Australia?"" suggested Dot, screwing her face into a very boyish grimace. ""I wouldn't care to get promotion for that job, if I were a man. But I'll be vastly polite to him if he turns up. You've never seen me doing the pretty, have you? But I can--awfully well--when I try."" Her brother laughed. ""Oh, don't be too pretty, my child! It's a dangerous game. Good-bye! Don't go far away!"" ""My dear man! As if I should have time!"" ejaculated Dot. She gave him another squeeze and let him go. There were a great many things to be done that day, things which a mere ignorant male would never have dreamt of. There was bread to be baked, an evening meal to be prepared, countless household duties waiting to be done, and work enough in Jack's wardrobe alone to keep an ordinary woman busy for a week. Poor Jack! He was not a great hand at needlework. She had been shocked at the state in which she had found him. But she had not shirked her responsibilities. And more than ever was she glad now that she had come to him. For he needed her in a moral sense as well. She was too much of a ""new chum"" to help him in any very active sense outside the homestead at present. But he needed a good deal of moral backing just at that moment. She had come to him straight from England, and full of enthusiasm. He had hewn his own way and begun to enjoy prosperity. But she had arrived to find that prosperity temporarily checked. A gang of cattle-thieves were making serious depredations among his stock. The police were hot on the trail, and it was believed that the gang had been split up, but so far no notable captures had been made. Buckskin Bill, the leader, was still at large, and while this remained the case there could be no security for any one. Every farmer in the district was keen on the chase, expecting to fall a victim. And--there was no doubt about it--Buckskin Bill was in a very tight corner. Inspector Hill had the matter in hand, and he was not a man to be lightly baffled. Jack regarded him with wholehearted admiration. But somehow Dot, the new arrival, felt curiously prejudiced against him. She wanted Buckskin Bill to be caught, but she could not help hoping that this astute Inspector of Police would not be his captor. She was sure from Jack's description that she would not like the man, and as she went about her work she earnestly hoped that he would not come her way, at least in her brother's absence. She was busy indoors during the whole of the morning. As midday approached the heat became intense. Jack usually returned for a meal at noon, but she was not expecting him that day. He had joined the chase, and had taken with him every available man. She might have felt lonely if she had not been so engrossed. As it was, she hummed cheerily to herself as she went to and fro. There were so many things to think about, and it was such an interesting world in which she found herself. In the early afternoon she went out to feed a few motherless lambs that her brother had placed in her charge.

"George Forbes, 3rd Earl of Granard PC (21 October 1685 – 19 June 1765)[1] was an Anglo-Irish naval commander and diplomat. He was at the Capture of Gibraltar. He took a very valuable prize ship and was briefly a Governor of the Leeward Islands. He took a role in politics, helping to end Robert Walpole's career, but eventually retired. Forbes was the son of Arthur Forbes, 2nd Earl of Granard and Mary, daughter of Sir George Rawdon, 1st Baronet, of Moira, County Down, was born in Ireland on 21 October 1685. He was for a time educated in Drogheda Grammar School.[2] His grandfather, Arthur Forbes, first earl, died when young Forbes was about twelve years of age. Coming to London with his grandmother in 1702, he introduced himself to Admiral George Churchill, then first of the council to the Lord High Admiral, Prince George of Denmark, and sought to enter the navy.[3] Churchill appointed him to the Royal Anne at Portsmouth, and made him a lieutenant in the marines. Forbes was midshipman on HMS St George in 1704, and was with George Rooke at the Capture of Gibraltar, where he was on shore as aide-de-camp to the Prince of Hesse-Darmstadt and in the Battle of Málaga the same year. Forbes became heir to the earldom on the death of his elder brother, a captain in the Scots royals, from wounds received at the Battle of Blenheim.[3] In 1705, Forbes was second lieutenant of the frigate Triton, one of the most active cruisers in the navy. The Triton captured twenty-three French privateers in the Channel in fifteen months. He was in her at the siege of Ostend in 1706, where he was on shore, and first met, the Duke of Argyll, who commanded in the trenches. Forbes found his commission as captain of the Lynn frigate, in which he served as convoy to the Baltic Sea trade. The Lynn being ordered to the West Indies, Forbes was transferred to the Gosport, and on 3 January 1707 to the Leopard of 50 guns. On 6 March 1707, he was appointed brigadier in the 4th troop of horse-guards, of which the Duke of Argyll was captain and colonel.[3] The brigadiers of the horse-guards—styled in their commissions 'corporals,’ and in society 'captains'—were commissioned officers ranking with lieutenants of horse.[4] Forbes did duty with his troop until appointed to command the Sunderland of 60 guns, part of the western squadron under Lord Dursley, afterwards third Earl Berkeley. In 1708, Forbes became exempt from his troop and a brother of the Trinity House. In May 1709, he left his ship to do duty with his troop at Windsor, where ""his sprightliness of genius and politeness of manner recommended him to Queen Anne"",[5] at whose desire he was appointed to the Grafton of 70 guns. Forbes, who in the meantime had married, sailed for the Mediterranean with Sir John Norris in 1710. Charles III of Spain (afterwards the emperor Charles VI) then had his court at Barcelona, and Norris stationed some ships off the coast of Catalonia, the command of which was assigned to Forbes, who was directed to co-operate as much as possible with the Spanish court, and was permitted to reside on shore. Two Genoese ships of war, of 50 and 70 guns respectively, were at Cadiz taking in specie, alleged to be for the use of the French faction in Italy. The Spanish king proposed that Forbes should put out to sea and seize the vessels on their return voyage. Forbes explained that England was at peace with the Genoese republic; but being pressed by the king, and the queen offering him her sign-manual for his indemnification, he started with his own ship, the Grafton of 70 guns, and the Chatham of 50 guns, Captain Nicholas Haddock, took the Genoese ships into Port Mahon, discharged the officers and crews to shore, landed the specie, amounting to 1,600,000 dollars, and returned with the ships to Barcelona. Charles III, greatly pleased, made Forbes a grant of the duty payable at the mint for coinage of the amount, and urged him to go back to Menorca and fetch the specie.[3] Forbes, doubting the legality of the capture, excused himself until he should receive instructions from home, or from General Stanhope, the British ambassador and commander-in-chief in Spain, and, to avoid any appearance of backwardness, set out to confer with Stanhope. He joined the part of the allied army under Marshal Staremberg, and was slightly wounded while charging with Brigadier Lepell's regiment at the battle of Villaviciosa, 10 December 1710. Stanhope had surrendered at Brihuega the day previous. Forbes returned to Barcelona, and found orders from home forbidding the disposal of the Genoese treasure, which sorely disconcerted the Spanish court. Forbes came to England bearing an autograph letter from Charles III to Queen Anne. Eventually, the British government decided to retain the capture and indemnify the Genoese republic. In the end, Forbes accepted £ 6,000 in lieu of what had promised to prove a large fortune.[6] In January 1711, the Duke of Argyll was appointed to the command in Spain. He set out leaving Forbes, who was to serve with him, in London to solicit supplies for the army, which was short of money. Forbes obtained an order for eight hundred thousand dollars of the Genoese treasure, and set off, riding through the Netherlands, Germany, the Tyrol, and Italy to Genoa, where he took ship, with such despatch that he reached Barcelona in twenty-one days from England. During that year, he served with the army in Spain, at the head of three hundred cavalrymen drafted from home, whom Argyll purposed to form into a new regiment of horse under Forbes's command. The regiment was never completed, as peace negotiations were too far advanced. A return of the army in Spain, dated 19 February 1712, is in Treasury Papers, cxliv. 23, and is the only paper of any interest entered under Forbes's name in the Calendars of State Papers",0,0.0
"Andrew Hamilton, a Scottish lawyer, made a significant impact on the legal profession in the Thirteen Colonies, particularly in Philadelphia. Known for his legal victory in the famous John Peter Zenger case, Hamilton's life and career were marked by his commitment to justice and his defense of freedom of the press.

Born in Scotland in 1676, Andrew Hamilton came from a humble background. He grew up in a time of political and religious turmoil, as Scotland was transitioning from Presbyterianism to Episcopalianism. Little is known about his early life, but it is believed that he received a basic education before immigrating to the American colonies.

Hamilton settled in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in the early 1700s. At that time, Philadelphia was an emerging center of trade and commerce, attracting individuals seeking opportunities. Hamilton wasted no time establishing himself as a lawyer, quickly gaining recognition for his legal expertise and eloquence in the courtroom.

In terms of education, Hamilton may have had little formal training in law. However, he was undoubtedly well-read and possessed a keen intellect. He became well-versed in the principles of British common law, which formed the foundation of the colonial legal system.

Throughout his career, Hamilton handled many notable cases. His most famous case, and the one that secured his place in history, was his defense of John Peter Zenger in 1735. Zenger, a printer and journalist, was accused of seditious libel for publishing critical articles against the colonial governor of New York.

Hamilton's defense strategy was revolutionary for its time. He argued that truth should be a defense against accusations of libel. This was a departure from English common law, which at the time did not allow truth to be used as a defense in cases of libel. Hamilton argued that the freedom of the press was essential for a functioning democracy and that public officials should be subject to scrutiny and criticism.

Hamilton's eloquent defense won over the jury, and Zenger was acquitted. This case was a pivotal moment in the history of freedom of the press, as it established a precedent for the protection of journalistic opinion and criticism against government officials. It laid the groundwork for future legal protections of free speech and press in the United States.

Apart from the Zenger case, Hamilton's career was filled with notable achievements. He served as the attorney general of Pennsylvania from 1717 to 1727, representing the colony in various legal matters. He was also a successful merchant and land speculator, amassing a considerable fortune during his lifetime.

Hamilton's impact on the legal profession cannot be overstated. His defense of freedom of the press established a crucial precedent in the young American legal system. His argument that truth should be a defense against libel accusations was eventually adopted by many jurisdictions, shaping the evolution of libel laws.

Furthermore, Hamilton's emphasis on the importance of public scrutiny of government officials laid the groundwork for the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, which guarantees the right to freedom of speech and press. His advocacy for the principles of democracy and his commitment to justice set an example for future generations of lawyers and helped shape the legal landscape in the United States.

In conclusion, Andrew Hamilton, a Scottish lawyer who settled in Philadelphia, made a lasting impact on the legal profession in the Thirteen Colonies. His defense of freedom of the press in the John Peter Zenger case established a crucial precedent for the protection of journalistic opinion and criticism of government officials. Hamilton's commitment to justice, his eloquence in the courtroom, and his influence on the development of libel laws and the First Amendment cemented his place in history as a pioneer of legal defense and advocate for the principles of democracy.",1,0.0
"Shopping quest... Moms day is coming so I need to make sure both Co and my mom both get something good, I will take Chantelle out after 20(maybe) to buy something personal from her. I also need to restock my traveling supplies, I am off to Allentown, Pa next week for training for the new job. I haven't traveled yet as a woman, should be interesting, I may bring my one piece that camouflages really good and take a dip in the pool if they have one, and I have the nerve to. I might have lots of bravado, but I still get scared at certain situations. I also need to find a pair of femme athletic type sneakers. I don't have big feet, I bounce between 9-10 depending on the maker, but the way they make women's sneakers today, it looks like I still have man feet. Trying to find a nice purple or pink accented pair, not too girly but somewhat girly. I also am on a very special quest for a book. I need it as a reminder and I think it will be good to lend to some trans friends when the discussion of am I real comes up. I remember my nutty highschool history teacher Mr. Boyles talking to us about it and how he gave it to his daughter on her 16th birthday to remind her that she is worthy without peer praise, it is the Velveteen Rabbit. The story follows a stuffed toy rabbit that wants to be real so bad, and that is all he ever thinks about(sound familiar) he tries so hard to be real, and it tells about being real in a good way. I am going to buy an extra copy for a friend who is having a rough time and thinks she will never be real, hope it helps her. I also need to restock on writing supplies to work on my book. I have the chapter to work on that follows the crazy times of my youth, no roof sometimes, other times no car, and my life with Co. Not going to be an easy thing to write. I will also go back and rewrite about coming out, and start on rlt so much has happened in the months since starting rlt fulltime. Half of me is proud that it has been over 3 months already, the other half goes ""only three months, felt like a year or two?"" It has been the hardest time of my life, but also in some fucked up way the happiest too. I started another book on how to make battle plans as I call them for transition and for life in general. I have reconsidered and still am contemplating it. I know I don't seem like I have been doing this long, but I was given a very important life changing lesson in life planning/achieving one's goals, I just changed it a bit to focus more on this. I need to share it. That is not where the problem lies. The problem is that I am afraid I have been too much of a cheerleader, encouraging openly for others to try it if that is what they wish, pushing before they are ready. I tend to beat myself up, I know it shows here don't it? I for the most part still see the scared stupid little man I was, not the confident gal I am, so when I look back I think ""wow if an idiot like me can do it, anyone can."" WRONG, now that I am in a little deeper I see lots of pain, pain from failing or fear of failing. I don't want to add pain to others lives. One needs to be totally ready themselves to do this. This isn't for the faint of heart and if you do not do it with all you got, and believe it down to the very molecular level of your heart, you will fail. I can't help you, only you can. I will contemplate my plan book somemore, and sit on it, like my sci-fi book that is sitting and spinning right now. As I rebuild my life and get things back one by one, I will reexamine projects and writings to see what is good and what is bird cage liner. Oh well better get some pet birds again, I have a feeling I will have lots of liner. I am pretty sure I will make some money one day doing this, it just comes so natural and I get compliments all the time, just need to finish a project and go for it. Appointment for saving.. Cousin Mitch got a hold of me today and we set up an appointment for my saving, the Tuesday I get back from training. I know it is a waste of time,but if I don't let him try, he won't go away. I am very comfortable with my spirituality, and I know the bible pretty good and I am prepared to be beaten with it. The problem is I beat back, I have found, and had it confirmed by others, like that trans goddess Calpernia, that the best way to beat a bible beater is with the bible. It is such a huge book, you are sure to find something your accuser or savior is doing in their own life that is wrong. Oh yeah I should mention, THERE ISN'T ANYTHING IN THE BIBLE AGAINST THIS. There is no ""thou shall not be happy, and become congruent"". There is nothing about changing sex in the bible, yet the religious right still feel it is wrong. There is nothing about computers in the bible are they evil? You see my point I am sure. Well I guess I will be studying the bible in the hotel and adding ammo to my notes. But who knows, maybe I will be posting on the 19th that I have been saved and made",0,0.0
"As I sit here in my quiet, cozy study, memories of my recent adventure to the Maritime provinces of Canada flood my mind. Traveling always leaves me with a sense of wonder and a new perspective on the world around me. These experiences offer me a chance to reflect on life, both the extraordinary and the mundane.

The landscape of the Maritime provinces was unlike anything I had ever seen before. Rolling hills and vast stretches of untouched beauty greeted me at every turn. As I stood on the edge of the cliffs overlooking the stunning Bay of Fundy, I couldn't help but marvel at the sheer power of nature. The changing tides were a reminder of the eternal ebb and flow of time. It was a humbling experience, reminding me of the insignificance of my own existence in the grand scheme of things.

But it wasn't just the awe-inspiring scenery that captivated me; it was the little details that made the trip truly memorable. One such detail was the abundance of sweet corn that seemed to be available everywhere we turned. The sight of the golden, juicy kernels filled me with a childlike excitement. Each bite was a burst of sweetness, a taste of the land itself. It made me appreciate the simplicity and purity of nature's gifts.

Upon returning home, I was greeted by a shift in the social structure of our little flock of chickens. Over the course of my absence, it seemed that the once docile and timid hens had transformed into assertive and confident leaders. The pecking order had shifted, and with it, the dynamics of their little community. It made me reflect on the fluidity of relationships and the constant evolution of social structures. It was a gentle reminder that even the seemingly insignificant creatures of this world experience growth and change.

As I look back on these travel experiences and observations, I can't help but feel a sense of gratitude. Gratitude for the opportunity to explore new places, to witness the wonders of nature, and to gain a deeper understanding of the world we inhabit. Each journey leaves an indelible mark on my soul, shaping the person I am becoming.

Traveling, to me, is not just about ticking off destinations on a bucket list. It is about immersing myself in the unfamiliar, stepping out of my comfort zone, and opening my heart and mind to new experiences. It is through these experiences that I am reminded of the beauty and diversity of our world, and the interconnectedness of all living creatures.

So, as I sit here, penning down my thoughts on paper, I can't help but feel a longing for more adventures, more moments of discovery, and more opportunities to broaden my horizons. For it is through these journeys that I find myself, my purpose, and my place in this vast and ever-changing world.",1,0.0
"As I drove down the narrow country road, surrounded by lush greenery and the sound of chirping birds, I couldn't help but feel a sense of anticipation. I was about to visit a remote farmhouse to attend to a pregnant woman, and my mind was filled with a mix of excitement and nervousness. It wasn't often that I had the opportunity to venture into such remote areas, away from the hustle and bustle of the city.

As the car made its way through the winding road, I caught a glimpse of a figure standing by the side of the road. It was Mr. Tarn, the husband of the pregnant woman who had called for my assistance. He looked somewhat out of place, dressed in worn-out jeans and a faded flannel shirt, his hands stained with dirt. His face bore the unmistakable signs of hard work and a life spent outdoors.

Mr. Tarn's eyes locked with mine as the car rolled to a stop. He approached with a cautious yet determined stride. There was a hint of worry creasing his weathered face, but also an air of resilience. I could tell that he was used to taking matters into his own hands, but the situation had grown beyond his control, hence the call for medical help.

As I stepped out of the car, a friendly but protective dog bounded towards us from the farmhouse. It barked loudly, its tail wagging furiously. Mr. Tarn patted its head with firm affection before signaling it to go back. The dog, seemingly satisfied, trotted away, leaving us to make our way towards the house.

We walked through a yard surrounded by a stone wall, the air thick with the scent of earth and vibrant blooms. The stones were weathered and moss-covered, a testament to the history of this farmhouse and the generations that had come before. The sound of a distant creek added a soothing melody to the rustic ambiance.

As we approached the front door, Mr. Tarn paused for a moment, his hand hovering hesitantly before finally knocking. The door creaked open, revealing a warm and inviting interior. The furniture, although simple, exuded a sense of home and comfort. The walls were adorned with family photos, capturing moments frozen in time.

Inside, I was greeted by Mrs. Tarn, a woman with a round belly and a smile that seemed to hold both excitement and apprehension. Her eyes sparkled with anticipation as she invited us into the wooden kitchen. The air was filled with the aroma of freshly baked bread, a delightful distraction from the tension that hung in the room.

I wasted no time in setting up my medical equipment, carefully arranging the instruments on the worn-out countertop. Mrs. Tarn sat down on a wooden chair, her hands resting gently on her swollen belly. Mr. Tarn stood nearby, his eyes never leaving her, a mix of worry and adoration evident in his gaze.

As I began my examination, I couldn't help but notice how Mr. Tarn hovered close, offering a reassuring touch whenever his wife winced in discomfort. His rough hands, which had spent countless hours tending to the land, now took on the role of a gentle caregiver.

Through the course of the examination, I learned more about the Tarns. They had lived on this remote farm for generations, cherishing the simplicity and serenity it offered. But now, with the impending arrival of their child, they were faced with the reality that their isolated existence might need to be adjusted.

Despite the challenges that lay ahead, Mr. Tarn's dedication to his wife and unborn child was unwavering. He was determined to provide the best care possible, working tirelessly to ensure a safe and comfortable environment for his growing family.

As I prepared to leave, I couldn't help but feel a sense of awe at the resilience and strength displayed by Mr. Tarn. In a world filled with modern conveniences and instant gratification, he and his wife had chosen a life rooted in simplicity and self-sufficiency. Their lives were intertwined with the land, and they faced the joys and hardships that came with it head-on.

As I stepped back into my car, leaving behind the remote farmhouse, I couldn't help but feel gratitude for the opportunity to witness such a remarkable journey. The experience had reminded me of the beauty that exists in the most unexpected places and the strength that resides within the human spirit, even in the face of uncertainty.",1,0.0
"Residual dipolar coupling (RDC) is a valuable tool in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy that provides crucial information for determining the three-dimensional structures of molecules, especially in macromolecular systems. NMR spectroscopy is an indispensable technique in structural biology, helping scientists understand the relationships between molecular structure and function. The RDC phenomenon arises from incomplete molecular reorientation during the course of NMR experiments due to weak interactions with residual molecular alignment, resulting in a detectable splitting pattern in the NMR spectra.

In a traditional solution-state NMR experiment, molecules tumble freely in solution, leading to rapid isotropic reorientation. As a result, the dipolar couplings between nuclear spins average out to zero, making them invisible in the NMR spectra. However, the situation changes when the rotational diffusion of molecules is restricted, causing the dipolar couplings to manifest as a set of orientational constraints.

The presence of residual alignment is particularly relevant in systems with partially ordered structures, such as liquid crystals, weakly aligned solutions, or proteins in the presence of weak alignment media. In these cases, NMR experiments can yield valuable structural information beyond what is obtainable from traditional nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE)-based methods alone.

To measure the residual dipolar couplings, various methods have been devised, each with its advantages and limitations. One such method is the alignment tensor approach, which determines the alignment tensor (commonly represented by the Saupe matrix) that describes the orientational distribution of molecules. This method requires multiple alignment media with different viscosities, which allows for the determination of the alignment tensor by analyzing the dependence of the measured dipolar couplings on the alignment medium. The alignment tensor provides insights into the relative orientations of the internuclear vectors in the molecule.

Another widely used method is the correlation of RDCs with structural parameters. By comparing experimental RDCs with those calculated from a set of trial structures, the best-fit structural model can be obtained. This method involves computational tools such as molecular dynamics simulations or monte carlo algorithms, which incorporate the RDC measurements as constraints during the iterative refinement process.

The advantages of using RDC measurements over traditional NOE-based structure determinations are manifold. Firstly, RDCs contain long-range structural information and allow for the determination of global folds and relative orientations of structural motifs. NOEs, on the other hand, are limited to short-range information and are influenced by local dynamics and conformational changes. Secondly, RDC measurements complement NOE data by providing orthogonal constraints, which improve the accuracy and precision of structural models. Combining RDC with NOE data offers a more complete picture of the molecular structure. Lastly, RDC-based methods are particularly useful in studying flexible or partially disordered systems, where traditional NOE-based methods face challenges due to the lack of defined structural constraints.

In recent years, there have been significant advancements in RDC-based methodologies, making them more accessible and accurate. For example, the use of solid-state NMR techniques allows for the measurement of RDCs in systems with highly ordered structures, such as membranes or amyloid fibrils. Additionally, the incorporation of RDC measurements in hybrid methods, such as X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), or small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), has shown promising results, leading to more precise and reliable structural models.

In conclusion, residual dipolar couplings in NMR spectroscopy offer valuable insights into the structure and dynamics of macromolecular systems. By measuring the dipolar couplings between nuclear spins, RDC-based methods provide long-range structural information, complementing traditional NOE-based techniques. These methods are particularly useful in elucidating global folds, relative orientations, and conformational dynamics of partially ordered systems. With further advancements in experimental techniques and computational tools, the use of RDC measurements is expected to continue growing in importance for structural determination in the field of NMR spectroscopy and structural biology as a whole.",1,0.0
"Dean Barry Austin (born 26 April 1970) is an English football manager and former professional player who is currently head of recruitment at Coventry City. As a player, he was a defender who notably played in the Premier League for Tottenham Hotspur, making 124 appearances for the club over a six-year spell. He also notably played in the Football League for Crystal Palace where he made the most appearances of his career. He would also play professionally for Southend United and at non-league level for St Albans City and Woking. Following retirement, he became manager of Farnborough Town, and then went on to hold coaching roles at Southend United, Watford, Reading, Crystal Palace, Bolton Wanderers and Notts County. In April 2018, Austin was appointed manager of Northampton Town, initially in a caretaker capacity, but was dismissed in September of the same year. At the age of 12, Austin managed to get on the Watford books and also played for Sunday League side Forest United. At the age of 17, he came back to Watford and played for the under-18s. He then joined non-league side St Albans City. Austin was signed by Southend manager David Webb from St Albans for £14,000 in 1990 and made his debut on 10 April, as the ""Shrimpers"" held Burnley to a 0–0 draw.[3] He went on to play the last seven games of the 1989–90 season as Southend were automatically promoted to the Third Division after defeating Peterborough 2–0 on the final day of the season. He scored his first goal for the club on 4 September 1990 in the Rumblelows Cup against Aldershot. In the 1990–91 season he received an injury and was forced to miss out on the beginning of the season, but after recovering he became an integral part of the team as Southend just missed out on the Division 3 title. He scored two more goals for Southend in the 1991–92 season, both in the league. Southend had briefly topped the Second Division after the early Boxing Day games but eventually fell away to mid table in their first season at this level, ending hopes of a unique third successive promotion and a place in the new FA Premier League.[4] His form attracted interest from bigger clubs and midway through the season Derby County approached Austin, but he felt he could hold out for bigger clubs. He ended up being signed by Tottenham Hotspur, the club he supported as a child by manager Terry Venables for £375,000. In all competitions, he had made 109 appearances for Southend, scoring three goals.[5] Austin made his debut on 22 August 1992 coming on as a sub for Terry Fenwick in a Premier League match against Crystal Palace.[6] His first season at Spurs was rather successful, Tottenham finished in 8th place. The following Season he suffered a broken leg against Oldham, on a day when Tottenham went top of the League. By the time Dean returned to fitness Spurs were in a relegation battle under Ossie Ardilles. However, next season he was back in the team and enjoying his best form ever under Gerry Francis Tottenham reached the semi-final of the FA Cup, only to lose to eventual winners Everton 4–1.[7] Towards the end of this season Austin suffered a knee injury which resulted in three operations. Austin struggled for fitness over the next two years before suffering another injury to his other knee resulting in him being out for six months and not returning until February 98. He saw out his contract and was reunited with Terry Venables at Crystal Palace under the Bosman ruling. In all competitions, he made 154 appearances for Tottenham but without scoring. Austin linked up with former manager Terry Venables at Crystal Palace, although Venables only stayed for six months. The first six months were particularly difficult but after 18 months Austin became a firm fans favourite when he alone decided to stay at the club when Palace entered administration. He accepted a massive pay cut,[8] and he marked his return to the team by scoring the winner against Norwich City.[9] The club, however went into administration in 1999 and defied the odds, staying in Division 1 despite being tipped to go down. Dean was named club captain in the summer of 1999. But having made 142 appearances for Palace and scoring six times, while not playing under Trevor Francis and suffering with both knee and foot injuries he decided to call time on his professional career. After Austin had left Crystal Palace he was asked by Woking manager Glenn Cockerill to come and help them out of trouble. He was appointed club captain by Cockerill as the club narrowly avoided relegation from the Football Conference on his 33rd birthday and Austin decided then and there to call time on his playing career and retired from playing. After a brief spell coaching in Watford's academy in 2003–04, Austin was employed as director of football of Farnborough Town in June 2004, where within a few weeks and only two weeks before the season started, he was asked to take over as manager. Caught in the middle of an ownership battle which resulted in the chairman Tony Theo leaving the club, Austin dealt with numerous financial issues before leaving in February 2005 with the club just outside the relegation zone. Farnborough lost the next 14 games and were relegated before entering administration.[10] In the summer of 2005, Austin returned to Southend with Steve Tilson as head of recruitment and coach. He was an integral part of Southend winning two successive promotions from League Two into the Championship and was responsible for developing young players such as Michael Kightly, Stuart O'Keefe and Gary Hooper. After three successful years, Austin left Southend to become assistant manager to Brendan Rodgers at Watford. A strong end to the season saw Reading approach Rodgers and his team to take over from the departing Steve Coppell. The whole team were relieved of their duties in December 2009",0,0.0
"Playing poker at a casino for the first time was something I had always wanted to do. I had watched movies and TV shows where characters strolled into glamorous casinos, sat at the poker table, and walked away with piles of cash. It seemed exhilarating and glamorous, but also nerve-wracking. I had played poker with friends before, but playing in a casino felt like a whole different ballgame.

As I stepped into the casino, my heart started racing. The bright lights, the sound of slot machines, and the energy in the air made me feel both excited and anxious. I made my way towards the poker room, trying to appear more composed than I actually felt.

When I entered the poker room, I saw rows of tables, each filled with players focused on their chips and cards. The atmosphere was intense, but I decided to go for it. I picked a table with a moderate buy-in and took a seat. The dealer greeted me with a nod and a smile, and the game began.

I started with a conservative approach, playing tight and cautiously. I didn't want to lose my chips too quickly. As the hands progressed, I started to loosen up a bit, playing a few more hands and taking some calculated risks. I observed the other players, trying to pick up on their playing style and tendencies.

One thing I quickly learned was the importance of having a poker face. Some players were masters at it, not revealing any emotion or information about their hand. Others, like me, found it hard to hide their excitement or disappointment. It was a skill I knew I needed to improve on.

As the game continued, I found myself in a few tight spots. There were times when I had a great hand, but my opponents would read me like a book. Other times, I made some daring bluffs that paid off handsomely. The ups and downs were part of the adrenaline rush that kept me hooked.

The other players at the table ranged from experienced regulars to fellow newcomers like me. Some were friendly and chatty, while others were silent and focused. I struck up conversations whenever possible, trying to learn from their experiences and gain some insight into their strategies.

The dealers, too, played a crucial role. They were knowledgeable, professional, and always made sure the game ran smoothly. I appreciated their patience with my occasional fumbling and confusion. They were also quick to answer any questions I had, which made me feel more comfortable and less like a fish out of water.

As the night wore on, I realized that winning or losing wasn't the only measure of a successful poker session. Yes, it was great to win some pots and see my chip stack grow, but the real joy came from the thrill of outsmarting opponents, making good decisions, and reading the table.

I also discovered that having fun was fundamental. The pressure to win could sometimes overshadow the enjoyment of the game. I reminded myself to relax, have a laugh, and appreciate the experience. After all, poker was a game meant to be enjoyed.

By the end of the night, I had won a few hands and lost a few. I didn't walk away with piles of cash like the movie characters, but I did walk away with a sense of fulfillment. Playing poker at a casino for the first time had been an adventure, and I couldn't wait to do it again.

Playing poker at a casino for the first time was a nerve-wracking but ultimately thrilling experience. The atmosphere was intense, the players were skilled, and the stakes were high. But through it all, I discovered a newfound love for the game. It wasn't just about the money; it was about the strategy, the psychology, and the enjoyment of the game itself. Win or lose, poker was an exhilarating ride that I couldn't wait to take again.",1,0.0
"Ladies and gentlemen,

Thank you for joining me tonight at the Democratic National Convention. It is an honor to stand before you and speak on behalf of the Democratic Party. Tonight, I want to discuss the values and principles that have guided our party throughout history, the challenges we face today, and the vision we have for the future of our great nation.

As Democrats, we believe in the power of the people. We believe that America's strength lies in the diversity of its people, and that everyone, regardless of their background, deserves equal opportunities and a fair shot at achieving the American dream. We believe in the power of government to serve as a force for good, to protect and uplift the most vulnerable among us, and to ensure that everyone has access to quality education, healthcare, and economic opportunities.

Contrast this with the Republican Party's view, which often prioritizes the interests of the few over the needs of the many. They champion tax cuts for the wealthy while neglecting investments in education, healthcare, and infrastructure that benefit the middle class and working families. We believe in a different approach, one that recognizes the importance of investing in our people and our future.

John Kerry, our presidential nominee, understands these values and will fight for them as president. He has dedicated his life to public service, from his courageous service in Vietnam to his time in the Senate. John Kerry believes in a strong and secure America, one that is respected worldwide. He has the experience and the temperament to lead our nation through these challenging times.

Let me remind you of the progress we made during my time as president. We turned a record deficit into a surplus, created over 22 million new jobs, and saw the lowest crime rates in decades. We expanded access to healthcare for millions of children and passed the Family and Medical Leave Act. We took steps to protect our environment and promoted peace and prosperity around the world. These achievements were the result of making the right choices and putting people above politics.

But our work is not done. We face new challenges today, from a struggling economy to a changing climate, from an ever-evolving global landscape to the threat of terrorism. We need a leader who understands these challenges and has the vision and the determination to confront them head-on. John Kerry is that leader.

We must also remember that unity is essential to our success. As Democrats, we must come together to rally behind our nominee and to work towards a common goal: a stronger, fairer, and more prosperous America. Our party represents the hopes and dreams of millions of Americans, and it is our responsibility to bring them together in pursuit of a brighter future.

In closing, I urge you all to consider the choices before us. The election is not just about John Kerry or the Democratic Party; it is about the future of our nation. We have the power to shape that future, to build a society that is more just, more equal, and more compassionate. We must choose a leader who will fight for these values, who will put the interests of the American people above all else.

Tonight, I ask for your support. Let us stand together as Democrats, united in our mission to create a better tomorrow. Let us choose John Kerry as our next president, and let us work together to build a future that we can all be proud of.

Thank you, and may God bless you all, and may God bless the United States of America.",1,-1.0
"As our car made its way through the winding road, I couldn't help but feel a mix of excitement and apprehension. We were heading to San Nicolas, my mother's small hometown, for the very first time. The thought of exploring a place so different from the bustling city where I grew up intrigued me, yet at the same time, I couldn't shake off the sense of being an outsider.

The town of San Nicolas unfolded before my eyes like a page from a storybook. It was a picturesque place, with colorful houses dotting the landscape. The streets were narrow, barely wide enough for two cars to pass each other. The air was crisp and pure, devoid of the city's noise and pollution. It felt like stepping into a different era, where time moved at a slower pace.

As we parked in front of the police station, my mother's eyes lit up with familiarity. She had grown up in this town, and memories of her childhood were etched in every corner. Inside the modest building, we were greeted by Sergeant Ramirez, a kind-hearted man with a twinkle in his eyes. He welcomed my mother with open arms, reminiscing about their shared history. I, on the other hand, felt like a stranger, an outsider trying to find my place in this tight-knit community.

Leaving the police station, we walked down the sunlit streets towards the house of my mother's childhood friend, Doña Rosa. As we approached the old, weathered house, I couldn't help but notice the faded paint on the walls, a testament to the passage of time. Doña Rosa was overjoyed to see my mother, embracing her tightly. They spoke in whispers, sharing stories of their youth, while I stood on the periphery, feeling invisible. It was as if I was observing a reunion that had no room for me.

As the day wore on, the three of us sat on the porch, sipping tea and watching the world go by. The town seemed to come alive with activity. Neighbors greeted each other cordially, exchanging pleasantries and news. Children played in the streets, their laughter echoing through the air. Life in San Nicolas seemed simple and uncomplicated, a stark contrast to the hectic pace of the city.

Suddenly, a loud bleating sound interrupted our conversation. Turning towards the commotion, I couldn't help but burst into laughter. A goat, aptly named Billy, had wandered onto the porch and was now nibbling on the flowers in Doña Rosa's garden. The sight of this mischievous creature brought a welcome sense of lightheartedness to the day, reminding me that even in a place that felt foreign, there could be moments of unexpected joy.

As the sun began to set, casting a warm orange glow over the town, my mother and I bid farewell to Doña Rosa. The emotions that had swirled within me throughout the day now settled into a mix of nostalgia and gratitude. San Nicolas had given me a glimpse into my mother's past, into a world that was both familiar and distant. I realized that it didn't matter if I felt like an outsider in this town. What mattered was the connection I had formed with my mother, witnessing the place that had shaped her into the person she was today.

As we drove away from San Nicolas, I carried with me a newfound appreciation for the simple beauty of small-town life. The memories of that day would forever be etched in my heart, a reminder that sometimes, stepping outside of our comfort zones can lead to unexpected discoveries. And as for Billy the goat, I couldn't help but smile, knowing that his misadventures would forever be a part of my San Nicolas story.",1,0.0
"Mary Leadbeater (/ˈlɛdˌbɛtər/; December 1758 – 27 June 1826) was an Irish author and diarist. Leadbeater was born in Ballitore, Athy, County Kildare, Ireland. She was the daughter of Richard Shackleton (1726–1792) by his second wife, Elizabeth Carleton, and granddaughter of Abraham Shackleton, schoolmaster of Edmund Burke. Her parents were Quakers. She was thoroughly educated, and her literary studies were aided by Aldborough Wrightson, a man of great ability who had been educated at Ballitore school and had returned to die there. In 1784 she travelled to London with her father and paid several visits to Burke's town house, where she met Sir Joshua Reynolds and George Crabbe. She also went to Beaconsfield, and on her return wrote a poem in praise of the place and its owner, which was acknowledged by Burke, 13 December 1784, in a long and eulogistic letter.[1] On her way home she visited, at Selby, Yorkshire, some primitive Quakers whom she described in her journal. In 1791 she married William Leadbeater, a former pupil of her father, and they resided in Ballitore. Leadbeater, who traced his descent from the Huguenot family of Le Batre, was a small farmer and landowner, and his wife kept the village post office. They had six children among them Lydia Fisher, Mary, Margaret and Sarah who married John Barrington a member of the Quaker family who made candles and soap. On her father's death, Leadbeater received a tender letter of consolation from Burke.[2] She had from time to time written poems, and in 1794 published anonymously in Dublin Extracts and Original Anecdotes for the Improvement of Youth, which begins with ""some account of the society of the people call Quakers"", contains several poems on secular subjects, and concludes with ""divine odes"". She was in Carlow on Christmas Day 1796 when the news arrived that the French fleet had been seen off Bantry, and she describes the march out of the troops. On 28 May 1797 Burke wrote one of his last letters to her.[3] Ballitore was occupied in 1798 first by yeomanry, ""from whose bosom,"" wrote Mary Leadbeater, ""pity seemed banished.""[4] Next came the quartering of soldiers on the town, the Suffolk Fencibles and the Ancient Britons, who commenced torturing and flogging the inhabitants.[5] ""The village, once so peaceful, exhibited a scene of tumult and dismay; and the air rang with the shrieks of the sufferers, and the lamentations of those who beheld them suffer,"" she wrote. A force of about 300 rebels then occupied the town and carried out reprisals, but who fled the following day on the approach of a force of soldiers. These soldiers in turn exacted reprisals on the locals, even killing the local doctor, Johnston.[6] Mary Leadbeater wrote of the killing of her friend: ""He was alone and unarmed when seized, and I believe had never raised his hand to injure any one."" The soldiers sacked the town,[7] burned many houses and smashed up the rest, and one of them almost killed Mary Leadbeater, who had to flee with a number of other women.[4] In 1808 she published Poems with a metrical version of her husband's prose translation of Maffæus Vegio's Thirteenth Book of the Æneid. The poems are sixty-seven in number; six are on subjects relating to Burke, one in praise of the spa of Ballitore, and the remainder on domestic and local subjects. She next published in 1811 Cottage Dialogues among the Irish Peasantry, of which four editions, with some alterations and additions, had appeared by 1813. The dialogues are on such subjects as dress, a wake, going to the fair, a spinning match, cow-pock, cookery, and matrimony. William P. Le Fanu (1774–1817) had suggested the design, and the object was to diffuse information about the peasantry. In 1813 she tried to instruct the rich on a similar plan in The Landlord's Friend. Intended as a sequel to Cottage Dialogues, in which persons of quality are made to discourse on such topics as beggars, spinning-wheels, and Sunday in the village, Tales for Cottagers, which she brought out in 1814 in conjunction with Elizabeth Shackleton, is a return to the original design. The tales illustrate perseverance, temper, economy, and are followed by a curious moral play, Honesty is the best policy. In 1822 she concluded this series with Cottage Biography, being a Collection of Lives of the Irish Peasantry. The lives are those of real persons, and contain some interesting passages, especially in the life of James Dunn, a pilgrim to Loch Derg. Many traits of Irish country life appear in these books, and they preserve several of the idioms of the English-speaking inhabitants of the Pale. Memoirs and Letters of Richard and Elizabeth Shackleton … compiled by their Daughter was also issued in 1822 (new edition. 1849, edited by Lydia Ann Barclay). Her Biographical Notices of Members of the Society of Friends who were resident in Ireland appeared in 1823, and is a summary of their spiritual lives, with a scanty narrative of events. Her last work was The Pedlars, a Tale, published in 1824. Besides receiving letters from Burke, Leadbeater corresponded with, among others, Maria Edgeworth, George Crabbe, and Mrs Melesina Trench, and from the age of eleven kept a private journal. She died at Ballitore 27 June 1826, and was buried in the Quaker burial-ground there. She had several children, and one of her daughters, Mrs. Fisher, was the intimate friend of the poet and novelist Gerald Griffin. Leadbeater's best work, the Annals of Ballitore, was not printed till 1862, when it was brought out with the general title of The Leadbeater Papers (2 vols.) by Richard Davis Webb, a learned and patriotic printer, eager to preserve every truthful illustration of Irish life. It tells of the inhabitants and events of Ballitore from 1766 to 1823, and few books give a better idea of the character and feelings of Irish cottagers, of the premonitory signs of the rebellion of 1798, and of the horrors of the outbreak itself.

"Belief: Acceptance by the mind that something is true or real, often underpinned by an emotional or spiritual sense of certainty. Each one of us had been brought up with certain beliefs integrated into our timid brains, by our parents, religions, family and so on. Those are their opinions on issues about religion, life and whatâs right or wrong in general. Beliefs are handed to you, some received with doubts some accepted as truth. As we mature, some of us chose to yet follow the beliefs, some chose to ignore them and start afresh, and some like me, try to figure them out, deviate from some and bond with others, and create a want for knowing, coz knowing comes from within, it cannot be second hand. Speaking of me, I have been brought up by my father, a wonderful teacher, who taught me to first be a nice human being inside, right from my early childhood, I was taught to listen to the small voice inside, and follow it = If you can sleep peacefully after a day of interaction, without having to tuck back a thought, that consider that day well spent!! I remember a small book given to me, which contained the Hanuman Chalisa and parts of Bhagvad Gita with prose. At the time, it was only blind following of what I was being taught, and probably a thought of it as a hype, but the real world put me straight as soon as I reached my teens. Tough times have come and gone, and I have made wrong decisions, but never has my faith in my voice gone a decimal lowerâ¦ in fact, with each wrong decision, my acceptance level went a notch up Dark times were around, when I had thrown caution to the wind and went along with the self destructing flow of life, but was rescued halfway, by the beliefs that had set deep inside me. Soul!! Thatâs what they call our inner self, Soul â the little bit of part of our Maker inside us, the most important part of us. As I grown, in spirit, the small voice becomes a bit louder and louder, till itâs the only voice that I ever hear. It is my voice, my soul talking to me, and I chose to listen to its whispers, over the din created by the world around me. All during my existence, I have wondered who I am, what I am, not in the spiritual manner, but in materialistic world, figuring out where I am supposed to be, and when shall I reach my goal. While growing up, I used to look at my uncles and brothers and see them going to work, struggle with decisions, life in general, I used to wonder it that is what will happen to me. Looking at my aunts, bhabhis and Mom, following their life - Studying and then putting all the knowledge you gained on a shelf, to chose the life of a housewife, stay in shadows to see your family grow, and one fine day, while u are looking at the mirror, at the whites and grays in your hair, wondering where did all the time go?? What did you do? I still wonder if they are happy, a relative term, that differs from person to person. As a person, my definition of happiness is a bit of tears, some smiles, hunger for knowledge, recognizing mistakes, faults and admitting, maybe try to overcome them, and of course a peaceful night of sleep, where u donât have to tuck any thought away!! A popular statement is, ''If only '', which is heard all throughout our lives. I use it often as well; the most recent being If only I scored high, my life would be complete. Is it?? I scored, is my life any different, I donât think so, in fact I think I will end up working harder than ever, to keep the good scores up, maybe missing out on something while I am out to get something. If only, I would be satisfied with whatever I get. Wise Dr. Dyer writes in his collection: '' you will get what you deserve, no matter what!!"" It's preached in almost all the religions. So, work hard or less, you will only get what u deserve, the question here is not Do I deserve? But rather who decides whether I do? Who does the evaluation for me? Ok, for all the exams that I give, there is a professor who does the assessment for my scores, for all the dresses I buy and wear, I have friends, family and colleagues to judge my appearance I have a manager to appraise all my assignments at work, but who is the judge of my soul, Of my behavior, of my attitude towards life? I am being given several opinions on how best to live my life, what career to take, what dress to wear, what friends to have, what books to read. In the end, they are others opinions, my own?? If I use my right of having my own standpoint towards life's smallest decision â to stay in or go out with friends â If I chose to stay in, I am called a spoil sport and selfish. I am labeled as having attitude problem. Do I really have that attitude problem?? I donât happen to think so, I think I am permitted to have my own approach towards everything, and most importantly, abide by if I chose to, else I wouldnât have been given the means of doing so. I would rather have been born as a vegetable, or as a tree, though on a tangent, they too have their own freedom to express themselves, in whatever way they can. At times when I start thinking on these lines, I wonder who I should listen to, the voice inside me, or the clatter around me on the outside. They are my well-wishers, they are what",0,0.0
"Lead Paint: A Hazard for Health and the Environment

Lead paint has been used for centuries due to its durability and versatility. However, the hazards associated with lead paint have become increasingly apparent, leading to the implementation of regulations to protect human health and the environment. This article will explore the history, hazards, regulations, and impact of lead paint.

History:
Lead paint has a long history, dating back to ancient Roman times. Its durability and vibrant colors made it popular for use in homes, buildings, and even toys. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, lead paint was extensively used in many countries, especially in industrialized nations. It became a common ingredient in household paints due to its ability to resist moisture and wear.

Hazards:
The hazards of lead paint primarily stem from lead, a toxic heavy metal. When lead paint deteriorates or is disturbed, it can release lead particles into the air as dust or onto surfaces as flakes. This dust and flakes can be ingested or inhaled, posing a significant risk to human health, especially for children.

Children are particularly vulnerable to lead paint hazards because their bodies absorb lead more easily than adults. Even low levels of lead exposure in children can lead to serious health problems, including developmental delays, learning disabilities, lowered IQ, and behavioral issues. Adults exposed to lead paint may experience renal problems, high blood pressure, and fertility issues.

Regulations:
Recognizing the dangers of lead paint, many countries have implemented regulations to reduce its use and protect people from exposure. In the United States, the ""Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act"" was passed in 1971, which aimed to limit the use of lead paint in residential properties. Subsequently, the ""Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act"" was enacted in 1992, mandating measures to address lead paint hazards in housing.

Internationally, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and World Health Organization (WHO) have called for the phase-out of lead paint. The Global Alliance to Eliminate Lead Paint, established in 2011, works towards this goal by encouraging countries to adopt and enforce lead paint regulations.

Impact on Health and the Environment:
The impact of lead paint on health extends beyond individuals to the environment as a whole. When lead paint deteriorates, it can contaminate soil, water, and air. These contaminants can be absorbed by plants, animals, and humans, entering the food chain and posing risks to ecosystems.

Lead-based paint waste disposal is also a concern. Improper disposal or inadequate treatment of lead paint can lead to contamination of landfills and water bodies. This contamination can persist for years, continuing to pose risks to both human health and the environment.

Efforts to mitigate the impact of lead paint include lead paint testing, lead abatement programs, and educational campaigns. Testing for lead paint in homes and buildings is crucial to identifying areas of concern and taking necessary measures to address them. Lead abatement programs aim to remove or encapsulate lead paint, reducing the risk of exposure. Educational campaigns raise awareness about the dangers of lead paint and provide guidance on its safe handling and removal.

In conclusion, lead paint, once widely used due to its durability and aesthetic appeal, is now recognized as a significant hazard for human health and the environment. Exposure to lead paint can lead to severe health problems, particularly for children. Governments and international organizations have implemented regulations and initiatives to limit the use of lead paint and mitigate its impact.

"The young man hurriedly dashed through the crowded streets of the snowy city, the chill of the winter air nipping at his cheeks. He had a pressing appointment and was running late, his mind consumed by the fear of missing out on an opportunity that could shape his future. Desperation fueled his steps as he spotted a yellow cab waiting by the curb.

Without hesitation, he flung open the door and jumped inside, not bothering to glance at the person occupying the backseat. ""To City Hall, please, and make it quick,"" he urged the driver, his voice tinged with impatience. The cab pulled away from the curb, merging into the sea of cars navigating the icy streets.

In the backseat, the young lady blinked in surprise, her emerald eyes widening as she observed the stranger who had barged into her cab. She was on her way to City Hall as well, but her calm demeanor contrasted starkly with the man's frenetic energy. She cleared her throat, attempting to catch his attention.

""Excuse me, but this is my cab,"" she politely pointed out, hoping to rectify the confusion. However, the young man was too preoccupied to notice, his gaze fixed on his watch as if time was slipping away with every passing second.

The young lady's patience wore thin as the minutes ticked by, and she tapped her foot nervously against the floor of the cab. ""Sir, I really need to get to City Hall as well,"" she insisted, her voice tinged with frustration. ""Could you please ask the driver to stop so that I can take another cab?""

The young man finally tore his gaze from his watch, his eyes meeting the young lady's for the first time. Something softened in his expression as he took in her exasperated but determined face. He hesitated for a moment, weighing his options before relenting.

""Fine,"" he grumbled reluctantly, signaling the driver to pull over. The cab came to a halt, its tires crunching against the snow-covered road. The young man stepped out hastily, his leather shoes skidding on the icy pavement. He reached into his pocket, fishing out a wad of cash to pay for the fare.

As he handed the money to the driver, the young man's eyes fell on the young lady who was already making her way out of the cab. Something stirred within him, a sense of curiosity that compelled him to ask, ""Why are you going to City Hall?""

The young lady paused, her hand resting on the door handle, surprised by the question. She turned to face him, her eyes searching his face for any hints of sincerity. ""I'm an architect,"" she replied, a hint of pride lacing her words.

The young man's eyes widened with intrigue, his initial annoyance dissipating. ""I'm meeting with the mayor,"" he confessed, a note of nervous excitement creeping into his voice. ""I've been given the opportunity to present my plans for a new housing project.""

There was a brief silence as the magnitude of their situation sunk in. In that moment, the young man and the young lady stood side by side on the bustling city street, two strangers connected by a twist of fate. Their eyes met once again, and this time, there was a glimmer of understanding, a shared recognition of the importance of their respective journeys.

With a newfound determination, the young man gestured towards another approaching cab, a silent invitation for the young lady to join him. ""Shall we share this one?"" he suggested, a faint smile tugging at the corners of his lips.

The young lady returned his smile, a spark of camaraderie lighting up her face. ""Yes,"" she agreed, stepping closer to him. ""After all, it seems we're destined to reach City Hall together.""

As they climbed into the cab, the doors closing behind them, the two strangers found themselves bound by more than just a shared destination. In that snowy, bustling city, their encounter had given birth to a bond that transcended the confines of a cab ride. Little did they know, the chance meeting would not only impact their own lives but also shape the future of the city they both held dear.",1,0.0
"Hello all - Its been a long time since I posted anything, but you will see through this post, that it has been a very very crazy time for me. So here it goes: about 3 weeks ago, I woke up looking at a pile of hair on my pillow, since I knew I didn't have a cat (especially not one that used the same shampoo as me), I ran my hand through my hair and came back with a handful of hair!! I ran to the bathroom and looked in the mirror as I was effortlessly removing handfuls of hair from my head. I called the doctor and he was not nearly as concerned as I was, but ordered some more blood work on me. I went to work and flew a four day trip, by the last day, I pretty much looked like a dog that had mange...little bald patches all over my head (my mom was sure it was only I who noticed it...she made this observation via the telephone not actually seeing my tragedy, and Tony , oblivious to all around him sometimes, said he didn't see anything) I got called into my supervisors office when I returned from the trip. It seems another flight attendant saw me and wrote me up...she thought I had something shaved into the side of my head!!! After that embarrassing ordeal, I decided when I got home I had no choice but to shave off all my hair. Right now I look like Powder (but not as skinny or as wierdly hot) cuz I have not hair or eyebrows. A few days later, the doctor called and said he got some of my lab work back. He asked if I was sure of my HIV diagnosis. I should point out that this is the doctor that I didn't like very much anyway. I laid into him... of course I am sure, I have been living with it for over 2 years. He let me finish, and explained that in researching my records he has found that every time my counts had been done (only when I was really sick) that my CD4 count (t-cells for those of you not in the know) would be all over the place... sometimes super high, other time super low. My viral load is a different story...it has always been undetectable. My new docs theory was I was too sick for my viral load to be undetectable... it would go against what HIV is all about. It's sole purpose is to wait for the body to be weakened and then replicate and attack, but that wasn't happening. He asked if he could do another HIV test. I told him I thought he was crazy but I would consent to the test. What I didn't tell him was that I had gone to the Holmes Clinic in Cincinnati (and HIV research hospital) for a second opinion right after I had seen him the first time. The clinic had taken a ton of blood for various tests, and some extra because I had consented to be used for studies. I called the clinic and told the doctor there what the other doctor said...he promised he would call as soon as he got my lab results back. he called the next day and told me that he thought perhaps my doc was on to something, my counts were virtually the same (very high CD4 and no viral load) he sent my study blood off to be tested for HIV proper. Now would be a good time to point out the history of my infection...after I found out I was positive (I had expected it to be poz) I freaked out. I got scared and never went back to a doctor till I got really sick and had no choice. I would placate friends with fake doctors visits cuz they wanted to know I was taking care of myself... but the fact of the matter is I HATE doctors and I was scared, so I would just say ""good news, counts are great"" and move on...never actually knowing what my counts were. When I would get really sick I would reluctantly go to the doctor and tell him ""by the way, I am HIV+ just in case that has anything to do with this"" The doctor would say ok and run my counts just to be sure the HIV wasn't out of control, and would always report just as my new doctor pointed out, various CD$ counts and undetectable viral load... to the unsuspecting doc that was great news. It meant the HIV was not taking over and it would be easy to treat whatever I was sick with. Fast Forward. Lab calls back and the doctor confirms there is no HIV... I am HIV-. The bad news is, that there is obviously an immune deficiancy problem, but they don't know whats causing it. The good news, I don't have AIDS. I didn't know if I should be happy, angry, sad, or scared. For over 2 years, HIV has ruled my life, it has completely shaped who I am and affected all my relationships. One of my dearest friends in the world came about because of an unfortunate situation regarding my HIV and his boyfriend (now of the ex variety). All of my friends had only known me as poz. My pledge brothers helped me deal with the news, my pledgemaster quietly keeping me from slipping into a bottomless pit of depression at the hand of the disease that I was convinced was going to take my life and that I would inadvertantly pass to all those that I cared for. My big brother getting visably angry when I compared my body to a toxic waste barrell and if the skin were punctured the poison would leak out and infect everyone close to me.

"common-sense view of all matters that came under his consideration. With a heart about as tender as other people's, he had a head as hard and impenetrable, and therefore, perhaps, as empty, as one of the iron pots which it was a part of his business to sell. The mother's character, on the other hand, had a strain of poetry in it, a trait of unworldly beauty,--a delicate and dewy flower, as it were, that had survived out of her imaginative youth, and still kept itself alive amid the dusty realities of matrimony and motherhood. So, Violet and Peony, as I began with saying, besought their mother to let them run out and play in the new snow; for, though it had looked so dreary and dismal, drifting downward out of the gray sky, it had a very cheerful aspect, now that the sun was shining on it. The children dwelt in a city, and had no wider play-place than a little garden before the house, divided by a white fence from the street, and with a pear-tree and two or three plum-trees overshadowing it, and some rose-bushes just in front of the parlor-windows. The trees and shrubs, however, were now leafless, and their twigs were enveloped in the light snow, which thus made a kind of wintry foliage, with here and there a pendent icicle for the fruit. ""Yes, Violet,--yes, my little Peony,"" said their kind mother, ""you may go out and play in the new snow."" Accordingly, the good lady bundled up her darlings in woollen jackets and wadded sacks, and put comforters round their necks, and a pair of striped gaiters on each little pair of legs, and worsted mittens on their hands, and gave them a kiss apiece, by way of a spell to keep away Jack Frost. Forth sallied the two children, with a hop-skip-and-jump, that carried them at once into the very heart of a huge snow-drift, whence Violet emerged like a snow-bunting, while little Peony floundered out with his round face in full bloom. Then what a merry time had they! To look at them, frolicking in the wintry garden, you would have thought that the dark and pitiless storm had been sent for no other purpose but to provide a new plaything for Violet and Peony; and that they themselves had beer created, as the snow-birds were, to take delight only in the tempest, and in the white mantle which it spread over the earth. At last, when they had frosted one another all over with handfuls of snow, Violet, after laughing heartily at little Peony's figure, was struck with a new idea. ""You look exactly like a snow-image, Peony,"" said she, ""if your cheeks were not so red. And that puts me in mind! Let us make an image out of snow,--an image of a little girl,--and it shall be our sister, and shall run about and play with us all winter long. Won't it be nice?"" ""Oh yes!"" cried Peony, as plainly as he could speak, for he was but a little boy. ""That will be nice! And mamma shall see it!"" ""Yes,"" answered Violet; ""mamma shall see the new little girl. But she must not make her come into the warm parlor; for, you know, our little snow-sister will not love the warmth."" And forthwith the children began this great business of making a snow-image that should run about; while their mother, who was sitting at the window and overheard some of their talk, could not help smiling at the gravity with which they set about it. They really seemed to imagine that there would be no difficulty whatever in creating a live little girl out of the snow. And, to say the truth, if miracles are ever to be wrought, it will be by putting our hands to the work in precisely such a simple and undoubting frame of mind as that in which Violet and Peony now undertook to perform one, without so much as knowing that it was a miracle. So thought the mother; and thought, likewise, that the new snow, just fallen from heaven, would be excellent material to make new beings of, if it were not so very cold. She gazed at the children a moment longer, delighting to watch their little figures,--the girl, tall for her age, graceful and agile, and so delicately colored that she looked like a cheerful thought more than a physical reality; while Peony expanded in breadth rather than height, and rolled along on his short and sturdy legs as substantial as an elephant, though not quite so big. Then the mother resumed her work. What it was I forget; but she was either trimming a silken bonnet for Violet, or darning a pair of stockings for little Peony's short legs. Again, however, and again, and yet other agains, she could not help turning her head to the window to see how the children got on with their snow-image. Indeed, it was an exceedingly pleasant sight, those bright little souls at their task! Moreover, it was really wonderful to observe how knowingly and skilfully they managed the matter. Violet assumed the chief direction, and told Peony what to do, while, with her own delicate fingers, she shaped out all the nicer parts of the snow-figure. It seemed, in fact, not so much to be made by the children, as to grow up under their hands, while they were playing and prattling about it. Their mother was quite surprised at this; and the longer she looked, the more and more surprised she grew. ""What remarkable children mine are!"" thought she, smiling with a mother's pride; and, smiling at herself, too, for being so proud of them. ""What other children could have made anything so like a little girl's figure out of snow at the first trial? Well; but now I must finish Peony's new frock, for his grandfather is coming to-morrow, and I want the little fellow to look handsome.""",0,0.0
"FLOWER 290 TALES OF SECRET EGYPT PART I TALES OF AB TABH I THE YASHMAK OF PEARLS The _duhr_, or noonday call to prayer, had just sounded from the minarets of the Mosques of Kalan and En-Nasr, and I was idly noting the negligible effect of the _adan_ upon the occupants of the neighboring shops--coppersmiths for the most part--when suddenly my errant attention became arrested. A mendicant of unwholesome aspect crouched in the shadow of the narrow gateway at the entrance to the Sk es-Sagh, or gold and silver bazaar, having his one serviceable eye fixed in a malevolent stare upon something or someone immediately behind me. It is part and parcel of my difficult profession to subdue all impulses and to think before acting. I sipped my coffee and selected a fresh cigarette from the silver box upon the rug beside me. In this interval I had decided that the one-eyed mendicant cherished in his bosom an implacable and murderous hatred for my genial friend, Ali Mohammed, the dealer in antiques; that he was unaware of my having divined his bloody secret; and that if I would profit by my accidental discovery, I must continue to feign complete ignorance of it. Turning casually to Ali Mohammed, I was startled to observe the expression upon his usually immobile face: he was positively gray, and I thought I detected a faint rattling sound, apparently produced by his teeth; his eyes were set as if by hypnosis upon the uncleanly figure huddled in the shadow of the low gate. ""You are unwell, my friend,"" I said. Ali Mohammed shook his head feebly, removed his eyes by a palpable effort from the watcher in the gateway, but almost instantly reverted again to that fixed and terrified scrutiny. ""Not at all, Kernaby Pasha,"" he chattered; ""not in the least."" He passed a hand rapidly over a brow wet with perspiration, and moistened his lips, which were correspondingly dry. I determined upon a diplomatic _tour de force_; I looked him squarely in the face. ""For some reason,"" I said distinctly, ""you are in deadly fear of the wall-eyed mendicant who is sitting by the gate of the Sk es-Sagh, O Ali Mohammed, my friend."" I turned with assumed carelessness. The beggar of murderous appearance had vanished, and Ali Mohammed was slowly recovering his composure. I knew that I must act quickly, or he would deny with the urbane mendacity of the Egyptian all knowledge of the one-eyed one; therefore-- ""Acquaint me with the reason of your apprehensions,"" I said, at the same time offering him one of his own cigarettes; ""it may be that I can assist you."" A moment he hesitated, glancing doubtfully in the direction of the gate and back to my face; then-- ""It is one of the people of Tr,"" he whispered, bending close to my ear; ""of the evil _ginn_ who are the creatures of Ab Tabh."" I was puzzled and expressed my doubt in words. ""Alas,"" replied Ali Mohammed, ""the Imm Ab Tabh is neither a man nor an official; he is a magician."" ""Indeed! then you speak of one bearing the curious name of Ab Tabh, who is at once the holder of a holy office and also one who has dealings with the _ginn_ and the _Efreets_. This is strange, Ali Mohammed, my friend."" ""It is strange and terrible,"" he whispered, ""and I fear that my path is beset with pitfalls and slopeth down to desolation."" He pronounced the _Takbr_, ""_Allhu akbar!_"" and uttered the words ""_Hadeed! y mashm!_"" (Iron! thou unlucky!), a potent invocation, as the _ginn's_ dread of that metal is well known. ""There are things of which one may not speak,"" he declared; ""and this is one of them."" Sorely puzzled as I was by this most mysterious happening, yet, because of the pious words of my friend, I knew that the incident was closed so far as confidences were concerned; and I presently took my departure, my mind filled with all sorts of odd conjectures by which I sought to explain the matter. I was used to the superstitions of that quarter where almost every gate and every second street has its guardian _ginnee_, but who and what was Ab Tabh? An Imm, apparently, though to what mosque attached Ali Mohammed had not mentioned. And why did Ali Mohammed fear Ab Tabh? So my thoughts ran, more or less ungoverned, whilst I made my way through streets narrow and tortuous in the direction of the Rondpoint du Mski. I saw no more of the wall-eyed mendicant; but in a court hard by the Mosque of el-Ashraf I found myself in the midst of a squabbling crowd of natives surrounding someone whom I gathered, from the direction of their downward glances, to be prone upon the ground. Since the byways of the Sk el-Attrin are little frequented by Europeans, at midday, I thrust my way into the heart of the throng, thinking that some stray patron of Messrs. Cook and Son (Egypt, Ltd.) might possibly have got into trouble or have been overcome by the heat. Who or what lay at the heart of that gathering I never learned. I was still some distance from the centre of the disturbance when an evil-smelling sack was whipped over my head and shoulders from behind, a hand clapped upon my mouth and jaws; and, lifted in muscular arms, I found myself being borne inarticulate down stone steps, as I gathered from the sound, into some cool cellar-like place. II In my capacity as Egyptian representative of Messrs. Moses, Murphy & Co., of Birmingham, I have sometimes found myself in awkward corners; but in Cairo, whether the native or European quarter, I had hitherto counted myself as safe as in London and safer than in Paris. The unexpectedness of the present outrage would have been sufficient to take my breath away without the agency of the filthy sack, which had apparently contained garlic at some time and",0,0.0
"Eva Olmerová (21 January 1934 – 10 August 1993) was a Czech pop and jazz singer. She is regarded as one of the greatest Czech jazz singers of all time.[1][2] Eva Olmerová was born in Prague in 1934. She started piano lessons at the age of 6, as a pupil of Aurelie Káanová-Bubnová.[1] After World War II her grandparents returned from London, where her grandfather had worked with Edvard Beneš, president of the exiled Czechoslovak government.[3] Her parents divorced in 1948, when she was fourteen. She remained with her father, at his cottage in the village of Třebsín near Štěchovice. While there, she had first-hand experience of the tramping movement and began to sing folk songs with guitar accompaniment. In the early 1950s she became involved in Prague's jazz scene and performed with the Arnošt Kavka Band.[4] In 1951, aged seventeen, she was arrested by the Czechoslovak state security service, in connection with her grandfather's political activities and her uncle Otmar Kučera's wartime service as Commander of 313 Squadron RAF.[5] At the police station she experienced degrading treatment: she was forced to undress, then interrogated. Later, in 1958, she attacked and slapped a policeman and was jailed for fourteen months.[6] In 1952, she married for the first time but was soon divorced. For a while she earned a living as a professional singer in the bars of Prague. In 1962, the composer Karel Mareš offered her an engagement with the Semafor Theatre. Olmerová agreed, but this promising start was sabotaged when her ""criminal past"" was revealed in anonymous letters.[7] Her performance of the Mareš song Jsi jako dlouhý most (""You're Like A Bridge So Long"") won her the Czechoslovak song competition Hledáme písničku pro všední den (""In search of a song for the weekday"").[8] She was otherwise banned from public performance in Prague.[1] Towards the end of 1963 the official restrictions imposed on Olmerová's career were eased. She began a collaboration with the Traditional Jazz Studio, worked occasionally with other music ensembles and was also allowed to perform regularly in the Theatre on the Balustrade, where she met and formed a friendship with Václav Havel, the later Czechoslovak and Czech president.[9] In 1965 she married again. This marriage ended with her husband's emigration after less than a year.[10] Olmerová began to use phenmetrazine in combination with alcohol – she sought psychiatric help but her use of alcohol and drugs would continue to dog her career.[11] In the 1960s she performed in several films and in 1967 returned to the Semafor Theatre. In 1969, she released her first studio album – The Jazz Feeling – with S+HQ and Karel Velebný. It gained wide critical acclaim and Olmerová was invited to perform in Western Europe but the Czechoslovak music agency Pragokoncert, closely tied with the communist authorities, refused her the necessary travel permit due to her ""unreliability"".[12] In 1969 Olmerová may have met the American jazz singer Ella Fitzgerald after Fitzgerald's Prague concert. In this version of events, Ella Fitzgerald was impressed by Olmerová's voice and invited her to join the rest of Fitzgerald's European tour. (Some eyewitnesses question the story.) Olmerová is known to have remained in Prague during Fitzgerald's tour.[13] In 1969 she reunited with Pavel Smetáček and his Traditional Jazz Studio. In 1972 Olmerová married for the third time. This marriage also quickly ended in divorce and in the same year she drunkenly crashed a Wartburg car borrowed from jazz bassist Luděk Hulan. She was arrested and sentenced to ten months in jail.[14] In 1974, she recorded her second album: Eva Olmerová & The Traditional Jazz Studio. Live performances were increasingly problematic, due to her alcoholism.[15] In 1978 she started working with the Prague Big Band and Milan Svoboda. She recorded her next album, Zahraj i pro mne (""Play Also for Me"") with the Jazz Orchestra of the Czechoslovak Radio at the age of 48. It was her first to be sung with Czech lyrics.[1] In 1984, she received the Luděk Hulan Award. In the 1980s Olmerová performed with the Metropolitan Jazz Band, the Steamboat Stompers and with the Senior Dixieland, and occasionally sang with folk and country musicians (Wabi Ryvola among others). In 1986 she recorded the album Dvojčata (""The Twins"") with Jitka Vrbová and Hot Jazz Prague. Her health was rapidly deteriorating, due her alcoholism and associated lifestyle. She lived in poor domestic conditions on a low rate of invalidity pension, but continued singing. From 1989 she performed with what was to be her last regular ensemble, the S-band. Eva Olmerová welcomed the fall of the communist régime in 1989 and visited Václav Havel at Prague Castle, but her health was ruined. Drahomíra Vihanová made a short documentary film about her in 1991 – Proměny přítelkyně Evy (""Changes of Friend Eva""). It generated some harsh critical responses as ""naturalistic"" and ""coarse"".[16] Olmerová wanted to take Vihanová to court, but the Czech director Ivan Vyskočil discouraged her.[17] In her last years, Olmerová performed with the pianist Emil Viklický. During studio rehearsals for her final album, Svíčka a stín (""The Candle and the Shadow"") she collapsed, but as soon as she had been treated at hospital she returned to the studio.[18] Eva Olmerová made her last recording on 26 May 1993, and died on 10 August 1993, in the hospital in Prague-Bubeneč. The primary cause of her death was cirrhosis of the liver. She died childless.[19] In 2006, the Prague municipal government approved naming a street (situated in Prague 15 district) in her honor.[20] Olmerová was an entirely self-taught singer.[21] She claimed to be free of the influences of other singers but admitted to an admiration for Mahalia Jackson and the styles of Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Bing Crosby. She referred to Karel Gott, the most popular singer in Czechoslovakia, as having ""...a homosexual feeble voice with falsetto"".[21] On the Czech jazz scene she was often compared to Bessie Smith and Billie Holiday, both for her voice and her turbulent lifestyle. Czech music critic Jiří Černý compared her",0,0.0
"The University of Michigan Women's Ice Hockey team represents the University of Michigan (U-M) in Women's Division 1 of the American Collegiate Hockey Association (ACHA) and in the Central Collegiate Women's Hockey Association (CCWHA). The team was founded in 1994 and has been consistently strong throughout its existence, winning a pair of CCWHA playoff titles (in a total of ten appearances in the league championship game) and qualifying for 13 of the 18 ACHA National Tournaments held for women's teams, a number that ranks third all-time behind Massachusetts and Michigan State. The Wolverines were co-founded in 1994 by Sue McDowell,[1] who has remained involved with the team in various capacities throughout its existence (although, emphasizing the difficulty of assembling early club hockey records, Michigan State has claimed that its 1995 founding makes it the oldest women's club hockey team in the state of Michigan[2]). McDowell, a Massachusetts native, moved to Michigan in 1985 and took a job in U-M's IT department as a faculty liaison. She was dismayed at the lack of girls hockey in her new home state, leading to her starting the Wolverines' team and becoming heavily involved in local youth programs.[3] In 1996–97, the Central Collegiate Women's Hockey Association was formed (notably pre-dating the women's hockey championships of both the ACHA and NCAA, as well as nearly every other women's college hockey conference), featuring Michigan as one of its charter members and the only team that has participated in each league season to date. The CCWHA provided an unprecedented level of organization and structure to an era when teams often filled out hodgepodge schedules with amateur adult teams and often did not have any sort of championship competition at the end of each season. The Wolverines, along with arch rival Ohio State, were among the most immediately successful teams in the CCWHA. At the inaugural 1997 CCWHA tournament, U-M swept a pool including Western Michigan, Bowling Green and Illinois, then beat Michigan State in the semi-finals, before losing to OSU for the championship.[4] The Buckeyes would go on to win the first three CCWHA titles before moving to NCAA Division I in 1999 and becoming a varsity program. That development would prove beneficial to the Wolverines, who would become the CCWHA's dominant team over the next couple seasons. In 2000–01, U-M smashed their way to a 24–1–1 regular season mark (including an unbeaten conference record, as the team's only defeat was to non-league opponent Arizona State) before defeating hosting Lake Superior State, Michigan State and Western Michigan en route to the CCWHA playoff title. There was plenty of credit to go around for the success: Meghan Collier was the team's leading scorer with 49 goals among her 67 points, Jackie Neal led the way with 24 assists, and goalies Dana Aronson and Christine Granger largely split duties, posting goals against averages of 0.94 and 1.19, respectively.[5] Michigan was a inaugural member of the ACHA's first women's division (initially called the ""Women's Division,"" then ""Women's Division 1"" after a second women's division was added in 2006–07), which began play in that 2000–01 season and received the appropriate national spoils for a strong season. Collier became U-M's initial first team All-American, while the Wolverines received a bid to the ACHA National Tournament after finishing second in the ACHA's East Region (the team placed in the top spot for the first four periods before being edged out by Penn State in the fifth and final regular-season ranking). At nationals, Michigan made history by participating in the opening game of the ACHA's first women's tournament, held in Wentzville, Missouri. Collier scored the first goal in tourney history, although the Wolverines had to settle for a tie with Colorado en route to a disappointing fifth-place finish, thanks largely to a 3–2 loss to Pittsburgh that saw U-M outshoot the Panthers 32–13.[6] Although it turned out to be a two-season blip relative to Michigan's typical success level, the Wolverines struggled during the 2002–03 and 2003–04 seasons, a period that saw the departure of CCWHA-winning coach Hal Krenkel, and the one-year tenure of Steve Wartecker. In 2002–03, despite a strong first half and a fourth straight trip to the conference championship game (a 1–0 loss to Michigan State), the Wolverines dropped from second in the central region to third in the final ranking period to miss the tournament. Under the selection format used at the time, the top two teams in each region were picked for nationals, with two wild cards (generally, the third-ranked team in two of the three regions) rounding out a field of eight. However, for the 2003 tournament, Western Michigan (ranked below Michigan at fifth in the central) received a hosting autobid, limiting things to just one wild card, the west region's St. Cloud State. Despite the senior years of program legends like Collier and Neal, things went from near-miss to far-miss the following season. The 2003–04 schedule saw a disastrous 4–19–2 mark, with three of the four wins coming against a Notre Dame program that was a year away from going on hiatus. Michigan's struggles would prove to be short-lived, thanks largely to new head coach Adam Winters (with Andrea Shear as co-coach during the first half of Winters' tenure) and a bevy of talented reinforcements. Players arriving at U-M in 2003 and 2004 included greats like Megan Lobeck, Lauren Lobert, Laine Schmid, Cheryl Mervich and Hillary Eagen. Jennifer Barnhart provided steady goaltending through the middle part of the decade, including being named the CCWHA's most valuable player in 2004–05, a season that saw her play every minute in the maize and blue crease. In 2004–05, U-M got off to an inauspicious 1–6–1 start thanks in part to a tough schedule including Michigan State and Western Michigan, but the team's fortunes turned on a dime in early November and the Wolverines would only lose a pair of games through the remainder of the regular season, both to a powerful Northern Michigan team that would go on to the ACHA",0,0.0
"The White Knight is one of three Anglo-Norman hereditary knighthoods within Ireland dating from the medieval period.[1] The title was first conferred upon Maurice Fitzgibbon in the early 14th century. The other two knighthoods, both in the Fitzgerald family, are the Knight of Glin (also called the Black Knight), which has become dormant after 700 years (since the death of the 29th Knight, September 2011), and the Knight of Kerry (also called the Green Knight), which is held by Adrian FitzGerald, 6th Baronet, 24th Knight of Kerry. The first White Knight was Maurice FitzGibbon. He was knighted in the field by Edward III in 1333, immediately after the defeat of Scottish forces at the Battle of Halidon Hill.[2][3] Maurice FitzGibbon, 1st White Knight was the son of Gilbert Fitz John, eldest illegitimate son of John FitzGerald, 1st Baron Desmond and Honora, daughter of Hugh O'Connor Don aka Ó Conchubhair Donn of Kerry, King of Connacht aka Felim Ua Conchobair.[4] John FitzGerald was also the ancestor of the Earls of Desmond.[5] The family of the White Knight was esteemed as the second branch of the House of FitzGerald, of which the Earl of Desmond was the head.[6] The following passage discusses a traditional, folk origin of the House of FitzGerald: ""The Fitz Geralds of Ireland, men of approued [sic] valour, were without question / descended from the auncient Trojans, when, that famous citty of Pergamus / beeing vtterly layd waste after ten yeares seidge, all her Princes slayne / in battailes, Prince Aeneas only surviueing; who beeing the close concealement / of Poliscena, Priam’s most beautiful daughter, was banished by the / Greekes, and followed by a gallant and warlike crewe of martiall youths, / who surviued theyre natiue countryes destruction. The Auncestors of Fitz Geralds / were of them who followed him in his exile.""[7] From a fragment of Irish poetry attributed to the Irish poet Donogh McCraith, translated into English: ""Three renowned knights of Gerald’s powerfull [sic] race / In Ireland (well ’twas known), being stoutest had the place; / To distinguish each of these Gallants progenye, / By right of birth and worth, the White Knight bore the sway"".[8] The title of the White Knight, in the original Irish, can be anglicized as: ""Ryther-a-fin"".[9] The White Knight possessed large estates in the counties of Limerick and Cork.[10] Though it was common in the historical context of early medieval Ireland for one possessing Knight's Fees to take his name from the lands that he held by military service,[11] the White Knight was not called after his land, but is supposed to have taken his distinct appellation from the colour of his armour.[12] Maurice Fitzgibbon, 1st White Knight, led military expeditions alongside the Earl of Desmond in Scotland and Wales, serving as Lieutenant-General to the Earl of Desmond.[13] The White Knights were constantly at war with the Lords Roche, their near neighbours. Whenever the followers or retainers of the two families met, except in alliance against a common foe, ""there was sure to be a bloody encounter between them.""[14] One such encounter, between Edmund Fitzgibbon, 11th White Knight, and a bastard son of David Roche, Viscount Roche and Fermoy,[15] is recorded. Roche, attempting to intimidate FitzGibbon into relinquishing claims on the lands of Old Castletown in county Cork, led an incursion into the lands of FitzGibbon, ""where he began to plunder all before him"".[16] As Roche proceeded back toward his own lands, he was intercepted by FitzGibbon.[17] Their encounter is recorded in the following passage: ""At last the Whyte Knight [sic] and Roche fell hand to hand on horseback and fought together, till both theyre staves or horse mobpykes were broaken to shivers. Then they both alighted and fought with theyre swords a good while with equal fortune. At last Roche received a stroake on the knee (for he was armed upwards and ye Whyte Knight had noe armor on him), and Roches men being killed or fledd, one of the Whyte Knight's souldiers came and shott him in ye face with a pocket pistol loaden with small shott, whereupon he fled, and (as it is sayd) would have gone neere to have escaped had it not bin for his bootes, when one Gibbon Roe followed him, being on horseback, and rann him through under the arme pitt, and soe made an end of Stout Roche.""[18] The title passed from father to son for nearly three hundred years. After the death of Edmund Fitzgibbon, 11th White Knight, his land holdings were transmitted to his daughter, Margery, contrary to the ""usual rules of descent of Knight's Fees in Ireland, which would have given it to David Fitzgibbon, of Kilmore, commonly called ne Carrig, (i.e., David of the Rock.).""[20][21] This was allowed due to a special arrangement made by Edmund Fitzgibbon with the English government, ""as one of the conditions of his betraying the Earl of Desmond"".[22] If the estate of Edmund Fitzgibbon had been allowed to pass to David ne Carrig, it would have been confiscated by the English government as a consequence of David ne Carrig's support of the 16th Earl of Desmond in his rebellion against the English.[23] The son of Edmund Fitzgibbon, called Maurice, died the day before his father, in 1608.[24] The title of the White Knight was therefore passed to Maurice's son, who was Edmund's grandson.[25] This was Maurice Oge Fitzgibbon, 12th White Knight, and although he inherited Edmund's ancient title, Edmund's lands passed to Margaret, Edmund's daughter.[26][27] A claim to the title of The White Knight was asserted by Lord Kingston in 1821, who was a descendant by marriage of Margaret (1602–1666), the granddaughter of Edmond Fitzgibbon, 11th White Knight,[28] but was successfully contested and refused by the crown.[29] The last recorded holder of the title of the White Knight was Maurice Fitzgibbon of Crohana, Kilkenny, who assumed the title in 1858.[30] Though the 'Kilkenny' branch of the family has since become extinct, the 'Limerick' branch remains extant.[31] The Fitzgibbons of Limerick represent the last",0,0.0
"some ten miles or so along Broadway, and on the whole I don't blush for my native land. We are a capable race and a good-looking withal; and I don't see why we shouldn't prosper as well as another. This, by the way, ought to be a very encouraging reflection. A capable fellow and a good-looking withal; I don't see why he shouldn't die a millionaire. At all events he must do something. When a man has, at thirty-two, a net income of considerably less than nothing, he can scarcely hope to overtake a fortune before he himself is overtaken by age and philosophy--two deplorable obstructions. I am afraid that one of them has already planted itself in my path. What am I? What do I wish? Whither do I tend? What do I believe? I am constantly beset by these impertinent whisperings. Formerly it was enough that I was Maximus Austin; that I was endowed with a cheerful mind and a good digestion; that one day or another, when I had come to the end, I should return to America and begin at the beginning; that, meanwhile, existence was sweet in--in the Rue Tronchet. But now! Has the sweetness really passed out of life? Have I eaten the plums and left nothing but the bread and milk and corn-starch, or whatever the horrible concoction is?--I had it to-day for dinner. Pleasure, at least, I imagine--pleasure pure and simple, pleasure crude, brutal and vulgar--this poor flimsy delusion has lost all its charm. I shall never again care for certain things--and indeed for certain persons. Of such things, of such persons, I firmly maintain, however, that I was never an enthusiastic votary. It would be more to my credit, I suppose, if I had been. More would be forgiven me if I had loved a little more, if into all my folly and egotism I had put a little more _navet_ and sincerity. Well, I did the best I could, I was at once too bad and too good for it all. At present, it's far enough off; I have put the sea between us; I am stranded. I sit high and dry, scanning the horizon for a friendly sail, or waiting for a high tide to set me afloat. The wave of pleasure has deposited me here in the sand. Shall I owe my rescue to the wave of pain? At moments I feel a kind of longing to expiate my stupid little sins. I see, as through a glass, darkly, the beauty of labor and love. Decidedly, I am willing to work. It's written. 7th.--My sail is in sight; it's at hand; I have all but boarded the vessel. I received this morning a letter from the best man in the world. Here it is: DEAR MAX: I see this very moment, in an old newspaper which had already passed through my hands without yielding up its most precious item, the announcement of your arrival in New York. To think of your having perhaps missed the welcome you had a right to expect from me! Here it is, dear Max--as cordial as you please. When I say I have just read of your arrival, I mean that twenty minutes have elapsed by the clock. These have been spent in conversation with my excellent friend Mr. Sloane--we having taken the liberty of making you the topic. I haven't time to say more about Frederick Sloane than that he is very anxious to make your acquaintance, and that, if your time is not otherwise engaged, he would like you very much to spend a month with him. He is an excellent host, or I shouldn't be here myself. It appears that he knew your mother very intimately, and he has a taste for visiting the amenities of the parents upon the children; the original ground of my own connection with him was that he had been a particular friend of my father. You may have heard your mother speak of him. He is a very strange old fellow, but you will like him. Whether or no you come for his sake, come for mine. Yours always, THEODORE LISLE. Theodore's letter is of course very kind, but it's remarkably obscure. My mother may have had the highest regard for Mr. Sloane, but she never mentioned his name in my hearing. Who is he, what is he, and what is the nature of his relations with Theodore? I shall learn betimes. I have written to Theodore that I gladly accept (I believe I suppressed the ""gladly"" though) his friend's invitation, and that I shall immediately present myself. What can I do that is better? Speaking sordidly, I shall obtain food and lodging while I look about me. I shall have a base of operations. D., it appears, is a long day's journey, but enchanting when you reach it. I am curious to see an enchanting American town. And to stay a month! Mr. Frederick Sloane, whoever you are, _vous faites bien les choses_, and the little that I know of you is very much to your credit. You enjoyed the friendship of my dear mother, you possess the esteem of the virtuous Theodore, you commend yourself to my own affection. At this rate, I shall not grudge it. D--, 14th.--I have been here since Thursday evening--three days. As we rattled up to the tavern in the village, I perceived from the top of the coach, in the twilight, Theodore beneath the porch, scanning the vehicle, with all his amiable disposition in his eyes. He has grown older, of course, in these five years, but less so than I had expected. His is one of those smooth, unwrinkled souls that keep their bodies fair and fresh. As tall as ever, moreover, and as lean and clean. How short and fat and dark and debauched he makes one feel!

"i have an excellent story to tell. but it'm very tired. so it won't be eloquent at all, or really that interetsing since i don't feel like really writing it all. so i was at anna's house, right? and i wasn't gonna go, because they had vodka, but then sean wasn't drinking either. so we were just gonna sit and talk. so sean and i were talking about how stupid drinking is while everyone else proceeded to get drunk. Eli only had a ""shot"" since he was going to go pick up karen at ten. i convinced eli to let me draw on his face with face paint, so he was decorated, and then i colored drew's toenails black. sean and i laughed the delicious laugh of revenge...so in an hour, eli, andrew and i go to get karen. karen was babysitting at her aunt's house, so we had to go get her at some place she didn't really have directions to. we get very lost and andrew has to go to the bathroom. by the way, andrew is very drunk. so we pull into this cemetary parking lot, where andrew hops out of the backseat and runs to the field of death. on his way back to the car, we see headlights. drew yells ""oh my god...the cops are here!"" and leaps back into the car. eli rolls down his window. ""what are you folks doing out here?"" the police officer asks. ""we're going to pick up our friend...do you know where glenwood street is?"" i respond, incredibly nervously. ""yes...can you ask him to step out of the car?"" he gestures towards drew with his flashlight. andrew gets out of the car and walks back towards another police man. ""what was he doing in the graveyard?"" Eli and i both deny having any idea what he was doing. we just got lost on our way to pick up a friend and stopped here to call. ""was he taking a piss?"" the officer suggests. we shrug and confirm his idea with a heartfelt ""i guess so...probably."" the cop goes and joins andrew and his cop partener. Eli and i sit quietly. karen keeps calling andrew's cell phone, which is left in the car. the same police man comes over to my window and gives us directions to glenwood street. i thank him, and he walks about over to andrew and the other man. straining to hear what's going on, the cops ask andrew to empty his pockets. instead of just emptying them, though, andrew goes through each item. ""these are my keys, with my house key and my car key, and they have keychains on it...this is my wallet, it has fun stuff...this is some gum, which is tasty..."" so they ask to see an id. they inform him that it's illegal to be in the graveyard after 10 pm. drew admits to having no knowledge of this law. ""this isn't you. you have green hair. your id says you have dirty blond hair (stupid police laugh). and why are your toenails black?"" andrew and i weren't wearing shoes. eli and i laugh. until the other cop comes. i always thought that the good cop bad cop thing was just in movies. but really, these guys had it down really really well. policeman #2 shines his flashlight in my eyes. ""how much weed is in the car?"" he says, scanning the interior with his light. ""none at all."" eli and i say in unison. i made sure to keep eye contact whenever he asks a question...supposedly they can tell if you're lying by your eye contact. and there wasn't any weed in the car. ""how much weed did you smoke tonight?"" ""none, sir. i'ver never smoked or had a drink in my life."" which is also true. i was still keeping eye contact. ""really?"" ""yes sir."" ""can you stick out your tongue please?"" a seemingly strange request. i stuck my tongue out, and he shined his light on it. drew's phone rang again. ""you can answer it if you want."" bad cop stared at the phone. ""no..that's ok. i'll call back."" so i ignored the call. we hear good cop ask drew to stick out his tongue. ""what are you looking for?"" drew asks, after following their request. ""wiggling."" odd...if you're drunk or high, does your tongue wiggle? good cop comes back over. ""what were you guys doing today? swimming?"" he asks. hmmm...odd question. maybe he's just trying to make small talk while drew is being arrested. swimming, bowling...nope. i thought. my head was so topsy-turvey with nerves. ""no sir...just hanging out around boulder."" ""and you had nothing to smoke."" ""nothing to smoke."" ""hmm...all three of your guys's eyes are bloodshot...it's just a little suspisious. that's why i was asking about if you went swimming."" ""oh no sir...i'm just really, really nervous. i've never been in a car that got pulled over by the cops...so i'm a little jittery, sorry."" ""yeah...me too."" eli spoke. finally. he hadn't talked the rest of the time. good cop asked for your ids (which i didn't have), inspected eli's, and handed it back to him. ""you know, between your crazy friend back there...and now you giving me the finger..."" ""what?!"" eli looked shocked. ""i didn't give you the finger!"" good cop pointed at eli's keychain, which indeed had a finger on it. we both sighed huge sighs of relief, as good cop proceded to laugh at us. he walked back over to the police car. after a few more seconds, andrew got back in the car and good cop told us to sit tight. we sat in total silence, not making any unessecary movements. bad cop came to eli's window. ""get out of back here and go pick up your little friend."" and with that, he walked out of my life. we drove away. andrew immediatly started bashing the laffayette police, before we were even out of the graveyard area.

"Dear [Friend's Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good spirits. I wanted to share a recent experience with you that left me feeling out of place and unhappy. It was an event I attended, and I felt like a fish out of water.

The event was a gala organized by a prominent organization in our city. When I received the invitation, I was excited at the prospect of attending such a prestigious event. However, as soon as I arrived, I couldn't help but feel a wave of discomfort wash over me.

The venue was a magnificent ballroom, elegantly decorated with glistening chandeliers and intricate floral arrangements. As I made my way through the crowd, I couldn't help but notice how well-dressed and polished everyone looked. People were engulfed in conversations, laughter, and exchanging pleasantries. It felt like stepping into a different world, and I instantly felt like an outsider.

I was wearing a simple cocktail dress, nothing too flashy or extravagant. But in comparison to the other attendees, I felt underdressed and inadequate. There were women in exquisite gowns, dripping with diamonds, and men in sharp tailored suits. I felt like my presence paled in comparison to their grandeur.

As I stood on the periphery, observing the interactions around me, I couldn't shake off the feeling of not belonging. Conversation topics ranged from exotic vacations, high-profile job positions, and luxurious lifestyles. It seemed like everyone had a story of success and privilege to share, while I felt like an imposter, hiding my own insecurities.

I tried engaging in small talk with a few people, but I couldn't help but feel that my contributions were trivial and insignificant. It was as if I didn't have a place in this world of opulence and affluence. The more I tried to fit in, the more I felt like an outsider, an intruder into a realm where I didn't belong.

Eventually, I found solace in a quiet corner, away from the crowd, trying to gather my thoughts. It was in that moment of silence that I realized something important. This event was not a reflection of my worth or the value I bring to the world. It was merely a gathering of people who happened to have certain privileges and material possessions.

I reminded myself of the things that truly matter in life - genuine connections, personal growth, and the happiness that comes from within. It wasn't about the exterior trappings of success, but rather the richness of experiences, relationships, and the impact we have on others' lives.

With a renewed perspective, I made the decision to leave the event early. It wasn't worth sacrificing my own happiness and self-worth to try and fit into a world that didn't align with my values. I left with a sense of relief, realizing that true fulfillment comes from embracing who we are and finding contentment in our own unique path.

Sharing this experience with you has been cathartic, my dear friend. It's comforting to confide in someone who understands and accepts me for who I am. I hope you're doing well and I'm looking forward to catching up soon.

Sending you warm regards,

[Your Name]",1,0.0
"I was just watching this movie on ABC Family about this girl who goes to a Music and Dance college, but doesn't know its a classical music school, and at the end, she is close to being kicked out because she isn't very good at classical music, but then she gets really good because she does her best to be just like the girl who is best in the class. But then she realizes that she's not being herself, so at a concert they are performing at, she finishes her classical French song by singing words she and her new hot boyfriend wroteto the same music in English, while dancing- backup dancers included. Now, if she was close to being kicked out before, I can only imagine that that would get her kicked out, despite the roaring applause coming from every one of the professors. But seriously, no one could do that! Though she was very talented... what the heck? We don't even get to see her getting kicked out, because the movie ends as she takes her last bow. Thank you, Britney and Lynn Spears, for producing such a senseless and melodramatic yet thoroughly entertaining movie. I'm starting to take voice lessons again, or at least I'm meeting with a teacher to get started and what not. I'm nervous because she already knew about me before I called her, and I don't want her to have... crazy expectations that I can't live up to. She asked me why it had taken me so long to get back into voice lessons, and I didn't tell her that it was because I was bored with the lessons - she's friends with my old teacher. But I did tell her that it was mostly because I just ran out of time, which is true. I told her that I quit right before ""Cinderella"" my freshman year, but now that I think about it, that's when I quit dance. Oh the things I do for the Hilhi drama department. I told her that I really don't have much time now, but it's important to me, and I know I need it. So anyway, I'm excited, I'm looking forward to improving. Last night was great, with the ice cream and the pot. If you wanna read about it, Jenn's got it all written out in urlLink herblog . It was so much fun, with Jennifer, Newsweek and Time magazine, Chris, ice cream, and crazy men who ""want to get to know Jennifer better"". There is a wedding reception I would like to go to tonight, Annie Price's, actually. She was Aimee's really good friend all through grade school and middle school and stuff, she used to be in our ward for church, but she moved to Canby. I would like to see her younger sister, Katie, who is just a bit younger than me. She always has good looking boys with her, and I'm thinking, wow, she finds good looking guys in Canby. Good girl. She's always been really nice, I see her occasionally. When I was looking through Time magazine with Jennifer last night, I came across two really great articles. First was an interview with Hilary Duff (The Duff, if you will - I saw Amber Gravel at the blood drive a few days ago, and she informed me that that's what people call her these days...haha). Anyway, here's how it went: Time: Do you and your sister Haley wish you were twins so you could make Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen money? Hilary: Umm... no. Haha, ohh dear. The second article was about Mormon actors, one of my favorite being Jon Heder from Napoleon Dynamite. That movie is hilarious! Anyway, the quote they got from him was, ""Dude, it's cool to be Mormon."" I thought that was awesome :). The article was also aboutRyan Gosling, the guy from The Notebook, and Ken Jennings, the guy who's won a record amount of money on Jeopardy. Jennifer let me keep the article :) I'm hungry but there is nothing around my house. I suppose I could get dressed and go buy something, but I'm kind of lazy, and, that would entitle me getting dressed. I told my mom I would water the plants and clean up the mess that was made after cleaning the roof. I should get to that. I called Melody on her birthday, she seems to be having a great time, and it was so refreshing to hear her voice. I told her that I really appreciate how non-dramatic she is, like, I can always count on her to be there for me and I don't have to worry about every little thing ticking her off. I miss her a lot and I can't wait to see her, and I feel bad because if I had more time I would call her more often. Hopefully I will get to call her tomorrow. These are really random thoughts. And a lot of them. Sucks to be anyone who reads this, lol. I know I should be keeping a journal, and I used to, I would write in it every night. I know that keeping a journal is good and what not, but I stopped a while back, and it would take me years to catch up on everything - Aimee getting married, the end of school, college friends leaving, girls camp, dance team, every day stuff. I'm thinking one of these days I'll just type them all out because it's a lot faster and less painful for me to type, and I'll glue them all in my journal or something. Good plan. I also need to clean out all these boxes in my room. During school, my mom decided she wanted to recarpet the house, so I had to put all my stuff in boxes. I started cleaning them out, when my mom told me that she wanted to put wood paneling around the room too. So that was a good 3",0,0.0
"There is something truly magical about the joy of reading and the power of storytelling. As someone who has always been an avid reader, I've found solace, escape, and inspiration within the pages of books. But it wasn't until after college, when I had the freedom to choose my own reading material, that I truly began to appreciate the transformative nature of literature.

One of the most fascinating aspects of reading is the ability to revisit books throughout different stages of our lives. As we grow and change, our perspectives shift, and the stories we once loved take on new meanings. The characters become our friends and mentors, guiding us through the challenges of our own lives. Each time we reread a beloved book, we discover something new, something that speaks to our current experiences and emotions.

One such book that has had a profound impact on me is ""The Red Tent"" by Anita Diamant. This novel tells the story of Dinah, a minor character in the Bible, and her experiences as a woman in ancient times. Through her narrative, Diamant explores themes of female empowerment, spirituality, and the importance of women supporting each other.

When I first read ""The Red Tent,"" I was immediately drawn to Dinah's journey. Her story resonated with me on a deep level, and I couldn't help but feel a strong emotional connection to her character. The way Diamant depicts the relationships between the women in the book, the sense of community and sisterhood, struck a chord within me.

At the time I read the book, I was going through my own struggles with fertility. The process of undergoing fertility treatments can be isolating and emotionally draining. It often feels like a solitary journey, as if you are the only one going through it. But reading ""The Red Tent"" reminded me of the importance of communal support, of women coming together to offer strength and compassion to one another.

In the novel, the women gather in the red tent during their menstrual cycles, and it becomes a sacred space where they share their stories, their joys, and their sorrows. It is a place where they can truly be themselves, free from societal expectations and constraints. This sense of solidarity and sisterhood is something that I deeply longed for during my own fertility journey.

""The Red Tent"" not only provided me with a sense of comfort and understanding, but it also reminded me of the power of storytelling. It made me realize the importance of sharing our own stories, of speaking our truth, and of creating spaces where women can come together to support and uplift each other.

In today's fast-paced and individualistic society, it is easy to forget the power of storytelling and the importance of communal support. We often become so focused on our own lives that we neglect the stories of others, the stories that have the potential to heal, inspire, and connect us.

Reading ""The Red Tent"" was a wake-up call for me, a reminder to pay attention to the forgotten stories, to seek out the narratives that have been marginalized or silenced. It reminded me of the power that lies within each of us to uplift and empower others through our own stories.

So, as I continue my journey as a reader and a storyteller, I carry with me the lessons I've learned from ""The Red Tent."" I strive to be a voice for the untold stories, to create spaces where women can come together and support one another. And I invite you to do the same.

Let us remember and honor the forgotten stories, the narratives that have the power to heal, to inspire, and to connect us. Let us embrace the joy of reading and the power of storytelling, for it is through these acts that we can truly create a more empathetic, compassionate, and supportive world.",1,0.0

"I know it was controversial. I know he spoke for 20 minutes. I know he was loud and boisterous. But I liked it! I liked his passion! Go Al! A text of a speech by Al Sharpton, delivered at the Democratic National Convention Wednesday night, as transcribed by e-Media, Inc.: Thank you. Tonight I want to address my remarks in two parts. One, I'm honored to address the delegates here. Last Friday, I had the experience in Detroit of hearing President George Bush make a speech. And in the speech, he asked certain questions. I hope he's watching tonight. I would like to answer your questions, Mr. President. document.write(' urlLink '); urlLink To the chairman, our delegates, and all that are assembled, we're honored and glad to be here tonight. I'm glad to be joined by supporters and friends from around the country. I'm glad to be joined by my family, Kathy, Dominique, who will be 18, and Ashley. We are here 228 years after right here in Boston we fought to establish the freedoms of America. The first person to die in the Revolutionary War is buried not far from here, a Black man from Barbados, named Crispus Attucks. Forty years ago, in 1964, Fannie Lou Hamer and the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party stood at the Democratic convention in Atlantic City fighting to preserve voting rights for all America and all Democrats, regardless of race or gender. Hamer's stand inspired Dr. King's march in Selma, which brought about the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Twenty years ago, Reverend Jesse Jackson stood at the Democratic National Convention in San Francisco, again, appealing to the preserve those freedoms. Tonight, we stand with those freedoms at risk and our security as citizens in question. I have come here tonight to say, that the only choice we have to preserve our freedoms at this point in history is to elect John Kerry the president of the United States. I stood with both John Kerry and John Edwards on over 30 occasions during the primary season. I not only debated them, I watched them, I observed their deeds, I looked into their eyes. I am convinced that they are men who say what they mean and mean what they say. I'm also convinced that at a time when a vicious spirit in the body politic of this country that attempts to undermine America's freedoms -- our civil rights, and civil liberties -- we must leave this city and go forth and organize this nation for victory for our party and John Kerry and John Edwards in November. And let me quickly say, this is not just about winning an election. It's about preserving the principles on which this very nation was founded. Look at the current view of our nation worldwide as a results of our unilateral foreign policy. We went from unprecedented international support and solidarity on September 12, 2001, to hostility and hatred as we stand here tonight. We can't survive in the world by ourselves. How did we squander this opportunity to unite the world for democracy and to commit to a global fight against hunger and disease? This court has voted five to four on critical issues of women's rights and civil rights. It is frightening to think that the gains of civil and women rights and those movements in the last century could be reversed if this administration is in the White House in these next four years. I suggest to you tonight that if George Bush had selected the court in '54, Clarence Thomas would have never got to law school. This is not about a party. This is about living up to the promise of America. The promise of America says we will guarantee quality education for all children and not spend more money on metal detectors than computers in our schools. The promise of America guarantees health care for all of its citizens and doesn't force seniors to travel to Canada to buy prescription drugs they can't afford here at home. We did it with a go-it-alone foreign policy based on flawed intelligence. We were told that we were going to Iraq because there were weapons of mass destruction. We've lost hundreds of soldiers. We've spent $200 billion dollars at a time when we had record state deficits. And when it became clear that there were no weapons, they changed the premise for the war and said: No, we went because of other reasons. If I told you tonight, Let's leave the Fleet Center, we're in danger, and when you get outside, you ask me, Reverend Al, What is the danger? and I say, It don't matter. We just needed some fresh air, I have misled you and we were misled. We are also faced with the prospect of in the next four years that two or more of the Supreme Court Justice seats will become available. This year we celebrated the anniversary of Brown v. the Board of Education. The promise of America provides that those who work in our health care system can afford to be hospitalized in the very beds they clean up every day. The promise of America is that government does not seek to regulate your behavior in the bedroom, but to guarantee your right to provide food in the kitchen. The issue of government is not to determine who may sleep together in the bedroom, it's to help those that might not be eating in the kitchen. The promise of America that we stand for human rights, whether it's fighting against slavery in the Sudan, where right now Joe Madison and others are fasting, around what is going on in the Sudan; AIDS in Lesotho; a police misconduct in this country.

"Chapter 1: A Chance Encounter

As a foreigner in Egypt, I had always been captivated by the air of mystery and suspense that seemed to permeate the streets of Cairo. From the towering minarets of the mosques to the bustling bazaars filled with exotic spices and trinkets, every corner held the promise of an untold story.

It was on one particularly hot afternoon that I found myself wandering through the labyrinthine streets of the city, seeking respite from the scorching sun. The narrow alleyways were lined with stalls selling everything from colorful scarves to ancient artifacts, and the tantalizing scent of freshly brewed tea wafted through the air.

As I made my way through the crowded streets, I noticed a beggar sitting on the side of the road, his tattered clothes blending seamlessly with the dusty pavement. His face was etched with lines of hardship, and his eyes seemed to hold a secret that I couldn't quite decipher.

Curiosity getting the better of me, I approached the beggar and offered him a few coins. His eyes met mine, and for a moment, I felt a shudder run down my spine. There was something unsettling about his gaze, as if he held a knowledge beyond his humble appearance.

With a raspy voice, he whispered, ""Beware the name of Ab Tabh, for he is a magician of great power and a bringer of misfortune."" Intrigued, I asked for more information, but the beggar simply shook his head and muttered, ""I have said too much already. Go, before it's too late.""

Chapter 2: The Terrified Friend

Puzzled by the beggar's cryptic warning, I couldn't help but share the encounter with my friend, Mahmoud, a local who had grown up in the heart of Cairo. As I recounted the strange encounter, I noticed a flicker of fear in Mahmoud's eyes, a fear that seemed to be rooted in the mere mention of Ab Tabh's name.

Mahmoud, who was usually jovial and fearless, pleaded with me to steer clear of Ab Tabh, warning of the magician's dark powers and his ability to cast spells on unsuspecting victims. He spoke of horrifying tales of people disappearing without a trace after crossing paths with the enigmatic sorcerer.

I dismissed Mahmoud's fears as mere superstition, attributing them to the rich tapestry of Egyptian folklore. But deep down, a part of me couldn't shake off the warning I had received from the beggar. The more I learned about Ab Tabh, the more intrigued I became.

Chapter 3: Into the Abyss

One fateful evening, as I made my way back to my accommodation after a long day of exploring the city, my curiosity got the better of me. I decided to embark on a quest to uncover the truth about Ab Tabh, the mysterious magician who seemed to cast a long shadow over the lives of those who crossed his path.

I followed a series of cryptic clues and directions that had been whispered to me by fellow locals. The trail led me through winding backstreets and dimly lit alleyways until I found myself standing before a nondescript door, devoid of any distinguishing features. With a trembling hand, I knocked.

The door creaked open, revealing a dark, narrow corridor that seemed to stretch endlessly into the abyss. Hesitant but resolute, I stepped inside, my heart racing with a mix of anticipation and fear.

Chapter 4: The Kidnapping

The corridor led me deeper into the bowels of an underground labyrinth, the air growing colder and heavier with each step. The distant sound of dripping water echoed through the tunnels, adding an eerie note to the already oppressive atmosphere.

Suddenly, I felt a sharp blow to the back of my head, and my vision blurred as darkness enveloped me. When I regained consciousness, I found myself confined in a dimly lit, cellar-like room. The walls were damp and covered with moss, and a single flickering bulb cast eerie shadows that danced across the room.

As I struggled to free myself from the ropes that bound my hands, a figure emerged from the shadows. It was none other than Ab Tabh himself, wearing a dark robe and a sinister grin.

""You should not have meddled in my affairs,"" he hissed, his voice dripping with malice. ""Now, you shall pay the price for your curiosity.""

My heart pounded in my chest as Ab Tabh approached me, his eyes gleaming with an unsettling mix of power and malevolence. I knew that my fate now rested in the hands of this mysterious magician, and I braced myself for whatever horrors awaited me in the depths of the cellar.

"Christopher Patrick Gibson (born May 13, 1964) is an American politician, author, professor, college administrator, and former officer in the United States Army. A Republican, Gibson served as the U.S. representative for New York's 20th congressional district from 2011 to 2013 and for New York's 19th congressional district from 2013 to 2017. A lifelong resident of Kinderhook, New York, Gibson joined the United States Army in 1986 after graduating from Siena College.[2] He served tours in the First Gulf War, Kosovo, and Iraq, rising to the rank of colonel. He later taught American politics at West Point and was a national security affairs fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University.[3] He has received four Bronze Stars and a Purple Heart, among other awards while in the military.[4] He also holds a Ph.D. in government from Cornell University. In 2008, he published his first book, Securing the State, which offered his overview on national security decision-making. He retired from the United States Army in 2010 to run for Congress, defeating Democratic incumbent Scott Murphy with 55% of the vote. He was re-elected in 2012 and 2014. In January 2015, Gibson, a supporter of term limits, announced that he would not seek re-election in 2016. Originally seen as a possible candidate for governor in 2018, Gibson announced he would not run. He served as the Stanley Kaplan Distinguished Visiting Professor of American Foreign Policy at Williams College from February 2017 until 2020.[5][6][7] In February 2020, Siena College, Gibson’s alma mater, announced he would be the school’s 12th president becoming the first lay person to lead the Franciscan institution. He immediately went to work as President-Elect and led the college’s COVID Working Group. During his three-year tenure as President, he helped lead the college to record enrollments, balanced budgets, the successful launching of a new strategic plan, new and improved facilities, while earning various national recognitions, including being named among the “top 20” best Catholic Colleges in the U.S. (#9 for 2023) according to the source, College Consensus and listed among Conde Nast’s “50 most beautiful campuses.” He retired from that position on May 31, 2023.[8][9] [10] Gibson was born in Rockville Centre, New York, to Robert and Barbara Gibson. His family moved to Kinderhook, south of Albany, at a young age. He attended Ichabod Crane High School there, where he was a point guard and the co-captain of the basketball team. He then attended Siena College in Loudonville, also near Albany, earning an ROTC Commission and graduating magna cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts in history.[11][12] Upon graduation from Siena, Gibson accepted an active-duty commission with the United States Army as an infantry officer. While in the Army, Gibson ultimately rose to the rank of colonel, serving seven tours including four combat tours in Iraq, Kosovo, the American Southwest in counter-narcotics interdiction, and in 2010 to Haiti after the earthquake. In Haiti, he led the 82nd Airborne Division's 2nd Brigade Combat Team during the first month of the humanitarian effort.[11][3] Throughout his career, Gibson earned a number of military decorations, including a Purple Heart, 4 Bronze Stars, 2 Legions of Merit, the Master Parachutist Badge, the Combat Infantryman's Badge with Star, and the Ranger tab. His units also received awards for their actions in Mosul in support of the first Iraqi national elections his Battalion Task Force earned the Valorous Unit Award. Later in Tal Afar, his battalion and the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment were recognized for excellence by the President of the United States and earned a second Valorous Unit Award.[13][failed verification]. Gibson was selected as the General George C. Marshall Award winner as the top graduate of the United States Army Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth.[citation needed] Gibson earned an MPA, a MA, and a Ph.D. in government, all from Cornell University.[14] He then became a professor of American politics at the United States Military Academy at West Point. He also served as the Stanley Kaplan Distinguished Visiting Professor of American Foreign Policy at Williams College[6] and was a National Security fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University where he wrote a book on Civil-Military relations, Securing the State.[13] Gibson challenged Democratic incumbent Scott Murphy for the 20th Congressional district seat in the House of Representatives and won on November 4, 2010. While there were initially four candidates for the GOP nomination, the other three all dropped their bid, with one of them, Patrick Ziegler, joining Gibson's staff as his campaign manager.[15][16] The uncontested Republican and Conservative candidate, Gibson outraised Murphy in his first full quarter in the campaign, and was a GOP Young Gun.[17][18] A supporter of term limits, Gibson promised to serve no more than four terms. He also called for representatives to be limited to eight years in office, with terms being extended from two years to four, which he called a ""creative way"" to address campaign finance reform without ""impeding"" free speech.[19] Beginning in September, Gibson saw a steady rise in polling numbers: he started behind at 37% compared to Murphy's 54%. However, by October 26, Gibson had risen to 51% and Murphy had fallen to 42%, numbers that more closely reflected the actual outcome.[citation needed] Newsweek described Gibson's win as a combination of running as a Republican in ""perhaps the most conservative [district] in the state""[Note 1] and Murphy having supported ""the two biggest items on Nancy Pelosi's agenda"", regardless of the fact that ""the National Journal had characterized his voting record as one of the 10 most moderate in the House"".[21] Gibson took part in a televised debate with Murphy on October 21, presented by the local PBS station, WMHT.[22] Gibson began the campaign at 17 points behind in the polls but ended up winning the election with 55% of the vote.[23] During his first term, Gibson represented a district that stretched from the outer suburbs of New York City through the Adirondacks and outer Capital District suburbs all the way to Lake Placid.

"Urban morphology is the study of the formation of human settlements and the process of their formation and transformation.[1] The study seeks to understand the spatial structure and character of a metropolitan area, city, town or village by examining the patterns of its component parts and the ownership or control and occupation. Typically, analysis of physical form focuses on street pattern, lot (or, in the UK, plot) pattern and building pattern, sometimes referred to collectively as urban grain.[2][3][4] Analysis of specific settlements is usually undertaken using cartographic sources and the process of development is deduced from comparison of historic maps. Special attention is given to how the physical form of a city changes over time and to how different cities compare to each other. Another significant part of this subfield deals with the study of the social forms which are expressed in the physical layout of a city, and, conversely, how physical form produces or reproduces various social forms. The essence of the idea of morphology was initially expressed in the writings of the great poet and philosopher Goethe (1790). However, the term as such was first used in bioscience. Recently it is being increasingly used in geography, geology, philology and other subject areas. In geography, urban morphology as a particular field of study owes its origins to Lewis Mumford, James Vance and Sam Bass Warner. Peter Hall and Michael Batty of the UK and Serge Salat, France, are also central figures. Urban morphology is considered as the study of urban tissue, or fabric, as a means of discerning the environmental level normally associated with urban design. Tissue comprises coherent neighborhood morphology (open spaces, building) and functions (human activity). Neighborhoods exhibit recognizable patterns in the ordering of buildings, spaces and functions (themes), variations within which nevertheless conform to an organizing set of principles. This approach challenges the common perception of unplanned environments as chaotic or vaguely organic through understanding the structures and processes embedded in urbanisation. Complexity science has provided further explanations showing how urban structures emerge from the uncoordinated action of multiple individuals in highly regular ways.[5] Amongst other things this is associated with permanent energy and material flows to maintain these structures.[6] Urban morphology approaches human settlements as generally unconscious products that emerge over long periods, through the accrual of successive generations of building activity. This leaves traces that serve to structure subsequent building activity and provide opportunities and constraints for city-building processes, such as land subdivision, infrastructure development, or building construction. Articulating and analysing the logic of these traces is the central question of urban morphology. Urban morphology is not generally object-centred, in that it emphasises the relationships between components of the city. To make a parallel with linguistics, the focus is placed on an active vocabulary and its syntax. There is thus a tendency to use morphological techniques to examine the ordinary, non-monumental areas of the city and to stress the process and its structures over any given state or object, therefore going beyond architecture and looking at the entire built landscape and its internal logic. Roger Trancik discusses three major theories of urban spatial design and urban mythology which can guide analysis: Figure and Ground theory is founded on the study of the relationship of land coverage of buildings as solid mass (figure) to open voids (ground) Each urban environment has an existing pattern of solid and voids, and figure and ground approach to spatial design is an attempt to manipulate these relationships by adding to, subtracting from, or changing the physical geometry of the pattern. The objective of these manipulations is to clarify the structure of urban space in a city or district by establishing a hierarchy of spaces of different sizes that are individually enclosed but ordered directionally in relation to each other. Linkage theory focuses on lines formed by streets, pedestrian ways, linear open spaces or other linking elements that physically connect the parts of the city. Place theory operates upon structured systems of human needs and usage.[7] In a broad sense there are three schools of urban morphology: Italian, British, and French. The Italian school centres around the work of Saverio Muratori and dates from the 1940s. Muratori attempted to develop an 'operational history' for the cities he studied (in particular Venice and Rome), which then provided the basis for the integration of new architectural works in the syntax of the urban tissue. Stemming from this view are contributions such as Gianfranco Caniggia's, which conceptualise the city as an organic result of a dynamic procedural typology, which see political-economic forces as shaping a built landscape already conditioned by a particular logic, set of elements, and characteristic processes. The British school centres around the work of M.R.G. Conzen, who developed a technique called 'town-plan analysis.' The key aspects for analysis according to Conzen are: The town plan in turn contains three complexes of plan element: For Conzen, understanding the layering of these aspects and elements through history is the key to comprehending urban form. Followers of Conzen such as J.W.R. Whitehand have examined the ways in which such knowledge can be put to use in the management of historic and contemporary townscapes. The French school, based principally at the Versailles School of Architecture, has generated extensive methodological knowledge for the analysis of urbanisation processes and related architectural models. Much emphasis is placed upon the importance of built space for sustaining social practices; the relationship between the built landscape and the social world is dialectical, with both shaping the other. As an urban-industrial city, Chicago's socio-economic problems were obvious and crying out to be studied in depth. Therefore, several urban sociologists and geographers belonging to the so-called Chicago School, such as W.I. Thomas (concerned with migration), Robert E Park and Ernest Burgess, attempted to analyse the morphology of Chicago in order to solve these problems. Burgess employed an ecological approach in placing emphasis on the relationship between organisms and their environment. He used similar biological factors used in explaining plant distribution and established",0,0.0
"Father Wolf. “It is time to hunt again.” He was going to spring down hill when a little shadow with a bushy tail crossed the threshold and whined: “Good luck go with you, O Chief of the Wolves. And good luck and strong white teeth go with noble children that they may never forget the hungry in this world.” It was the jackal--Tabaqui, the Dish-licker--and the wolves of India despise Tabaqui because he runs about making mischief, and telling tales, and eating rags and pieces of leather from the village rubbish-heaps. But they are afraid of him too, because Tabaqui, more than anyone else in the jungle, is apt to go mad, and then he forgets that he was ever afraid of anyone, and runs through the forest biting everything in his way. Even the tiger runs and hides when little Tabaqui goes mad, for madness is the most disgraceful thing that can overtake a wild creature. We call it hydrophobia, but they call it dewanee--the madness--and run. “Enter, then, and look,” said Father Wolf stiffly, “but there is no food here.” “For a wolf, no,” said Tabaqui, “but for so mean a person as myself a dry bone is a good feast. Who are we, the Gidur-log [the jackal people], to pick and choose?” He scuttled to the back of the cave, where he found the bone of a buck with some meat on it, and sat cracking the end merrily. “All thanks for this good meal,” he said, licking his lips. “How beautiful are the noble children! How large are their eyes! And so young too! Indeed, indeed, I might have remembered that the children of kings are men from the beginning.” Now, Tabaqui knew as well as anyone else that there is nothing so unlucky as to compliment children to their faces. It pleased him to see Mother and Father Wolf look uncomfortable. Tabaqui sat still, rejoicing in the mischief that he had made, and then he said spitefully: “Shere Khan, the Big One, has shifted his hunting grounds. He will hunt among these hills for the next moon, so he has told me.” Shere Khan was the tiger who lived near the Waingunga River, twenty miles away. “He has no right!” Father Wolf began angrily--“By the Law of the Jungle he has no right to change his quarters without due warning. He will frighten every head of game within ten miles, and I--I have to kill for two, these days.” “His mother did not call him Lungri [the Lame One] for nothing,” said Mother Wolf quietly. “He has been lame in one foot from his birth. That is why he has only killed cattle. Now the villagers of the Waingunga are angry with him, and he has come here to make our villagers angry. They will scour the jungle for him when he is far away, and we and our children must run when the grass is set alight. Indeed, we are very grateful to Shere Khan!” “Shall I tell him of your gratitude?” said Tabaqui. “Out!” snapped Father Wolf. “Out and hunt with thy master. Thou hast done harm enough for one night.” “I go,” said Tabaqui quietly. “Ye can hear Shere Khan below in the thickets. I might have saved myself the message.” Father Wolf listened, and below in the valley that ran down to a little river he heard the dry, angry, snarly, singsong whine of a tiger who has caught nothing and does not care if all the jungle knows it. “The fool!” said Father Wolf. “To begin a night’s work with that noise! Does he think that our buck are like his fat Waingunga bullocks?” “H’sh. It is neither bullock nor buck he hunts to-night,” said Mother Wolf. “It is Man.” The whine had changed to a sort of humming purr that seemed to come from every quarter of the compass. It was the noise that bewilders woodcutters and gypsies sleeping in the open, and makes them run sometimes into the very mouth of the tiger. “Man!” said Father Wolf, showing all his white teeth. “Faugh! Are there not enough beetles and frogs in the tanks that he must eat Man, and on our ground too!” The Law of the Jungle, which never orders anything without a reason, forbids every beast to eat Man except when he is killing to show his children how to kill, and then he must hunt outside the hunting grounds of his pack or tribe. The real reason for this is that man-killing means, sooner or later, the arrival of white men on elephants, with guns, and hundreds of brown men with gongs and rockets and torches. Then everybody in the jungle suffers. The reason the beasts give among themselves is that Man is the weakest and most defenseless of all living things, and it is unsportsmanlike to touch him. They say too--and it is true--that man-eaters become mangy, and lose their teeth. The purr grew louder, and ended in the full-throated “Aaarh!” of the tiger’s charge. Then there was a howl--an untigerish howl--from Shere Khan. “He has missed,” said Mother Wolf. “What is it?” Father Wolf ran out a few paces and heard Shere Khan muttering and mumbling savagely as he tumbled about in the scrub. “The fool has had no more sense than to jump at a woodcutter’s campfire, and has burned his feet,” said Father Wolf with a grunt. “Tabaqui is with him.” “Something is coming uphill,” said Mother Wolf, twitching one ear. “Get ready.” The bushes rustled a little in the thicket, and Father Wolf dropped with his haunches under him, ready for his leap. Then, if you had been watching, you would have seen the most wonderful thing in the world--the wolf checked in mid-spring. He made his bound before he saw what it was he was jumping at, and then he tried to stop himself. The result was that he shot up straight into the air for four or five",0,0.0
"The 2023–24 Coupe de France preliminary rounds make up the qualifying competition to decide which teams take part in the main competition from the seventh round. This is the 107th season of the main football cup competition of France. The competition is organised by the French Football Federation (FFF) and is open to all clubs in French football, as well as clubs from the overseas departments and territories (Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique, Mayotte, New Caledonia, Tahiti, Réunion, Saint Martin, and Saint Pierre and Miquelon). The six (or more, if required) preliminary rounds are organised by the 13 Regional leagues from the mainland, and the 6 Regional leagues of the overseas departments and territories. They take place between May and November 2023. Although all mainland regions follow a set schedule from the third round, regions are allowed to set their own schedules for earlier rounds, including any preliminaries required. The general schedule published by the FFF saw all rounds return to their usual dates, after changes last season due to the 2022 FIFA World Cup.[1] The Paris-Île-de-France league chose to hold their early rounds at the end of the 2022–23 season, rather the normal August dates.[2] Overseas territories organise their own qualifying tournaments, aligning with entry into the main tournament at the seventh round. The details of the qualifying rounds for each league is separated out to individual articles, to avoid this article being too lengthy. A total of eleven clubs will qualify from the overseas leagues, two each from Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique, Réunion, and one each from Mayotte, New Caledonia and Tahiti.[3] In 2022–23, La Tamponnaise from Réunion made it to the round of 64, losing to RC Grasse 1–0 on the mainland.[4] On 9 May 2023, the Mayotte league announced that 85 teams had entered the competition, of which 39 teams from the lowest division, Régionale 4, had been included in the draw for the tour de cadrage (framing round), with one team given a bye.[5] The second round draw was published on 30 May 2023, with the teams from the second and third tier divisions joining. 25 ties were drawn, and four teams were given byes.[6] For this season, the Réunion league designated that entrants would be the teams from Régionale 1 and two teams chosen from Super 2, totalling 16 teams.[7] The first draw for teams in the Réunion league, titled as the second round in line with the mainland competition, was published on 11 May 2023.[8] Competition in French Guiana is expected to start in August 2023. Competition in Martinique is expected to start in August 2023. Competition in Guadeloupe is expected to start in August 2023. The Overseas Collectivity of Saint Pierre and Miquelon has only three teams, so there is just one match in each of two rounds, with one team receiving a bye to the second round. Lots were drawn to decide which teams would receive the bye.[9] A total of fourteen teams will qualify from the Nouvelle-Aquitaine preliminary rounds.[3] Qualifying starts in August 2023. In 2022–23, four teams from the region progressed to the 8th round, but all were eliminated at that stage. Fourth tier Bergerac Périgord FC and Trélissac FC were defeated by Ligue 2 sides Niort and Bordeaux respectively; fifth tier US Lège Cap Ferret lost to third tier LB Châteauroux and fifth tier SO Châtellerault lost to Avoine OCC from the same division.[10][11][12][13] A total of eleven teams will qualify from the Pays de la Loire preliminary rounds.[3] Qualifying starts in August 2023. In 2022–23, Les Herbiers VF progressed furthest in the main competition, reaching the round of 32, where they lost to Stade de Reims.[14] A total of six teams will qualify from the Centre-Val de Loire preliminary rounds.[3] Qualifying starts in August 2023. In 2022–23, Vierzon FC were the last amateur team in the main competition, reaching the round of 16, where they were narrowly beaten by Grenoble.[15] Two teams will qualify from the Corsica preliminary rounds.[3] Qualifying starts in September 2023. In 2022–23, both qualifying teams, FC Borgo and GC Lucciana were eliminated at the seventh-round stage. FC Borgo lost 3–0 at Nîmes.[16] GC Lucciana lost by a single goal to JA Drancy from the same division.[17] Qualifying starts in August 2023. A total of nine teams will qualify from the Bourgogne-Franche-Comté preliminary rounds.[3] In 2022–23, ASM Belfort progressed the furthest in the competition, reaching the round of 32, where they were beaten by Annecy FC on penalties, in a game which ended with fighting between the players of both sides.[18] On 13 June 2023, the league announced that 404 teams had entered from the region.[19] The draw for the first round was published on the same day, featuring 298 teams from the district level divisions, and from Régional 3. The remaining 24 Régional 3 teams were given a bye to the second round.[20] A total of twenty teams will qualify from the Grand Est preliminary rounds.[3] Qualifying starts in August 2023. In 2022–23, ES Thaon and FCO Strasbourg Koenigshoffen 06 progressed furthest in the competition, reaching the round of 32. The tier six side from Strasbourg were one of the last two remaining sides in the competition from outside the national league structure, but were eventually knocked out by a single goal against Ligue 1 side Angers in front of more than 18,000 fans at Stade de la Meinau.[21] Thaon lost on penalties to defending champions Nantes after a goal-less tie.[22] On 24 July 2023, the league published the details of the dates and number of fixtures for the rounds under their organisation. A total of 935 entered from the region, with district level teams and 44 Régional 3 teams entering at the first round stage, making up a total of 360 fixtures. The remaining Régional 3 and all Régional 2 teams (a total of 160 teams) would enter at the second round stage. Régional 1 teams and Championnat National 3 teams (a total of 46 teams) would enter at the third round stage.",0,0.0
"Africa is often considered and referred as the ""Sun continent"" or the continent where the Sun's influence is the greatest.[2] According to the ""World Sunshine Map"", Africa receives many more hours of bright sunshine during the course of the year than any other continent of the Earth:[3] and many of the sunniest countries on the planet are in Africa.[4] Despite the large solar potential, penetration of solar power in Africa's energy sector is still very low.[5] The whole continent has a long duration of sunshine, and excluding the large areas of tropical rainforests (the Guinean Forests of West Africa and much of the Congo Basin), as the desert and savannah regions of Africa represent Earth's largest cloud-free area.[6] Africa is dominated by clear skies even beyond deserts (ex : Sahara, Namib, Kalahari),[7] however, the regions located along the equator are considerably cloudier than the tropics and subtropics. The eastern Sahara/northeastern Africa is particularly noted for its world sunshine records. The area experiences some of the greatest mean annual duration of bright sunshine,[8] with the sun shining brightly for approximatively 4,300 hours a year,[9] equivalent to 97% of the possible total.[10] This region also has the highest mean annual values of solar radiation[11][12] (the maximum recorded being over 220 kcal/cm2[13]). The low latitude of the landmass is another asset: much of the continent lies in the intertropical zone, where the intensity and the strength of the sunlight are always high. The area contains lots of vast sun-drenched arid and semi-arid expanses in the north, in the south, and to a lesser extent in the east. About two fifths of the continent are desert, and thus continuously sunny. The combination of all these geographical and climatic factors is the cause of the large solar potential of Africa. The number of days of sunlight allows the potential of bringing solar power to much of Africa without large scale grid infrastructure.[14] The distribution of solar resources across Africa is fairly uniform, with more than 85% of the continent's landscape receiving a global solar horizontal irradiation at or over 2,000 kWh/(m2 year).[15][16][17] Also, the theoretical reserves of Africa's solar energy are estimated at 60,000,000 TWh/year, which accounts for almost 40% of the global total, thus making Africa the most sun-rich continent in the world.[18] Pay-as-you-go Solar System offers credit to poorer customers in rural Africa, thereby allowing them to invest in infrastructure for their homes. The most consistent approach to tackling this huge obstacle to development has come with the off-grid pay-as-you-go solar power model, now called PayGo, which in some countries such as Malawi where a company called Yellow[19] is electrifying the population faster than grid electricity. PayGo system leverage the technologies of Mobile money to receive payments from their customers allowing them to pay from rural locations without a smartphone or access to internet. Declining solar equipment costs were expected to significantly increase solar installations in Africa with an industry projection forecasting that the continent's annual PV market would expand to 2.2 GW by 2018.[20] Future installations for harvesting solar energy in Africa will tend not to be found within the equatorial and subequatorial climate zones, that are located in the western part of Central Africa usually near the equator but that extend as far north and south as the 8th or 9th parallel in both hemispheres, since they are systematically linked with almost permanent cloud cover and only intermittent bright sunshine. Therefore, countries that entirely lie in this wet-humid zone such as the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Senegal[21] are by far the least favoured in solar power of all the continent and except for these eight quoted nations, each other African country experiences over 2,700 hours of bright sunshine on at least a part of its territory. Many perpetually sunny African nations like Egypt, Libya, Algeria, Niger, Sudan, South Africa, Botswana and Namibia for instance could rely on developing their tremendous solar resources on a large scale thanks to the immense surface of their territory and at reduced prices. South Africa is a leader in solar power in Africa with 1329 MW installed by 2016.[22] Solar power in South Africa is rapidly growing. Several 75 MW PV plants and 2 CSP plants at 100 MW each were the largest in the country and among the largest in Africa. South Africa has announced a plan to install a minigrid on Robben Island; adding PV and battery storage is predicted by reduce diesel usage by half.[23] A 50 MW photovoltaic power plant is planned for Garissa in Kenya, a city located at the equator where the sun is said to shine for about 3,144 hours each year on average, and it is expected to produce approximately 76,473 MWh/year.[24] A 155 MW photovoltaic power plant is planned for Ghana and the government plans to increase solar power in the country from 22.5MW in 2017 to 300MW in 2020.[25][26] There are also many small-scale modular solar power installations being implemented across the continent at the village and household levels.[27] In 2015, Sub-Saharan Africa was the leading region for purchases of off-grid solar products.[28] The Kingdom of Morocco’s solar plan, which is one of the world’s largest solar energy projects and estimated to cost about $9 billion, was introduced in November 2009 with the aim of establishing 2,000 MW of solar power by 2020. Five sites have been selected for the development of solar power plants combining a number of technologies including concentrated solar power, parabolic trough as well as photovoltaics, with the 500MW phase one solar power complex at Ouarzazate being the first to be developed.[32][33][34] The first part of the 500MW project, the 160MW Noor I came online in 2016 and uses parabolic trough concentrated solar power technology.[35] Morocco, the only African country to have a power cable link to Europe, aims to benefit from energy sales to Europe. One such initiative was Desertec.[36] South Africa has developed several solar thermal plants, both parabolic trough",0,0.0
"As I sit here, staring at my reflection in the mirror, I can't help but feel a wave of insecurity wash over me. The endless barrage of images portraying perfect bodies in the media has taken its toll on my self-esteem. Society's expectations of what I should look like seem impossible to meet, and it's a constant battle between what I see in the mirror and what I think I should look like.

Growing up, I was always aware of my body. The comments from family and friends about weight and appearance were like a constant soundtrack playing in the background of my life. I internalized those words, letting them shape my perception of myself. I remember feeling self-conscious whenever I had to pick out an outfit, constantly worrying about how it would make me look. Fitting into society's narrow definition of beauty became my ultimate goal, overshadowing any other qualities I possessed.

But as I've gotten older, I've come to realize that there is so much more to me than just my appearance. I am more than just the sum of my physical attributes. I have talents, dreams, and a personality that goes far beyond my cellulite or the size of my waist.

It's a struggle to break free from the societal beauty standards that have been ingrained in me since childhood. People constantly tell me to love myself as I am, but it's easier said than done. The pressure to conform to certain body types and sizes is everywhere, from billboards to social media. It's as if society has decided that only one kind of body is acceptable, and any deviation from that is deemed unworthy.

But who gets to decide what is beautiful? Who gets to dictate how we should look? I've come to realize that beauty is subjective, and it's up to me to define what is beautiful in my own eyes. I don't owe anyone a perfectly sculpted body or flawless skin. I owe it to myself to be happy and comfortable in my own skin, regardless of what others might think.

Accepting my body has been a journey of self-discovery. I've had to challenge the negative thoughts that have been so deeply ingrained within me. I've had to learn to be kind to myself, to appreciate all the things my body allows me to do, rather than focusing on its flaws. It's not always easy, but I'm slowly learning to love the skin I'm in.

It's not just about body size or physical appearance; it's about embracing my uniqueness. I've realized that my worth is not contingent upon meeting society's beauty standards, but rather on the love and kindness I show myself and others. It's about celebrating the things that make me different and learning to appreciate the beauty in diversity.

I've also discovered the importance of surrounding myself with a supportive community. Connecting with people who uplift and empower me has been instrumental in my journey towards self-acceptance. Sharing stories and experiences with others who have faced similar struggles has helped me realize that I am not alone. Together, we can challenge societal norms and redefine what it means to be beautiful.

So, as I look at myself in the mirror now, I see more than just my flaws. I see a person who has fought battles, overcome obstacles, and grown stronger. I see a person who is worthy of love and acceptance, just as they are. It's not about striving for some unattainable ideal; it's about embracing my uniqueness and celebrating all that makes me who I am.

In a world that tries to make us believe that we are not enough, choosing self-acceptance is an act of rebellion. It's reclaiming our power and refusing to let society's expectations define us. So, here's to embracing our bodies, embracing our selves, and rewriting the narrative of beauty and self-worth. We are so much more than our physical appearances, and it's time we start truly believing that.",1,0.0
"Vera Louise Holme was a remarkable British actress and suffragette who made significant contributions to the women's rights movement in the early 20th century. Born in 1891 in Salford, England, she grew up in a middle-class family and developed a passion for acting from a young age.

Holme began her career in the theater, honing her skills and gaining recognition for her talent. With her captivating performances and dedication to her craft, she quickly made a name for herself in the acting world. She appeared in numerous productions, both in London's West End and on tour across the United Kingdom.

However, Holme's passion for women's rights soon began to rival her love for the stage. Inspired by the suffrage movement, she joined the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), led by Emmeline Pankhurst and her daughters, Christabel and Sylvia. Holme was no ordinary suffragette; she became an integral part of the Pankhurst family's activities, serving as their chauffeur.

As a chauffeur, Holme played a crucial role in assisting the Pankhursts with their political campaigns. She transported them to various meetings, rallies, and demonstrations, ensuring their safety and making it possible for them to carry out their activism. Holme's position as the Pankhursts' driver also gave her firsthand experience of the challenges faced by suffragettes and the repression they often encountered.

Holme's involvement in the suffrage movement became even more profound during the infamous ""Black Friday"" protest in 1910. On this day, suffragettes, including Holme, peacefully marched to Parliament to demand the right to vote. However, they were met with brutality from the police, resulting in numerous injuries and arrests. Holme was among those arrested and spent time in prison, enduring the hardships that many suffragettes faced.

Despite her commitment to suffrage, Holme continued to pursue her acting career. She appeared in many notable plays and even had a brief foray into silent films, showcasing her versatile talent. Her success in the entertainment industry allowed her to use her platform to advocate for women's rights, raising awareness and support for the suffrage cause.

When World War I erupted in 1914, Holme's dedication to the cause took a different form. She joined the Voluntary Aid Detachment (VAD) and became an ambulance driver, serving on the front lines in France. Her bravery and resilience in a male-dominated field were commendable, as she navigated the dangers of war to help wounded soldiers.

After the war, Holme continued to be active in the women's movement. She became involved in the Women's Institute, an organization that empowered rural women and promoted their economic and social development. Holme's contributions to the Women's Institute helped to improve the lives of countless women and demonstrate that suffrage was only the beginning of the fight for women's equality.

In addition to her activism and successful acting career, Holme's personal life deserves recognition. She embraced her lesbian identity, forming romantic relationships with other women, including the playwright and novelist Elizabeth Robins. In an era when homosexuality was heavily stigmatized, Holme's openness and courage provide a glimpse into the lives of lesbian women during the interwar period.

Vera Louise Holme's legacy as an actress, suffragette, and female pioneer is a testament to her determination and commitment to women's rights. Her multifaceted life serves as an inspiration to future generations, showcasing the power of combining one's passions with a cause greater than oneself. Holme's contributions to both the arts and the women's movement solidify her place in history as a true trailblazer.",1,0.0
"Working for a struggling newspaper is truly a gig for the ages. Every day is a new adventure filled with excitement, frustration, and a healthy dose of sarcasm. Welcome to the world of The Billow, where overworked and underpaid writers are the norm and the coffee flows freely to make up for the lack of funds.

Let me introduce myself. I am, or rather, was, a writer for this illustrious establishment. My days were filled with the daunting task of churning out articles that no one would read and covering events that no one cared about. It's a struggle, my friends, a struggle that could make even the most hardened of journalists shed a tear.

But oh, the adventures I had. My boss, O'Hara, had a way of persuading me to take on tasks that were beyond my pay grade. One day, he convinced me that I should start writing a column. Now, I know what you're thinking - columns are the holy grail of journalism. But let me tell you, when you're writing for a failing newspaper, your column is about as popular as a lecture on quantum physics at a kindergarten.

And then there was the time when O'Hara decided to downsize the company. Guess who got the lucky job of firing staff? Yours truly, the struggling writer who was barely scraping by on ramen noodles and the occasional free sandwich from the local deli. I can still see the faces of my colleagues as I delivered the news. The mix of shock, anger, and relief was almost too much for me to bear.

But perhaps the zenith of my career at The Billow was when O'Hara decided that we needed to cover the Klondike gold rush. Yes, you heard me right. A struggling newspaper, with barely enough money to refill the coffee machine, was going to send its intrepid reporter to the land of gold and adventure. Never mind that I was more suited for typing away behind a desk than braving the elements and digging for treasure. It was an offer I couldn't refuse, or rather, couldn't afford to refuse.

So off I went, armed with a pen, a notepad, and a sense of impending doom. I trudged through the snow, battling frostbite and a complete lack of journalistic skills. The locals didn't take kindly to a city slicker like me, stumbling around their territory with a notebook in hand. But I persevered, because that's what a struggling writer does. We persevere, no matter the odds.

And when I finally returned to the comforting embrace of The Billow's crumbling office, I realized that despite the struggles, the frustrations, and the complete lack of appreciation, I still loved my job. There was something magical about putting words to paper, about uncovering stories that would otherwise go untold. Sure, the pay was laughable and the hours were brutal, but I wouldn't have traded it for anything.

So here I am, a struggling writer in a struggling newspaper, armed with a cup of lukewarm coffee and a sense of humor. Because at the end of the day, what else is there to do but laugh at the absurdity of it all? The Billow may be on its last legs, but as long as there are stories to be told, there will always be a writer willing to tell them. And that writer, my friends, is me.",1,0.0
"short minute he sat, tense, his body stiffened by the agony that rode it--unable to move a muscle. I watched the torment in his eyes build up to a crescendo of pain, until the suffering became so great that it filmed his eyes, and I knew that, though he still stared directly at me, he no longer saw me. Then, as suddenly as the spasm had come, the starch went out of his body and his back slid slowly down the chair edge. He landed heavily with his head resting limply against the seat of the chair. His right leg doubled up in a kind of jerk, before he was still. I knew the time had come. ""Where are you?"" I asked. This moment had cost me sixty thousand dollars. Three weeks ago the best doctors in the state had given me a month to live. And with seven million dollars in the bank I couldn't buy a minute more. I accepted the doctors' decision philosophically, like the gambler that I am. But I had a plan: One which necessity had never forced me to use until now. Several years before I had read an article about the medicine men of a certain tribe of aborigines living in the jungles at the source of the Amazon River. They had discovered a process in which the juice of a certain bush--known only to them--could be used to poison a man. Anyone subjected to this poison died, but for a few minutes after the life left his body the medicine men could still converse with him. The subject, though ostensibly and actually dead, answered the medicine men's every question. This was their primitive, though reportedly effective method of catching glimpses of what lay in the world of death. [Illustration] I had conceived my idea at the time I read the article, but I had never had the need to use it--until the doctors gave me a month to live. Then I spent my sixty thousand dollars, and three weeks later I held in my hands a small bottle of the witch doctors' fluid. The next step was to secure my victim--my collaborator, I preferred to call him. The man I chose was a nobody. A homeless, friendless non-entity, picked up off the street. He had once been an educated man. But now he was only a bum, and when he died he'd never be missed. A perfect man for my experiment. I'm a rich man because I have a system. The system is simple: I never make a move until I know exactly where that move will lead me. My field of operations is the stock market. I spend money unstintingly to secure the information I need before I take each step. I hire the best investigators, bribe employees and persons in position to give me the information I want, and only when I am as certain as humanly possible that I cannot be wrong do I move. And the system never fails. Seven million dollars in the bank is proof of that. Now, knowing that I could not live, I intended to make the system work for me one last time before I died. I'm a firm believer in the adage that any situation can be whipped, given prior knowledge of its coming--and, of course, its attendant circumstances. * * * * * For a moment he did not answer and I began to fear that my experiment had failed. ""Where are you?"" I repeated, louder and sharper this time. The small muscles about his eyes puckered with an unnormal tension while the rest of his face held its death frost. Slowly, slowly, unnaturally--as though energized by some hyper-rational power--his lips and tongue moved. The words he spoke were clear. ""I am in a ... a ... tunnel,"" he said. ""It is lighted, dimly, but there is nothing for me to see."" Blue veins showed through the flesh of his cheeks like watermarks on translucent paper. He paused and I urged, ""Go on."" ""I am alone,"" he said. ""The realities I knew no longer exist, and I am damp and cold. All about me is a sense of gloom and dejection. It is an apprehension--an emanation--so deep and real as to be almost a tangible thing. The walls to either side of me seem to be formed, not of substance, but rather of the soundless cries of melancholy of spirits I cannot see. ""I am waiting, waiting in the gloom for something which will come to me. That need to wait is an innate part of my being and I have no thought of questioning it."" His voice died again. ""What are you waiting for?"" I asked. ""I do not know,"" he said, his voice dreary with the despair of centuries of hopelessness. ""I only know that I must wait--that compulsion is greater than my strength to combat."" The tone of his voice changed slightly. ""The tunnel about me is widening and now the walls have receded into invisibility. The tunnel has become a plain, but the plain is as desolate, as forlorn and dreary as was the tunnel, and still I stand and wait. How long must this go on?"" He fell silent again, and I was about to prompt him with another question--I could not afford to let the time run out in long silences--but abruptly the muscles about his eyes tightened and subtly a new aspect replaced their hopeless dejection. Now they expressed a black, bottomless terror. For a moment I marveled that so small a portion of a facial anatomy could express such horror. ""There is something coming toward me,"" he said. ""A--beast--of brutish foulness! Beast is too inadequate a term to describe it, but I know no words to tell its form. It is an intangible and evasive--thing--but very real. And it is coming closer! It has no organs of sight as I know them, but I feel that it can see me. Or rather that",0,0.0

PAGE & COMPANY (INCORPORATED) _All rights reserved_ First impression, October, 1911 _Electrotyped and Printed by THE COLONIAL PRESS C. H. Simonds & Co., Boston. U. S. A._ Foreword OF all the elements that go to make up a good story,--plot, verisimilitude, happy incident, local colour, excellent style,--none perhaps is more important than the touch of understanding sympathy. The writer must not only see his characters clearly and draw them with a masterly hand; he must have the largeness of heart that can share in all the turbulent experience of the human spirit. His people must be set against the vast shifting background of destiny. He must show their dramatic relations, one to another, and the influence of life upon life; he must also show their profounder, more moving and mysterious, relations to fate and time and the infinite things. The writer of fiction creates for us a mimic country, peoples it with creatures of the fancy, like ourselves and yet different, and asks us to stray for our entertainment through that new kingdom. The scenes may be as strange or as familiar as you please; the characters as commonplace or as exceptional as you will; yet they must always be within the range of our sympathy. The incidents must be such as we ourselves could pass through; the people must be such as we can understand. They may well be exceptional, for that enlists our interest and enlivens our curiosity; they must not be beyond our comprehension nor outside our spiritual pale, for then we could have no sympathy with them, and our hearts would only grow cold as we read. And what is at the base of our sympathy and interest? Nothing but our common life. They, too,--all the glad or sorrowing children of imaginative literature from Helen of Troy to Helena Richie--are travelers like ourselves on the great highway. We know well how difficult a road it is, how rough, how steep, how dangerous, how boggy, how lined with pitfalls, how bordered with gardens of deadly delights, how beset by bandits, how noisy with fakirs, how overhung with poisonous fruit and swept by devastating storms. We know also what stretches of happiness are there, what days of friendship, what hours of love, what sane enjoyment, what rapturous content. How should we not, then, be interested in all that goes by upon that great road? We like to sit at our comfortable windows, when the fire is alight or the summer air is soft, and ""watch the pass,"" as they say in Nantucket,--what our neighbours are about, and what strangers are in town. If we live in a small community, there is the monotony of our daily routine to be relieved. When an unknown figure passes down the street, we may enjoy the harmless excitement of novelty and taste something of the keen savour of adventure. If we are dwellers in a great city, where every passer is unknown, there is still the discoverer's zest in larger measure; every moment is great with possibility; every face in the throng holds its secret; every figure is eloquent of human drama. The pageant is endless, its story never finished. Who, indeed, could not be spellbound, beholding that countless changing tatterdemalion caravan go by? Yet all we may hope for of the inner history of these journeying beings, so humanly amazing, so significant, and all moved like ourselves by springs of joy and fear, hope and discouragement, is a glimpse here and there, a life-story revealed in a single gesture, a tragic history betrayed in the tone of a voice or the lifting of a hand, or perhaps a heaven of gladness in a glancing smile. For the most part their orbits are as aloof from us as the courses of the stars, potent and mystic manifestations of the divine, glowing puppets of the eternal masked in a veil of flesh. This was the pomp of history which held the mind of Shakespeare, of Dickens, of Cervantes, of Balzac, in thrall, and drew the inquiring eye of Browning and Whitman, of Stevenson and Borrow, with so charmed and comprehending a look. To understand and set down faithfully some small portion of the tale of this ever changing procession, which is for ever appearing over the sunrise hills of to-morrow and passing into the twilight valleys of yesterday, is the engrossing task of the novelist and the teller of tales. How well that task is accomplished, is the measure of the story-teller's power. He may pick his characters from homely types that we know, and please us with the familiar; or he may paint for us some portion of the great",0,0.0
"a politely questioning look. ""Charles, you know I wouldn't call you here at this hour if it wasn't important,"" Edwin said, pursing his lips. ""Of course not, sir,"" Charles replied, waiting. ""The fact of the matter is, we are in dire straits."" Edwin stared at the other ominously. ""As you well know, the Textile Industry, like every other business firm in the world, has functioned entirely without economic troubles of any sort for the past fifty years."" ""Well, of course, sir...."" ""And you are also well aware of what would be the results of any financial deviation in any of these firms, particularly in a major industry such as our own."" ""Certainly, sir. Ours is a delicately balanced economic system. Any slight change in the economic status of one firm would...."" ""Exactly!"" Edwin leaned across the desk and glared at him. ""I have just come from a Board of Directors meeting. And it was made known to us that during the past three weeks our margin of profit has fallen off by three tenths of a per cent!"" Charles' face turned pasty white. He swallowed and took a deep breath. ""Will that information be made public, sir?"" ""Naturally not! But we aren't sure just how long we can keep it a secret! The fact of the matter is, the IBM says that our profit margin will continue to spiral downward at a gradually increasing rate unless some drastic change occurs in our production set-up!"" Edwin leaned back and clasped his hands, composing himself. ""The precise reasons for the existence of the situation are quite obscure. However, the IBM has informed us that the problem can be remedied if we make a particular change in our production system, and it has informed us as to the nature of that change."" He stood up and placed a finger on a capacitance switch. A panel in the Wall slid back to reveal six sales charts. There were two each marked _Winter_, _Summer_ and _Spring-Fall_. Three were designated _marlons_, and three _marilyns_. Each of them showed a red line rising steeply on the left, levelling out to a perfectly straight bar all the way across, then dipping sharply again. ""Look here,"" Edwin said. ""These are the sales charts for our six suits. As you know, we make three different types for marlons, and three for marilyns. Hot-weather, cold-weather, and medium-weather. Each suit is designed to last a carefully calculated length of time, and each consumer need only buy three suits a year. They are exactly alike except for slight size differences, and because of elastic fabrics these differences are held to a minimum. With this system the Textile Industry attained the ultimate in Standardization, the ultimate in efficiency."" Charles rubbed his chin thoughtfully. ""Has the IBM suggested any alternative to our system, any possible change?"" Edwin sat down again, folded his arms on the desk, and scowled. ""That's where you come in! The IBM informs us that there is only one possible way to stabilize our economy, to raise our profit margin to its former level--and that is by further standardization!"" Charles raised his eyebrows. ""You mean a sexless wardrobe, sir? That's been tried...."" ""No, that's _not_ what I mean!"" Edwin snapped. ""What I mean is an _all-weather suit_!"" Charles swallowed audibly at that and said nothing. ""You can see the advantages, of course,"" Edwin explained. ""We'd need only to manufacture two types of suit, marlon and marilyn. Since we'd never have to adjust our factories, we could drop a lot of unnecessary technicians, and with the further standardization, manufacturing would be faster and cheaper--a _lot_ cheaper. The consumer would only purchase one suit a year, but we could make up for that by raising the prices somewhat."" Charles finally got a word in. ""But, _sir_! An all-weather suit? How can we design a suit that will be equally comfortable in the middle of a Florida heat-wave or a New England snowstorm?"" ""How? _How?_"" Edwin's voice raised and his finger pointed. ""_You're_ the research chemist, Charles! You're supposed to tell _me_ how!"" ""Sir? I...."" ""Listen!"" Edwin poked the other in the chest. ""I assume you know what will happen to Society if the Textile Industry becomes economically unstable?"" ""Well, yes sir, but...."" ""Then I assume you realize that the Board of Directors will stop at nothing to preserve the status quo! And since you happen to be our chief industrial chemist, the entire problem lands in your lap! Now, we want to know how to make an all-weather suit, and we want to know _fast_. Therefore, Charles, you're going to tell us how to do it! Understand?"" Charles nodded unhappily. ""Yes sir, I understand."" * * * * * Charles went to work the next day after informing his wife that she could expect him to begin keeping rather irregular hours at the laboratory. The idea of any kind of irregularity was enough to worry any wife, and Ingrid was the naturally suspicious type. She was always nagging and had, upon occasion, even gone so far as to insinuate that Charles had individualist tendencies. So he knew that she would, embarrassingly, call Edwin to check up on him, but he didn't really care. The real problem was the all-weather suit. Charles put his small corps of assistants on the project, investigating several lines of thought at once. Every day, someone would drop around for a while to check on his progress, and he had no delusions about what would happen if he failed. The entire economic stability of his society depended on his coming up with an all-weather suit, and he began to have trouble sleeping nights. Eventually, he found what looked like a workable solution. He called Edwin to tell him about it, and Edwin came down to the lab to see for himself. ""Is _this_ it?"" he asked, picking up what looked like a burlap handkerchief. Charles cleared his throat. ""Well, that's the first sample, sir. Of course, it's possible to obtain",0,0.0
"The Lipka Tatars, a Turkic ethnic group, have a fascinating history that spans the lands of Lithuania, Belarus, and Poland. Originating from the Golden Horde, they established themselves in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania during the 14th century. Over the centuries, the Lipka Tatars have left an enduring mark on the cultural fabric of the region.

The story of the Lipka Tatars begins with their migration from the Mongol Empire. As part of the Golden Horde, they were initially a predominantly nomadic people. However, in the aftermath of the Mongol conquests, some groups began to settle in various parts of Eastern Europe. One of these groups, known as the Lipka Tatars, found refuge in the lands of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.

The Lipka Tatars' settlement in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was a mutually beneficial arrangement. The Lithuanian rulers welcomed them as skilled warriors and sought their services in the military campaigns against the Teutonic Order. In return, the Lipka Tatars were granted privileges, such as the right to practice Islam and maintain their own religious institutions.

Religion played a significant role in the lives of the Lipka Tatars. As devout Muslims, they established mosques and religious schools in their settlements. The most prominent of these was the Great Mosque in the capital city of Vilnius, which still stands today as a testament to their religious heritage. The Lipka Tatars' religious practices were influenced by both Turkic and local traditions, creating a unique blend of customs.

While the Lipka Tatars maintained their Islamic faith, they gradually adopted the local languages of the areas in which they settled. Initially, they spoke a Turkic language known as the Lipka Tatar language. However, due to their interactions with the local Slavic population, particularly in Belarus and Poland, they began to adopt Belarusian and Polish dialects. This linguistic assimilation did not diminish their ethnic identity, but rather highlighted their ability to adapt to their surroundings.

The Lipka Tatars also played a significant role in military campaigns throughout the region. They were renowned for their skills as light cavalry, and their participation in various conflicts made them crucial allies to the Lithuanian and Polish armies. Their equestrian expertise and knowledge of nomadic warfare tactics were highly valued, earning them a fearsome reputation on the battlefield.

Throughout history, the Lipka Tatars experienced multiple waves of migration. In the 17th century, many Lipka Tatars migrated to the Ottoman Empire, seeking better opportunities and more favorable political conditions. This migration reduced their population in the region significantly, but a notable community of Lipka Tatars still remains in Poland.

In the 18th century, the Lipka Tatars faced a rebellion against the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Frustrated with the erosion of their privileges and rights, they joined forces with other discontented groups to rebel against the Polish nobility. Although the rebellion ultimately failed, it highlighted the Lipka Tatars' enduring struggle for autonomy and recognition.

Despite their relatively small numbers, the Lipka Tatars have left an indelible mark on the history and culture of Lithuania, Belarus, and Poland. Their settlement in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania brought new customs, languages, and religious practices to the region. Today, the Lipka Tatars serve as a living testament to the rich diversity and shared history of these lands.",1,0.0

I don't think this is a really good rule..cuz spain scored less goals but also conceded less goals than greece...so oyeah...guess lady luck wasn't on spain's side. But the blame has to go to Spain, there was substandard marking and defending all throughout the game, they didn't show the drive and determination that got them thus far, and they were looking like they were playing with each other for the first time in their lives. They have one of the most impressive looking squads in the world, sometimes capable of scintillating displays of football, but guess they've under-achieved yet again. Had to wake up real early cuz i was going to ""Wild Wild Wet"" with my dear nephews and niece who are returning to the states tomorrow. Got there at around 10, and the queue was already considerably long. But we still managed to get in after a short wait, guess the staff there were pretty effecient about doing their stuff, got in eventually and had to change and stuff. Geez. My younger nephew and niece are really cute...they keep trying to hold my hand and bring me somewhere..and cuz i was carrying my stuff on one hand...they had to fight for my other hand...lol. Eventually their mum, my cousin-in-law, who is pregnant once again, suggested that she hold my stuff while i hold their hands and look after them..lol. Popped up in the main area, their mum said my cousin and I could go for the adult rides on our own first..so well..we did. We went to this gigantic v-shaped object where we saw people sliding down one side of the V at uber-high velocity, cuz the v shape, one one side was about 70 degrees from the ground. Got our float, which was meant for 2 persons, and well soon it was our turn...and woah..it was really really fun. It was an exhilarating experience, sliding down at such a high speed...something like a roller coaster...haha...so we went down the 70 degree side, and went up the other side of the V shape, and down again, and up for a couple of times. It wasn't exactly spine-chilling, but my butt hurt after the ride...cuz of abrasion with the ground...argh... Went for a couple more rides and slides,but the first one was the most fun...haha...just that the repercussions weren't exactly much appreciated by most of the guests...haha..it was pretty evident...lol. So came babysitting, i had to take care of the younger nephew, and he kept bugging me to go with him on the slides, which he eventually had the courage to do it on his own..haha..he's only 4 years old by the way..lol..and i had to carry him up so he could activate one of those water-shooting devices, and he didn't get tired of them until after donkey years...so well..my arm got so sore after that it started trembling in the later part of the day. Now i know how my mum, and all mums felt when bringing up their children. I wouldn't say it's frustrating..though it can get quite exasperating at times...but it really is exhausting both physically and mentally. But well, being with them is a feeling that cannot be expressed..this is an area where language founders at sea. Wasn't really that exhausted when i got home, so when to st. ignatius to play football with clement..found that my crossing is pretty good now..haha..oh well..it was really fun..just catching up and playing 1v1 and stuff..even though the father tried to chase us away..i quote him "" You kenna my glass window u pay ah!"" But well, guess it didn't pull off...lol..played 1 half hours of soccer...was really shagged after that...but still woke up this morning to watch england win croatia...damn...i really want the underdogs to prevail this time round..they almost did...the swiss and the croats...it was a gallant effort to fight for pride..couple of nice goals as well. Rooney impressed yet again...now it's become 9 goals in 10 international games for him. I have to say...that's a brilliant record. Hands down to him..but i guess he has to watch his attitude sometimes... Sorry for yet another loooong and draggy entry..but well...feeling real crappy now..gonna go watch lp live at padang tonite..=) Just to end off..this is something interesting i got From MountainWings..these excerpts are based on true experiences...and the stories are first hand accounts of experiences of what they would call ""MountainWings moment"" ""Sit down so that I can take",0,0.0
"Air Jamaica Ltd v Charlton [1999] UKPC 20 is an English trusts law case, concerning resulting trusts. In it Lord Millett expressed the view that a resulting trust arises because of the absence of intention to benefit a recipient of money. Air Jamaica Ltd had set up a pension trust for the benefit of its employees, funded by contributions from its employees' salaries. When the company was privatised, J$400 million was left over in the pension fund. Clause 4 of the pension deed provided that ‘No moneys which at any time have been contributed by the Company under the terms hereof shall in any circumstances be repayable to the Company’. Air Jamaica Ltd wished to remove clause 4, and change clause 13.3 to say that surpluses would be held on trust for the company. The Judge held that clause 13.3 was void, going against the rule against perpetuity, and so the surplus passed on trust as bona vacantia to the Crown. The Court of Appeal held that the surplus should be dealt under the rules of the scheme, by the trustees. The Privy Council advised that a resulting trust of the surplus funds could still arise in favour of the company, and so it would not be bona vacantia. Clause 13.3 would usually be void for perpetuity because there was no statutory exemption in Jamaica to the common law rule. But with each new member, there was a new settlement, and each member was a life in being, so the termination of a new settlement could in fact be calculated, and so the scheme was in fact not void for perpetuity. The powers for the trustees to change the settlement’s terms were void for perpetuity, and so was the power for the widows to designate a beneficiary to receive benefits, because these were only contingent on termination of the plan itself which could occur more than 21 years after the death of any particular beneficiary. (The individual settlements were contingent on the death of each individual beneficiary under the scheme.) In any event, the scheme’s terms prohibited granting beneficial rights in the scheme to the company in clause 4. But a resulting trust for the company could still exist. Lord Millett remarked[1] that although Mr Vandervell, in Re Vandervell No 2 did not wish the share option to result to him, he did not wish to make an outright gift to the trustee company either. A presumption in the transferor’s favour can only be made where there is no evidence that there was an intention to create a trust, or make a gift, or make a loan of the property to the transferee. ;The validity of the 1994 amendments 41. Their Lordships are satisfied that the 1994 amendments are incurably bad. There are several reasons for this. In the first place, as their Lordships have already explained, any power to amend the trusts is void for perpetuity. This does not mean that an amendment is wholly without effect. An employee who joins the Plan after an amendment makes his settlement upon the trusts of the Plan as amended. But an amendment cannot affect existing Members. The 1994 amendments, which were made after the Plan had been closed to new Members, were therefore without effect. 42. In the second place, and perpetuity apart, the Company’s power to amend the Plan was subject to an obligation to exercise it in good faith: see Imperial Group Pension Trust Ltd v Imperial Tobacco Ltd [1991] 1 W.L.R. 589. The Company was not entitled simply to disregard or override the interests of the Members. Once it became likely that the Plan would be wound up, the Company would have to take this fact into account, and it is difficult to see how the Plan could lawfully be amended in any significant respect once it had actually been discontinued. But even if it could, their Lordships are satisfied that it could not be amended in order to confer any interest in the trust fund on the Company. This was expressly prohibited by clause 4 of the Trust Deed. The 1994 amendments included a purported amendment to the Trust Deed to remove this limitation, but this was plainly invalid. The trustees could not achieve by two steps what they could not achieve by one. 43. Prima facie the surplus is held on a resulting trust for those who provided it. This sometimes creates a problem of some perplexity. In the present case, however, it does not. Contributions were payable by the Members with matching contributions by the Company. In the absence of any evidence that this is not what happened in practice, the surplus must be treated as provided as to one half by the Company and as to one half by the Members. 44. The Attorney-General contended that neither the Company nor the Members can take any part in the surplus, which has reverted to the Crown as bona vacantia. He argued that clause 4 of the Trust Deed precludes any claim by the Company, while the Members cannot claim any part of the surplus because they have received all that they are entitled to. There is authority for both propositions. Their Lordships consider that they can be supported neither in principle nor as a matter of construction. 45. In In re A.B.C. Television Ltd. Pension Scheme unreported, 22nd May 1973 Foster J. held that a clause similar to clause 4 of the present Trust Deed ""negatives the possibility of implying a resulting trust"". This is wrong in principle. Like a constructive trust, a resulting trust arises by operation of law, though unlike a constructive trust it gives effect to intention. But it arises whether or not the transferor intended to retain a beneficial interest - he almost always does not - since it responds to the absence of any intention on his part to pass a beneficial interest to the recipient. It may arise even where the transferor positively wished to part with the beneficial",0,0.0
"Story: History of the nWo: Scott Hall appears on Nitro promising a ""takeover"". The next week, Kevin Nash appears and promises the same thing. They attack people for the next month or so (most notably powerbombing Eric Bischoff through a table) until challenged by Sting, Lex Luger, and Randy Savage to a six-man tag at Bash at the Beach. Nash and Hall - at this point only ""The Outsiders"" - accept, and say their third man will be revealed later. Hall and Nash are victorious when their third man is revealed to be Hulk Hogan, who over time adopts the new persona of ""Hollywood"" Hogan. The newly-christened New World Order begins attacking WCW wrestlers viciously. The first new members to arrive are Ted DiBiase (acting as a manager and ""money man"") and Vincent (acting as ""head of security""). At Road Wild, Hollywood Hogan defeats the Giant by cheating outrageously to win the WCW World title. Strangely, the Giant joins the nWo two weeks later, citing the money as his primary reason. Also at Road Wild, the Booty Man tries to join, but is beaten up. The next member of the nWo appears when they debut a ""Fake Sting"" at Wargames, who wrestles ittermitently over the next few months until the original Fake Sting, now called ""nWo Sting"", goes to compete in Japan as part of their version of the nWo. The Nasty Boys try to join the nWo as well, but are beaten up for their trouble. Although he is in fact the seventh member, Sean Waltman joins in November as Syxx. The nWo announces a ""membership drive"", giving ""all WCW wrestlers"" the chance to join the nWo. In order, the wrestlers accepting this offer are Marcus Bagwell (soon redubbed ""Buff""), Michael Wallstreet, Big Bubba, and Scott Norton. Also, Eric Bischoff is revealed as being an nWo member around this time, and Masa Chono and the Great Muta, visiting from New Japan Pro Wrestling, join the North American nWo (although they have little effect). At the same time, Giant is kicked out for demanding a title shot from Hulk Hogan. Randy Savage joins the nWo at SuperBrawl. Newly appointed WCW Commissioner J.J. Dillon says that according to their contracts, Big Bubba and Michael Wallstreet cannot be members of the nWo. Amidst great hype, Dennis Rodman ""joins"" the nWo, despite wrestling only one match that year as a celebrity guest at Bash at the Beach. Konnan joins the nWo in August. Ted DiBiase quits the nWo and becomes a manager for the Steiner brothers. Curt Hennig joins the nWo after turning on the Four Horsemen at WarGames. Rick Rude joins in December. Bret Hart is invited to join the nWo, but declines. The Disciple joins sometime in January, although he is not named until March. Dusty Rhodes joins at Souled Out after turning on Larry Zybysko. Bryan Adams joins in January after turning on Bret Hart. Scott Steiner joins in February after turning on his brother Rick. During most of January, Louie Spicolli acts as a flunky to Scott Hall and wears an nWo t-shirt, although he is never ""officially"" inducted into the nWo before his death. Syxx disappears when Sean Waltman is fired by WCW. Randy Savage and Kevin Nash, having issues with Hollywood Hogan, form the nWo ""splinter faction"": nWo Wolfpac. Curt Hennig and Konnan immediately join, as do longtime nWo foes Lex Luger and Sting; they immediately distinguish themselves from the ""traditional"" nWo (now known as nWo Hollywood or nWo Black-And-White) by wearing black-and-red T-shirts rather than black-and-white. Scott Hall is invited to join the Wolfpac, but refuses. Giant rejoins nWo Hollywood. Curt Hennig quits the nWo Wolfpac to rejoin nWo Hollywood. Randy Savage is injured and disappears from the Wolfpac. Dennis Rodman once again is trumpeted as a member of the nWo for a celebrity match at Bash At The Beach. Stevie Ray joins nWo Hollywood in September. The Disciple quits nWo Hollywood in October to join the ""One Warrior Nation"". Horace Hogan joins nWo Hollywood at Halloween Havoc. Bret Hart seemingly joins, quits, and rejoins nWo Hollywood several times during this period, and never wears an nWo shirt or explicitly states his membership in the nWo. Hollywood Hogan announces his ""retirement"", and Scott Steiner becomes the leader of nWo Hollywood. Scott Hall is kicked out of nWo Hollywood in November, but despite his efforts is not allowed to join nWo Wolfpac. Disco Inferno starts claiming he is a member of the Wolfpac. Hollywood Hogan comes out of ""retirement"" to ""beat"" Kevin Nash in a thrown match for the WCW World title and reform the nWo as one single entity. The Wolfpac is now an ""elite rank"" of the nWo: its members are Hollywood Hogan, Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, Lex Luger, Buff Bagwell, and Scott Steiner. The remainder of the nWo (Giant, Curt Hennig, Vincent, Stevie Ray, Bryan Adams, Scott Norton, and Horace Hogan) continues wearing the black-and-white, while the Wolfpac wears black, white, and red. The Wolfpac also seems to be conducting a gradual elimination of the black-and-white (also referred to as ""the nWo B-Team""); at this writing, both the Giant and Curt Hennig have received turfing-out beatdowns, with more likely to come. Konnan has been explicitly kicked out of the nWo entire. Sting's status is unknown. Bret Hart's nWo membership is entirely forgotten. With Scott Hall in retirement, Hulk Hogan back in semi-retirement, and Bagwell turfed from the group, the only members left are Lex Luger, Kevin Nash and Scott Steiner, and possibly Disco Inferno. Steiner and Nash rarely do anything nWo-related (besides use the Wolfpac music). The nWo black-and-white is whittled down to Vincent, Horace Hogan, Stevie Ray and Bryan Adams, with Scott Norton doing his own thing without the nWo name. Soon after, Horace Hogan is fired, Bryan Adams is repackaged, Stevie Ray leaves to reform Harlem Heat, and Vincent joins the West Texas Rednecks, thus finally ending the group’s legacy once and for all. The concept was originally started by Scott Hall,",0,0.0
"Manuela's heart felt heavy as she walked the narrow, cobblestone streets of New Orleans. The air was thick with humidity, carrying the sweet scent of magnolias and the distant sound of jazz music. She was determined to find solace from the pain of her recent betrayal, and she had heard whispers of a wise fortune teller who resided in the heart of the city.

Dressed in a flowing sundress and a wide-brimmed hat to shield her from the scorching sun, Manuela navigated the vibrant French Quarter, with its colorful buildings adorned with intricate ironwork balconies. The city was alive with energy, tourists and locals mingling on every street corner.

Her footsteps echoed as she crossed the main square, Jackson Square, and made her way towards Royal Street. The sun cast long shadows as it began its descent, painting the streets with a warm golden hue. Manuela could feel a tingling sensation in her fingertips, as if the city itself was calling to her, urging her to seek answers.

Finally, she arrived at the fortune teller's house, tucked away in a quiet corner of the French Quarter. The entrance was hidden behind a thick curtain of ivy, its leaves dappled with the fading light. Manuela's heart fluttered with anticipation as she climbed the steps, her footsteps muffled by the soft carpet covering them.

Inside, the atmosphere was enchanting. The room was dimly lit, adorned with tapestries and trinkets from around the world. The scent of incense hung in the air, mingling with the faint whispers of a melody playing on an old gramophone. The fortune teller, an elderly woman with wise eyes and a serene smile, sat behind a small table covered in velvet cloth.

Manuela approached tentatively, her voice barely above a whisper, ""Madame, I seek guidance. My heart has been shattered.""

The fortune teller motioned for her to sit, her hands delicate yet full of purpose. ""My dear, I can sense the weight of your pain. Tell me your story, and let the cards reveal their secrets.""

Manuela poured her heart out, recounting the love she had once cherished, now betrayed by lies and deceit. Tears welled up in her eyes, and she could hardly find the strength to continue.

The fortune teller listened intently, her gaze fixed on Manuela's face. When she had finished, the elderly woman gently placed a deck of tarot cards on the table, sliding them towards Manuela.

""Shuffle the cards, my dear, and let them guide you towards the truth you seek.""

Manuela hesitated, her hands trembling ever so slightly as she picked up the cards. She focused on her question, the ache in her heart, and she began shuffling them. The sound of the cards fluttering against each other filled the room, the only noise that existed in that moment.

Once she finished, the fortune teller spread the cards out in a fan-like formation, studying them intently. Her fingers moved across the cards, lingering on a few before finally speaking.

""Manuela, my child, you have been deceived by someone you held dear. But know this – their betrayal is not a reflection of your worth. The path you were on was not meant for you, for destiny has something greater in store.""

Manuela's eyes widened, a glimmer of hope flickering within her. ""What should I do, Madame? How do I find my way?""

The fortune teller leaned closer, her voice almost a whisper. ""You must listen to the whispers of your heart, my dear. Trust in your intuition, for it will guide you towards true love. Let go of the pain that binds you, and embrace the new beginnings that lie ahead.""

A sense of calm washed over Manuela, as if a weight had been lifted from her shoulders. The fortune teller's words resonated deep within her, filling her with a newfound strength and determination.

As Manuela thanked the fortune teller and left her house, the sun had set, and the streets of New Orleans glowed under the soft illumination of gas lamps. She walked with a lightness in her step, her heart no longer burdened by the pain of betrayal.

She knew that the path ahead would not be easy, but armed with the wisdom of the fortune teller, she felt ready to face her future with open arms. The city seemed to embrace her, its vibrant spirit intertwined with her own, as she ventured forth into the night, guided by the whispers of her heart.",1,0.0
"I sat frozen in my chair, my mind racing with fear and confusion. This was not the Joe Arnold I knew. This was something... unnatural. The room seemed to close in on me as the reality of the situation sank in. I was face to face with a supernatural being.

I managed to find my voice, though it came out as a shaky whisper. ""What... what are you?""

The creature chuckled, a sound that sent shivers down my spine. ""Oh, dear Jerry, I am what you humans call a Slizzer. We feed off the emotions of others, and your triumph was just too delicious to resist.""

I felt a wave of nausea wash over me. I had unknowingly become a source of food for this creature. Fear mingled with anger as I thought about how Joe had lured me into this situation, using our weekly card game as a way to trap me.

""You... you've been using us all along,"" I managed to say, my voice gaining strength.

The Slizzer's grin widened, revealing rows of sharp, pointed teeth. ""Yes, my dear Jerry, we have been among you for quite some time. We choose our hosts carefully, ensuring we have a steady supply of emotions to feast upon.""

My mind raced, trying to come up with a plan. How could I escape this creature? How could I protect myself and warn others about its presence? The reality was sinking in that I was dealing with something far beyond my comprehension.

Just as despair threatened to overwhelm me, a sudden burst of courage surged within me. I had to find a way to fight back, to escape the clutches of this supernatural being. Gathering my strength, I slowly stood up from the chair, my legs trembling.

""You won't consume me,"" I declared, my voice steady and defiant. ""I refuse to be your meal.""

The Slizzer laughed, a chilling sound that echoed in the room. It stood up as well, towering over me. ""Oh, Jerry, you are a brave one. But I'm afraid your defiance won't change your fate. Once we have chosen our prey, there is no escape.""

I clenched my fists, determination flowing through my veins. I couldn't let fear paralyze me. I had to fight back, even if the odds were against me.

In a split second, I lunged towards the Slizzer, aiming for its grotesque face. To my surprise, my fist connected with solid flesh, sending the creature stumbling backward. It let out a guttural growl, its eyes burning with rage.

But I didn't back down. I continued to fight, landing blow after blow, all the while knowing that I was risking my life. I had no idea if I could defeat this supernatural being, but I couldn't stand by and let it continue to prey on innocent people.

In the midst of the chaotic struggle, a loud crash suddenly echoed through the apartment. The door burst open, and my friends rushed in, their eyes widening in shock at the scene before them.

""What the hell is going on?"" Mel, the new guy, exclaimed.

With a burst of adrenaline, I managed to shout, ""It's a Slizzer! We need to stop it!""

Mel and the others hesitated for a moment, disbelief evident on their faces. But as the Slizzer charged at me, its claws outstretched, they sprang into action. We fought together, using every ounce of strength we had to overpower the creature.

In the end, it was a combined effort that brought the Slizzer down. We managed to drive it away, forcing it to retreat back into the shadows from whence it came. We were left battered and bruised, but victorious.

As we caught our breath, the room was filled with a silence that felt heavy with the weight of what we had just experienced. Mel, his voice trembling, finally spoke up.

""What... what was that thing?""

I nodded, still trying to process everything. ""A Slizzer. It feeds off our emotions, preying on our highs and lows.""

There was a solemn understanding among us. We had all fallen victim to the creature's manipulation, but together, we had found the strength to fight back. From that night on, we swore to remain vigilant, to protect ourselves and others from the paranormal dangers that lurked in the shadows.

As for Joe Arnold, well, his apartment remained empty, a constant reminder of the close encounter we had with the supernatural. We never saw him again, and I couldn't help but wonder if he had become a host for another Slizzer. But one thing was for certain – we would never let our guard down again. The world was full of mysteries, and we were determined to face them head-on, armed with the knowledge that supernatural beings exist, and that we had the power to resist their influence.",1,-1.0
"""Do I Wanna Know?"" is a song by English rock band Arctic Monkeys, with lyrics written by frontman Alex Turner. It was released on 19 June 2013 by Domino Recording Company as the second single from their fifth studio album, AM (2013). It received a digital download release through iTunes as well as an accompanying music video. Before its release as a single, the song was premiered by the band live in May 2013 on the AM Tour, where it was often played as the opening number. It is an indie rock, psychedelic rock, stoner rock and blues rock song, and is built around a stomping guitar riff. ""Do I Wanna Know?"" peaked at number 11 in the UK Singles Chart, charted in several other countries and was the first Arctic Monkeys song to have ever entered the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States, peaking at number 70 in March 2014. The song was nominated for Best Rock Performance at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards in 2015. In December 2019, the song was ranked number three on Guitar World's list of the 20 best guitar riffs of the decade. The song has accumulated about 1.8 billion streams on Spotify and ranks in the 100 most-streamed songs in the streaming platform’s history, and its music video has earned 1.4 billion views on YouTube. ""Do I Wanna Know?"" is performed in the key of G minor.[1] Musically, it has been described as an indie rock,[2] psychedelic rock,[3] stoner rock,[4] blues rock[5] and alternative rock song.[6] The song has a similar aesthetic style and lyrical content to their 2012 song ""R U Mine?""; it is more downtempo while having similar guitar riffs.[7] PopMatters describes it as ""a cleaner, slower-burning 'R U Mine?'"", while also finding its ""stomping"" style to be a ""steadier take"" on the music found on Humbug (2009).[8] The song also contains the edgier sound found on their previous album Suck It and See (2011).[7] In concert, singer and guitarist Alex Turner uses a Vox 12-string electric guitar.[9] Structurally, the song follows a common pop music ""verse-pre-chorus-chorus"" form up until its second chorus; from that point on, it follows what Hit Songs Deconstructed calls ""a more unorthodox flow"" ending in a ""pre-chorus/chorus hybrid section"". Falsetto backing vocals are also blended with those of Turner's throughout the song. Moreover, the title encapsulates the entire premise of the story, the narrator wondering whether he wants to remain in doubt or know if his feelings are unrequited or mutual.[10] ""Do I Wanna Know"" was first played live on 22 May 2013 in Ventura, California at the first concert of the band's AM Tour. Throughout the tour, the song was being played as the opening number. It was then released as AM's second single on 19 June 2013, appearing in digital download formats through iTunes. It was accompanied by a music video released on YouTube.[11][12] The single was released with no promotion, allowing fans to purchase it through iTunes immediately.[13][14] A 7-inch vinyl edition of the single was released on 22 July 2013, with a B-side titled ""2013"".[15] On AM, ""Do I Wanna Know?"" appears as the opening track.[16] Rolling Stone ranked ""Do I Wanna Know?"" as the tenth best song of 2013, calling it ""the highlight of the U.K. crew's soul-rock overhaul album AM.""[17] The song was nominated for Best Rock Performance at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards in 2015,[18] losing to ""Lazaretto"" by Jack White.[19] In December 2019, the song was ranked number three on Guitar World's list of the 20 best guitar riffs of the decade.[20] NME later ranked the song as the fifth best song of the 2010s decade.[21] Despite a midweek on air on sale release, the song entered the UK Singles Chart at number 11,[22] making it the band's highest-charting single since ""Fluorescent Adolescent"" in 2007. This was subsequently outperformed by the next single ""Why'd You Only Call Me When You're High?"", which debuted at number eight. ""Do I Wanna Know?"" has spent 65 weeks in the UK top 100, this being the longest run of any Arctic Monkeys single, to date.[23] The single was awarded a platinum certification by the BPI on 7 February 2015, indicating shipments in excess of 600,000 units; it is the first Arctic Monkeys single to do so. As of 2023, it is certified quadruple-platinum in the UK.[24] The song had moderate success worldwide, charting in countries such as Australia, France, Belgium, Ireland and Israel. In January 2014, the song reached number one on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart,[25] the group's first number one single in the United States and their first appearance on that chart since ""I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor"" peaked at number seven in 2006.[26] On 28 March, the track became the 30th song to have occupied the Billboard Alternative Songs chart top spot for 10 weeks or more. As of the 25 October 2014 issue of Billboard, it logged 58 weeks on the Alternative Songs list, making it the second-longest running song on the chart. It also became the band's first single to appear on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, peaking at number 70 in March 2014.[27] On 26 January 2014, the song reached number four on Triple J's Hottest 100 of 2013, and, on 14 March 2020, reached number three on Triple J's Hottest 100 of 2010s. The music video for ""Do I Wanna Know?"", directed by David Wilson with animation agency Blinkink,[28] was first released onto YouTube on 18 June 2013. As of June 2020, it has been viewed over 1 billion times,[29] becoming one of only 12 rock videos to achieve this feat.[30] The video begins with a black background and simple visuals of white sound waves (similar to the AM cover art) that vibrate in synchronisation, first with the percussion and lead guitar, then with the lead singer, Alex Turner. As the band enters with the chorus, coloured sound waves illustrate new voices. Simple sound waves then give way to fast-moving,",0,0.0
"Enclaves and exclaves are fascinating geographical phenomena that have significant historical and political implications. They refer to portions of land surrounded by another country's territory or detached from their parent country, respectively. Understanding these concepts helps shed light on the complexities of border disputes, identity politics, and the challenges faced by communities living in these unique territories.

Enclaves are territories that are fully surrounded by another country's land. These isolated regions can be remnants of ancient empires, remnants of military conquests, or artifacts of historical border disputes. Enclaves often present unique challenges for the people living within them, as they must navigate the laws, policies, and cultural practices of the surrounding country. These areas exist as if they were islands, with their own communities, infrastructure, and institutions.

One of the most famous examples of an enclave is the Vatican City, located within the city of Rome, Italy. The Vatican City serves as the spiritual and administrative headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church and is recognized as an independent city-state. Despite being surrounded by Italy, the Vatican City has its own laws, postal system, and even its own armed forces, the Swiss Guard. The unique status of the Vatican City as an enclave is a testament to the influence and power of the Catholic Church throughout history.

Another notable enclave is Baarle-Hertog and Baarle-Nassau. This complex arrangement consists of 22 Belgian enclaves interspersed within the larger Dutch enclave of Baarle-Nassau. The intricate border pattern has resulted from centuries of competing claims and territorial exchanges between the Netherlands and Belgium. The result is a patchwork of enclaves, often with houses or businesses straddling the border, each governed by the laws of their respective countries. This unique situation requires residents to be aware of which country they are in at any given time, making Baarle-Hertog and Baarle-Nassau a curiously divided community.

On the other hand, exclaves are territories that are physically separated from their parent country by the territory of another country. Unlike enclaves, exclaves are usually the result of historical events such as colonization, territorial disputes, or political negotiations. They are often connected to their parent country by a narrow strip of land or a corridor, which provides the only means of access between them.

One of the most well-known examples of an exclave is Kaliningrad Oblast, an isolated Russian territory located between Poland and Lithuania. Formerly known as East Prussia, the region became an exclave of the Soviet Union following World War II when the Baltic states gained independence. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Kaliningrad Oblast remains separated from mainland Russia, making it a unique geopolitical entity. The exclave status of Kaliningrad has significant political implications, as it is the subject of ongoing disputes between Russia, the European Union, and neighboring countries.

Another fascinating example of an exclave is the Alaska Panhandle, also known as Southeast Alaska or the Alaska Boundary Dispute. This narrow strip of land extends from mainland Alaska, crossing through the Canadian province of British Columbia, before ending at the Pacific Ocean. The Alaska Panhandle's status as an exclave has historical origins in the 19th-century territorial negotiations between the United States and the United Kingdom. Despite the geographical separation, the Alaska Panhandle has strong cultural and economic ties to mainland Alaska, as it is connected by ferry and air services.

Both enclaves and exclaves have significant historical, political, and geographical significance. They often serve as reminders of historical conflicts, territorial disputes, or colonial legacies. Enclaves and exclaves can complicate international relations, border disputes, and governance issues, requiring diplomatic negotiations and special agreements between countries. These territories also pose unique challenges for the people living within them, as they must navigate dual legal systems, cultural integration, and often face questions of identity and belonging.

In conclusion, enclaves and exclaves are intriguing phenomena that highlight the complexities of border disputes, sovereignty, and identity politics. They provide a glimpse into the historical, political, and geographical forces that shape our world. From the Vatican City to the Alaska Panhandle, these territorial oddities continue to shape the lives of those who reside within them and attract the curiosity of those who seek to understand the intricate dynamics of our global landscape.",1,0.0
"Oh man, I've got a story for you that still gives me chills every time I think about it. So, a few years back, I was living in this old house that had been in my family for generations. It was a beautiful Victorian-style house, but there was always something strange about it. I never really believed in ghosts or anything supernatural, but this experience made me question everything.

One night, I was home alone, just watching TV in the living room. The whole house was silent, except for the sound of the wind outside. Suddenly, I heard a faint whisper coming from the hallway. At first, I thought it was just my imagination playing tricks on me, but then I heard it again, clearer this time. It sounded like a woman's voice, but I couldn't make out what she was saying.

Feeling a bit freaked out, I cautiously got up to investigate. As I walked closer to the hallway, the voice became louder and more distinct. It was as if someone was standing right next to me, whispering in my ear. I could feel the hairs on the back of my neck standing up, and a cold shiver ran down my spine.

Curiosity got the better of me, and I followed the voice into the dark hallway. As I reached the end of the corridor, I saw a flickering light coming from one of the rooms. It was my late grandmother's old bedroom. The light was pulsating, almost like a heartbeat, and the whispering grew even louder.

Without thinking, I pushed open the door and was immediately hit with a blast of icy air. The room was freezing, even though the rest of the house was warm. The light was coming from an old antique lamp that sat on my grandmother's dresser. The lamp seemed to be glowing with an otherworldly aura.

As I stood there, my heart pounding, I noticed something strange in the mirror on the dresser. A figure, hazy and transparent, was standing behind me. I slowly turned around, my hands trembling. There, in the corner of the room, stood the apparition of a woman. She was dressed in old-fashioned clothing, her face pale and sorrowful. I couldn't believe my eyes.

The woman seemed to be trying to communicate with me, but no sound came out. It was like she was trapped in a different realm, unable to fully interact with the physical world. I could see the sadness and longing in her eyes, as if she had something important to tell me. But it was all so overwhelming, I couldn't make sense of it.

After what felt like an eternity, the figure slowly faded away, and the room returned to its normal temperature. I was left standing there, in awe and disbelief. It was an experience that shook me to my core and made me question everything I thought I knew about the world.

Since that night, I've done a lot of research on the history of my family and the house itself. It turns out that the woman I saw could have been my great-great-grandmother, who died in that very room many years ago. Some say that spirits linger in places that hold strong emotional ties, and it's possible that she was trying to pass on a message or seek closure.

I still have so many questions and wonder what the woman was trying to tell me that night. Was she warning me about something? Was she trying to find peace? I may never know the answers, but that experience opened my mind to the possibility that there are things beyond our understanding in this world.

Ever since that night, I've had a newfound respect for the supernatural and an appreciation for the mysteries of life. It's a reminder that our world is full of unexplained phenomena and that sometimes, we just have to embrace the unknown.",1,0.0
"Dear Friend,

As the sun sets on another long day here at the farm, I find solace in the warmth of my cozy room, pen in hand, ready to embark on another journey through the pages of this letter. There is a certain enchantment that comes with the act of writing, a mysterious connection that transcends time and distance. In this vast world, I have discovered that my greatest confidant lies not in a human companion, but in the crisp white sheets that hold my ink-stained secrets.

My name is Sidney, and I am a young girl who finds herself captivated by the power of words. Living on a farm is not an easy life, with countless chores and responsibilities, but it is within these very tasks that I derive inspiration for my letters. From the break of dawn, as the roosters welcome the sun, to the final rays of light that fade into the night, the rhythm of my day provides a symphony of stories begging to be shared.

There is a certain rawness to life on a farm. The scent of freshly plowed earth dances with the aroma of blooming flowers, while the sound of cows grazing peacefully intertwines with the hustle and bustle of tractors and trucks. Amidst this symphony of nature, I find myself longing for a connection beyond these rustic fences. It is in the quiet corners of my room, surrounded by stacks of stationery and a rainbow of ink bottles, that I find solace, peace, and the freedom to express my deepest thoughts and dreams.

Each month, as the calendar marches forward, I eagerly await the arrival of the postman. With heart aflutter, I quietly slip into the front porch, hoping to catch a glimpse of a familiar face. In those precious moments, as I clutch the envelope between my trembling fingers, it is as if a piece of another world has landed upon my dusty doorstep. It is in these letters that I find a connection, a bridge that spans the distance between my farm and the outer world.

In my letters, I explore the limitless expanse of my imagination. I become a vagabond, a wanderer, and an adventurer. I let my pen dance across the page, painting vivid landscapes and inviting words to dance in rhythm. Sometimes, my letters are filled with stories of far-off lands, where knights valiantly battle dragons and fairies sprinkle magic upon the earth. Other times, they are brimming with tales of the everyday, the small triumphs and challenges that make up the tapestry of my life.

But beyond the tales, there lies a deeper purpose to my letters. They are my silent confidants, my undying companions who listen without judgment or interruption. Within the ink-stained pages, I pour out my sorrows, my hopes, and my dreams. They serve as a mirror, reflecting back to me the beauty and complexity of my own thoughts and feelings. Through my letters, I discover the breadth of my own emotions, as well as the resilience of my spirit.

Writing, dear friend, has become so much more than a mere hobby. It has become a lifeline, a beam of light that pierces the darkest of nights. While the burdens of farm life may weigh heavy upon my young shoulders, the act of putting pen to paper allows me to breathe, to dream, and to find strength in the spaces between the lines.

So, as I conclude this letter, I do so with a heart full of gratitude. Gratitude for the gift of words, the power to create and connect. Gratitude for the freedom to express my innermost thoughts and desires. And most of all, gratitude for the person on the other side of this letter, who has taken the time to read the musings of a young girl finding solace in the written word.

Until our paths cross again on the ethereal pages of a letter, may you find joy and inspiration in the simple act of putting pen to paper.

Yours sincerely,
Sidney",1,0.0
"Mark Twain's Letters from the Earth is a scathing and irreverent critique of religion and morality that showcases the author's biting wit and disdain for organized Christianity. Written during a time of personal struggle for Twain, the book provides a platform for him to express his frustrations and skepticism towards religious institutions, morality, and the concept of God. Twain's sharp and sarcastic voice is evident throughout the book, as he adopts a third-person perspective that allows him to mock and challenge religious beliefs with impunity.

While undoubtedly controversial, Letters from the Earth offers a refreshingly honest and unapologetic examination of religious dogma. Twain's writings in this book were never meant for publication during his lifetime, and it is believed that they were primarily intended as a coping mechanism for the tragic loss of his daughter, Susy Clemens, in 1896. The essays and stories in the book were meant to be personal reflections, providing Twain with an outlet for his inner turmoil and disillusionment with the world. The fact that these writings were so critical of Christianity and morality may have been a testament to Twain's frustration with the ideologies that he felt failed to offer any solace or explanation for the tragic events in his life.

One key figure impacted by the publication of Letters from the Earth was Twain's daughter, Clara Clemens. Initially, Clara objected to the publication of her father's controversial work, fearing that it would tarnish his public image. She believed that the book's provocative views on religion would be received poorly by the public, potentially damaging Twain's reputation as a beloved and respected author. However, over time, Clara's perspective changed, and she eventually became an advocate for the publication of the book after Twain's death. Clara recognized the importance of these writings as a reflection of her father's beliefs and personal struggles, and she acknowledged the significance of preserving his intellectual legacy, regardless of the potential controversy it might generate.

The structure of Letters from the Earth is comprised of a series of letters from Satan to his heavenly counterparts, which gives the book a unique and satirical framing. Twain uses this approach to present his criticisms and challenges to traditional religious ideals and morality. The devil, portrayed as a jaded and disillusioned observer of human behavior, provides a brutally honest assessment of the flaws and contradictions within Christianity. Twain's intention was to expose the hypocritical behavior of religious figures, the absurdity of certain biblical stories, and the questionable moral standards promoted by organized religion.

Several key essays in the book exemplify Twain's disdain for Christianity. In ""The Damned Human Race,"" Twain presents a scathing critique of humanity's self-perceived superiority over other animals. He highlights the contradictions between Christian teachings of love and compassion and the cruel, barbaric behaviors witnessed in human societies. Another notable essay is ""Was the World Made for Man?"" Here, Twain challenges the notion that humans are the pinnacle of creation, suggesting that the world might have been better suited for other creatures or even for Satan himself.

Twain's Letters from the Earth is a courageous and unapologetic exploration of religious beliefs and morality, informed by the author's personal struggles. Its publication had a profound impact on Twain's daughter, Clara Clemens, who initially objected but eventually recognized the importance of preserving her father's intellectual legacy. The book's unique structure and content, conveyed through a series of satirical letters, effectively expose the contradictions and flaws of Christianity. Twain's irreverence and critical voice continue to challenge readers to question long-held religious beliefs and to reevaluate the concept of morality in a world where tragedy often lacks explanation.",1,-1.0

"Dance With Me I have a very active fantasy life. It keeps me sane. It keeps me from getting so depressed that I want to kill myself. I was made to be in Love, and for much of my life I have been denied my purpose. So fantasy, keeping the passion, romance and optimism alive within me is essential. I think it takes this to stay alone and stay focused to work as much as I do. The problem is, for nearly a year I was programming myself with these fantasies that I'd someday meet a beautiful woman to fall in love with, in some far off exotic city. Like NewYork, San Diego, L.A. or even Holland, because those are places I was wanting to go. The thing is, although I ultimately plan to someday move to one of these places it's probably going to be a long time before I do. Consequently, the universe has kept all possibilities of love and relationships from me. Because that's what I was asking for. This seemed to only add to my depression. So the last few weeks, I've been dreaming about new things. More attainable and believable things. But still... they are fantasies. I had a wonderful dream last night... It starts about 8 months from now, the weather is still summer-like and nice out. And all of my friends decide to take me out to celebrate, because I've finally reached my goal weight and they've somehow found out about it. It's dramatically changed the dynamic between my friends and I. It's evident in my confidence and the way they treat me. We go to a bar in my town called Bleacher's. And my favorite local band "" Plain Brown Wrapper "" is playing. It's a fun night. There's drinking and celebration and sweet, sweet rejoicing. One thing about me going out drinking. I almost never get drunk. I usually have a few beers and spend most of the night dancing. It's always been that way, I love to dance. Almost every time that I go out, I'll grab some poor unsuspecting woman, sitting alone, and pull her onto the dance floor ( with her permission and a somewhat bewildered yet curious look ). Usually we're the only ones on the floor, in fact usually there ISN'T a dance floor. We start to dance and have fun and after a couple of songs, we look around and realize that we're no longer alone. Nearly everyone in the building is up and dancing too. It happens this way every time, I guess because after watching us dance, people don't feel so awkward about being out there. It's a magical feeling. So on this particular night when I decide it's time to get up to dance. I find myself wondering how things will be different now that I'm thin and feeling confident in my body. I suspect that confidence in yourself and confidence in your body are two very different things. But I have yet to experience the latter in my dating life. As I state my purpose to the friends at the table and start to look around for a cute, young, rhythmical, victim. One of my friends, a young kid, you know the kind... he's the pretty boy that every girl seems to faun over. He dares me to ask out the most beautiful woman in the bar. I figure, ""What the Hell?"" It's time to try out my hard fought physique and test it's limits. I ask if we all have to agree on what ""most beautiful"" is... but before I can finish my sentence I see her. And so does every one else. It's no contest. There she sits, at a table on a deck just a few feet higher than ours, in the corner of the room. She is surrounded by her friends. All of whom would have been more than beautiful on their own... except they're sitting next to HER. You see it's her smile that does it. She laughs and smiles. That makes her more beautiful than any pouting, primping debutante in this bar. And her dark mysterious eyes... wow, in the glowing neon-lights they take on even more magical powers. And when she laughs, even her eyes seem to smile with her. I finish my beer and march over to her. I'm so focused on the task at hand that I'm completely oblivious to the frat boy hanging around her shoulder. She looks up almost startled at me, I pause for a moment to catch my breath and smile slyly and lower my gaze to intensify the eye-contact. I smile a little wider and hold out my hand and ask her to dance. She smiles in almost exactly the same way and takes my hand. She doesn't look back. As we make our way down towards the band I can here giggles and snickers from the girls at her table. But it doesn't matter... because I have her hand in mine. As we step in front of the band I see a concerned look on her face. She asks me, ""Are you sure this is a dance floor?"" I reply ""Does it matter?"" She laughs and the band starts to play... it's Marvin Gaye.. ""...How Sweet it IS to be LOVED by you..."" ""...I want to STOP... and thank you baby...."" We dance light and playful. She laughs louder and bigger. I can tell she's enjoying it. I twirl her and swirl her into my arms. All eyes are on us. But neither of us notices. We dance like nobody is watching. ""...I needed the shelter.. of someone's arms... and there you were..."" ""...How sweet it IS to be LOVED by you..."" She closes her eyes and leans in closer. I can feel her heart racing against my chest. We dance like we're part of each other. The motions are peaceful and happy. The music plays and plays and I hope that the moment will never",0,0.0

"In the corner of my mind, tucked away from the harsh realities of the world, lies a place of boundless wonder and imagination. It is a universe shaped by my own idealistic beliefs and fanciful daydreams, where the impossible becomes possible and the ordinary is transformed into something extraordinary. This is the realm where my true self resides, where my spirit soars and my heart finds solace.

In my idealistic world, the power of friendship is an unyielding force that knows no boundaries. It is a tapestry woven with threads of trust, love, and unwavering support. Friends are not just companions to share laughter and tears with; they are the pillars that hold us up when we stumble, the guiding lights in the darkest of nights. In this world, friendships transcend time and distance, for the ties that bind us are not confined by physical presence but rather by the profound connections we forge in our souls.

Love, too, takes on a mystical quality in this realm of mine. It is not superficial or fleeting, but rather a force that radiates from the depths of our beings and touches every aspect of our lives. Love is not limited to romantic entanglements; it encompasses the love of family, the love of nature, the love of oneself. It is a transformative energy that has the power to heal wounds, bridge divides, and ignite the flame of passion within each of us. In this utopia of my mind, love is the foundation upon which every interaction is built, and it is celebrated not just on special occasions but in every breath we take.

Creating a better world is not just an idle dream in this imaginative realm of mine; it is a palpable reality. In this world, kindness, compassion, and understanding are the building blocks that shape society. People embrace their differences, rather than fearing them, for they recognize that diversity is the spice that adds flavor to life. Equality and justice are not mere concepts scribbled on paper but the very essence of our existence. In this idealistic world, the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom is cherished, and education is accessible to all, regardless of their backgrounds. The environment thrives under our watchful care, as we recognize our role as stewards of the Earth and strive to leave a legacy of sustainability for future generations.

Books, the portals to infinite worlds, hold a place of great importance in my idealistic world. They are my constant companions, my loyal confidants, and my greatest teachers. Through their pages, I am transported to faraway lands, introduced to characters who become my dearest friends, and granted access to a wealth of knowledge and wisdom. Books are my refuge, my sanctuary from the chaos of reality, and they fuel my imagination, igniting a flame of creativity that sets my mind ablaze. In this world, libraries are revered as sacred spaces, and the written word is treasured as a precious gift to humanity.

But I must confess, my idealistic world is not without its flaws. It is a world where my idealism sometimes blinds me to the complexities and harshness of reality. I yearn for a world where pain and suffering are mere distant memories, where every soul is lifted from the shackles of oppression. I am often accused of being too dreamy, too whimsical, but I cannot help but believe that the power of imagination holds within it the seeds of change.

In the end, my idealistic world may exist only in the realm of thoughts and dreams, but it serves as a guiding light, a lighthouse that keeps me anchored to hope and optimism. It is a place where the possibilities are infinite, where dreams are nurtured, and where the beauty of the world is allowed to flourish. It is within this utopia that I find solace, and it is this belief in the transformative power of friendship, love, and imagination that keeps me inspired to create a better world, one that is closer to the realm of my dreams.",1,0.0
"I wake up to semi-rainy weather, which keeps me from going on the run that I want to take. I get ready for the day and suddenly realize that North Carolina is in the Eastern time zone and that I have been going by Central time. This means that I have 20 minutes to meet Molly (my NC State entomology friend) at Mad Hatters. Yeah, I came really close to screwing that up. Molly and I both show up at Hatters at about the same time. We talk about Duke basketball, dating (or my lack thereof), and old Arts Dorm members whom are married, engaged, whatever. After Hatters, we roam 9th street, which has a handful of very interesting shops and eateries. Molly is looking for a wind chime to give as a gift for a bridal shower. The Regulator Bookstore is the next place we visit. While browsing I get stuck in the self-help section while Molly is looking at children’s books. She finds an illustrated book on the life of Henry David Thoreau and the main character has been drawn as a bear. It was real funny. Franchesca’s was our last stop. It has much more space after having taken over the building space next door. Molly recommends to me some mint latte or something; somehow in the years that I’ve known Molly I never knew that we both liked mint. We spend at least an hour in there talking about movies, our respective academic stuff, and whatever else. It’s funny because we talked about so much, I can’t ever remember it later. I mainly just remember catching up and telling stories that made us both laugh. Oh…she and I have the same car. They’re exactly the same. After 3 hours, we go our separate ways again. She drops me off at the WEL and then continues on the road back to Raleigh. I then call Stephanie, my old resident coordinator (RA boss). We meet up in her new office, a huge improvement from her office last year. Her hair is now short and curly. Stephanie seems to still be happy with her job so she’ll be staying around for a third year next year. Students who live in selective houses and fraternities have been pretty upset with the Residence Life Office decision to do away with the annual review, but Stephanie’s view is that people are blowing things way out of proportion (some people claim that the university is trying to get rid of frats and selectives). Whatever. I tell Stephanie everything that I’ve heard from Michael Barham and Ashley Colburn, and we end our conversation laughing about the fact that there still is no furniture in the “dead-end alcove” on my hall. Go figure! In the EMS office Matt McDaniel and Michelle Hu are getting ready to do scenarios. I couldn’t resist the opportunity to be a patient again so I ended up simulating a chest pain patient first and a hyperventilating mother second. On that last one I actually hyperventilated so much my finger and facial muscles kept consistently contracted for a few minutes afterward. I was real glad about how much Matt and Michelle have progressed over the year. Being a crew chief and doing things like this for my crew members was just about the most fun part of Duke EMS. What is it with the Duke food? I come back to campus and quickly realize that I am unable to finish the meals I used to get all the time. The food point system there on campus seems to promote convenient eating, which means I must have eaten more then than I do now. This must be true ‘cause I’ve also had several people tell me that I look like I’ve lost weight. Matt catches me on the way to the bathroom and it’s evident that he’s anxious about something. I know through the grapevine that Matt has recently been demoted from crew chief. He’s actually had a pretty tough month and he seems to want some damage control advice; he’ll be assuming the I.C. role in two weeks and he’s beginning to feel a bit overwhelmed. We schedule a time to meet and I hope to help him in any way that I can. One of my favorite experiences was going with 7 Duke EMS members to the Durham County EMT-I class. They have the class on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays in the evenings. Fortunately, Kathy Mellown is the instructor. She’s a really good instructor who did one of our EMT-D classes about 2 years ago. The EMTs at the class (Steve Barmach, David Strauss, Jared Miranda, Steev Jones, Shelby Addison, Omaira Pacheco, and Mike Cheung) all had bruises from their previous class when they were practicing IV sticks. Tonight they learned about external jugular IV sticks and pharmacology. It wasn’t a very interactive class, but I pretty much got the idea. I really wish I would have had that kind of opportunity sometime while I was at Duke, but then again I’m in med school and I wouldn’t have had the chance to really use the EMT-I skills that I would have learned. What I thought was very good about the class was that Duke EMS was the most represented agency there and our members were able to network with several other people from different county agencies. I even got to meet with Josh Bordeaux who is an Orange County EMT. Josh (a UNC sophomore), Marcia, and I met probably about 2 years ago to talk about Josh’s goal of establishing a campus EMS squad at UNC. While things haven’t really panned out the way he’d hoped, he is active with Orange County EMS and seems to be happy there. Cosmic Cantina is a staple of the Duke student diet. You can get large amounts of food for very very cheap. I actually forgot to bring money with me to the EMT-I class so I figured that I wouldn’t be",0,0.0
"and was twirling around, his face red and his laughter filling the room. The atmosphere was lively, full of energy and excitement.

I found a couple of empty stools at the bar and motioned for the young spacer to join me. He hesitated for a moment, looking unsure, but then took a seat beside me. The bartender, a friendly middle-aged woman named Carol, came over and asked us what we wanted to drink. I ordered my usual, a whiskey on the rocks, and the spacer asked for another scotch and water.

As we sat there, sipping our drinks, the sounds of laughter and conversation filled the air. People were gathered in groups, chatting and catching up with friends. The band on stage was playing a lively tune, and some people even started dancing near the jukebox.

I struck up a conversation with the spacer, eager to learn more about his life as a spacer. He told me about his experiences traveling to different planets and the challenges he faced in his line of work. It was fascinating to hear about a world so different from my own.

Meanwhile, the bar was getting more and more crowded. People were coming and going, laughing and cheering. There was a sense of camaraderie in the air, as though everyone was there to have a good time and forget about their troubles for a while.

I introduced the spacer to a few of the regulars at the bar, and soon he was engaged in conversations with them. It seemed like he was starting to relax and enjoy himself, letting loose and embracing the lively atmosphere of the bar.

As the night went on, I noticed that the spacer was getting more comfortable in his surroundings. He laughed and joked with the people around him, sharing stories and experiences. It was refreshing to see someone from a different world fitting in so effortlessly.

I glanced at the clock and realized it was getting late. The bar was starting to wind down, with people slowly making their way towards the exit. The band bid their farewells, and the jukebox fell silent. The vibrant energy that had filled the bar was slowly dissipating, leaving behind a sense of contentment and satisfaction.

The spacer and I stood up from our stools, feeling a bit buzzed from the drinks and the lively atmosphere. We said our goodbyes to the remaining patrons and made our way out into the cool night air.

As we walked through the quiet streets, the spacer turned to me and said, ""Thanks for showing me a good time. It was a nice change from my usual routine."" I smiled and replied, ""No problem, kid. You're welcome here anytime.""

We continued walking, our steps in sync with each other. The bustling energy of the bar slowly faded away, but the memories of that night lingered in our minds. It was a night of laughter, camaraderie, and a glimpse into a world beyond my own.

As we reached the corner, we went our separate ways, but I knew that the spacer had found a place for himself in our little community. And for me, that night at the lively bar would always be remembered as a night of connection and the reminder that each person, no matter where they came from, had a story worth hearing and celebrating.",1,0.0

"the framed engraving of Queen Victoria's Coronation, gave token of a concert that was to be held--or, rather, was to have been held some weeks ago--in the town hall for the benefit of the Life-Boat Fund. I looked at the barometer, tapped it, was not the wiser. I wandered to the letter-board. These letter-boards always fascinate me. Usually some two or three of the envelops stuck into the cross-garterings have a certain newness and freshness. They seem sure they will yet be claimed. Why not? Why SHOULDN'T John Doe, Esq., or Mrs. Richard Roe turn up at any moment? I do not know. I can only say that nothing in the world seems to me more unlikely. Thus it is that these young bright envelops touch my heart even more than do their dusty and sallowed seniors. Sour resignation is less touching than impatience for what will not be, than the eagerness that has to wane and wither. Soured beyond measure these old envelops are. They are not nearly so nice as they should be to the young ones. They lose no chance of sneering and discouraging. Such dialogues as this are only too frequent: A Very Young Envelop: Something in me whispers that he will come to-day! A Very Old Envelop: He? Well, that's good! Ha, ha, ha! Why didn't he come last week, when YOU came? What reason have you for supposing he'll ever come now? It isn't as if he were a frequenter of the place. He's never been here. His name is utterly unknown here. You don't suppose he's coming on the chance of finding YOU? A. V. Y. E.: It may seem silly, but--something in me whispers-- A. V. O. E.: Something in YOU? One has only to look at you to see there's nothing in you but a note scribbled to him by a cousin. Look at ME! There are three sheets, closely written, in ME. The lady to whom I am addressed-- A. V. Y. E.: Yes, sir, yes; you told me all about her yesterday. A. V. O. E.: And I shall do so to-day and to-morrow and every day and all day long. That young lady was a widow. She stayed here many times. She was delicate, and the air suited her. She was poor, and the tariff was just within her means. She was lonely, and had need of love. I have in me for her a passionate avowal and strictly honorable proposal, written to her, after many rough copies, by a gentleman who had made her acquaintance under this very roof. He was rich, he was charming, he was in the prime of life. He had asked if he might write to her. She had flutteringly granted his request. He posted me to her the day after his return to London. I looked forward to being torn open by her. I was very sure she would wear me and my contents next to her bosom. She was gone. She had left no address. She never returned. This I tell you, and shall continue to tell you, not because I want any of your callow sympathy,--no, THANK you!--but that you may judge how much less than slight are the probabilities that you yourself-- But my reader has overheard these dialogues as often as I. He wants to know what was odd about this particular letter-board before which I was standing. At first glance I saw nothing odd about it. But presently I distinguished a handwriting that was vaguely familiar. It was mine. I stared, I wondered. There is always a slight shock in seeing an envelop of one's own after it has gone through the post. It looks as if it had gone through so much. But this was the first time I had ever seen an envelop of mine eating its heart out in bondage on a letter-board. This was outrageous. This was hardly to be believed. Sheer kindness had impelled me to write to ""A. V. Laider, Esq.,"" and this was the result! I hadn't minded receiving no answer. Only now, indeed, did I remember that I hadn't received one. In multitudinous London the memory of A. V. Laider and his trouble had soon passed from my mind. But--well, what a lesson not to go out of one's way to write to casual acquaintances! My envelop seemed not to recognize me as its writer. Its gaze was the more piteous for being blank. Even so had I once been gazed at by a dog that I had lost and, after many days, found in the Battersea Home. ""I don't know who you are, but, whoever you are, claim me, take me out of this!"" That was my dog's appeal. This was the appeal of my envelop. I raised my hand to the letter-board, meaning to effect a swift and lawless rescue, but paused at sound of a footstep behind me. The old waiter had come to tell me that my luncheon was ready. I followed him out of the hall, not, however, without a bright glance across my shoulder to reassure the little captive that I should come back. I had the sharp appetite of the convalescent, and this the sea air had whetted already to a finer edge. In touch with a dozen oysters, and with stout, I soon shed away the unreasoning anger I had felt against A. V. Laider. I became merely sorry for him that he had not received a letter which might perhaps have comforted him. In touch with cutlets, I felt how sorely he had needed comfort. And anon, by the big bright fireside of that small dark smoking-room where, a year ago, on the last evening of my stay here, he and I had at length spoken to each other, I reviewed in detail the tragic experience he had told me; and I simply reveled in reminiscent sympathy with him. A. V. LAIDER--I had looked him up in the visitors'-book on",0,0.0
"This post was written on Wednesday of this week, it just took me this long to get online. :) I will also say that this a very difficult post for me, since it deals with yet another ""personal"" failure for me, much to many of which I seem to have had of late. In the words of the slightly eccentricEdward Norton, ""On a long enough time line, everyone's probability of survival drops to ZERO"" ( Fight Club, 1999 ). In short, if you ""play"" long enough, at anything, you will eventually run out of luck. It is said that experience is a hell of a teacher: it gives the test first, and then the lesson. I can definitely attest to that. Irony is a real son-of-a-bitchtoo. So, if you are wonderg where this is going, here it is. I have been abusing some sort of substance, heavily, since beforeI can remember. I am an adrenaline junkie, and bored way to easily. Personally, I could give a fuck, and it does not bother me at all, only everyone else that chooses to, either through boredom or actual concern, let me know that I need to ""slow down"", and that apparently everything kills you eventually. That is arguable. Anyway, I went out to meet a friend for dinner, had a glass or 2 of wine one night, and then I stopped by a bar and had a couple beers and shot the shit (so to speak). This all happened over the course of about 4 hours. I felt fine. At any rate, on the way home, I was driving to fast, missed my exit because my brakes locked up, and high-centered my car on a guardrail at 100 miles an hour. I was fine and the car was amazingly fine also, just precariously situated on a guardrail. Pretty unnatural looking, so it did not take long for the Polizei to show up (German pigs-cops, for the layperson), and haul my ass off to jail. I guess there is a first time for everything. Now, before we all start jumping on the band wagon and crucify me for my stupidity, I would like to point out something. If any of you have ever had a drink, taken medication or driven while having less than the optimal/suggested 8 hours of sleep, then you could just as easily been arrested for driving while impaired, or driving under the influence. The ironic thing is this: every time you drive while impaired (tired, intoxicated, etc), you accept a certain level of risk. Having survived and lived through this experience several times, unscathed, the perceived level of risk becomes less and less. Eventually, your accepted level of risk is quite high, yet it appears to be quite low, because you have been through this so many times, without consequence. Let me be the first to say that I am full aware that I am very lucky to be alive, and very lucky that no one else was involved, or injured, and my dialogue is in no way meant to justify any actions. Rather it is meant to explore the thought process in respect to how we as humans allow ourselves and rationalize our way into situations that we detest, and that defy any form of logic....and by we, I mean me. I just happened to reach the end of my luck. Yes, it sucks. I have no license now, I am in trouble at work, and I have to tell everyone to fuck off and get a life on a much more regular basis, but what can you do? Regret is a waste of an emotion; a total and complete waste. What is the point of ruing over something you have no control over, and that is over anyway? I am inclined to believe that living life in either the past or the future is, in essence, an exercise in futility. All we are guaranteed is this moment right now- nothing more, not even this next word..there. Live and learn. To live and not learn would be a tragedy, but if you end your day having learned something more than you started off knowing, then you are better off than you were before. Unfortunately, experience is the only teacher that seems to make a lasting impression on me. So, I have been to see a shrink, ended up psycho-analyzing him into therapy, and am now back at work. I received no diagnosis, but was under the impression that they wanted to label as me as a ""functioning alcoholic"". What a cop-out. First of all, is there really such thing as a ""non-functioning"" alcoholic? Not for long, I bet. Also, if you are a ""functioning"" alcoholic, who really gives a fuck? There are plenty of people who are unable to function on any level, and do not even have a good excuse. So if you are functioning, who cares under what circumstances? Society is really pathetic in its assumptions of what is considered normal. Everyone is more than willing to place the blame on anyone or anything other than the person who is obviously responsible. Alcohol and drugs never ruined anyone's life; the moron under the influence of them ruined his own life- he just might have been high or drunk while he was doing it. On top of it all, the Air Force encourages and promotes this lifestyle, and then hammers you, at random, when things go south. So, as you can see, I have had a hell of a couple of weeks. On a positive note, it is only a year without a license, and I will have great legs after riding 10 miles a day round-trip to and from work... Seriously though, I enjoy it. Also, after many failed attempts, I have finally quit smoking- no cheating, no desire for it even. Bonus...:) I must say, however, that de-tox is a bitch. My lungs are hacking up all kinds of gunk in an effort to rejuvenate",0,0.0

This is going to be an ongoing post.. I'll work on it when I have time or come up with some lies... err facts to post about meself. A Hunnerd Thangs 1. I was born Wednesday, July 14, 1971. 2. Why, yes... I am from Texas! How did you guess?? 3. I've lived here all my life; but, I have always wanted to move to Louisiana, Mississippi, or points farther South (ok, technically east). 4. I am not a morning person. (or afternoon or evening, depending on when I am awakened) 5. I've been that way since I was a small child. I would stay up all night and then when my Momma would wake me up to go to school, I'd go into the bathroom and lock the door and fall asleep on the floor. 6. I have an above average IQ. But, when I was in the 5th grade I had the teacher from hell and decided I hated school and was never going to do any good at it. I somehow managed to succeed at that and yet graduated from high school and went on to take college courses. My opinion has changed drastically in the following years and I plan to finish my education. 7. When I was in the 4th grade, I spent a month in the hospital after I had an appendectomy and got a staph infection. They opened and closed the site four times before finally leaving it open to heal. I went home with a gaping wound and had to take baths in Tide. I have a four inch ugly scar to this day. 8. I got out of the hospital a couple of weeks before Halloween. That year I went trick or treating dressed as the Fat Farmer. In my Daddy's overalls stuffed with pillows. With boots that were too big. We went in my mom's best friends station wagon with a bunch of kids. I had to ride in the back and roll out at each stop and then roll back in later down the block. One stop I didn't roll in fast enough and was almost halfway in and they took off and I was left standing there. Fortunately, they came back for me. After a while. 9. Thanksgiving and Christmas are my favorite holidays now. 10. My favorite season is Fall. I love the smell of the air and the turning of the leaves and the cold weather coming on. 11. Fall means football season! I love football, have watched it with my Daddy since I was a little girl. 12. I also got a great love of cars from my Daddy. 13. I have a big nose, I got that from both sides of the family. But, it's mine, I'll keep it. 14. My feet are a size 10 and 1/2. 15. My eyes are gold around the pupil, blue-green in the middle and a dark blue-grey ring around the outside. They change color with my emotions. If they are bright green... watch yourself. 16. I am tone deaf and can't carry a tune in a bucket; but, I have a great love of music and am very attracted to musically inclined men. 17. My listening tastes range from classical to thrash metal, touching on everything in between. 18. I want a man who can sing to me (without me cringing). 19. I have a long list of what I am looking for in a man. Yes, written down. 20. I am a big list-maker. 21. I am good at losing them. 22. I love books. I'll read just about anything I can get my hands on. 23. I read Gone With the Wind for the first time when I was 13. 24. And Mandingo. And many, many other trashy novels. 25. I want a big ol' Southern house with a library. Painted red with dark wood. (the library not the house) 26. I have a real thang for a man with a Southern accent. (Yes, that is on the list.) 27. My love for all things Southern goes way back. I think it was all those bodice-ripping Civil War novels. 28. I'm a very good cook. 29. But, not of ""haute cuisine"". My specialty is ""down home"". 30. The smell of lilacs takes me back ""home"". 31. I spent my 21st birthday in Las Vegas. 32. I ate calamari for the first time in a fancy Italian restaurant there and had an anaphylactic reaction. 33. I am allergic to numerous things. Calamari (obviously), Penicillin, Sulfa, Macrodantin, and several other drugs. 34. When I was about 8 years old we were visiting my Granny Geneva. She had a large Magnolia tree in her front yard. I had never seen one and was fascinated by it. I plucked me a big, glossy, fragrant bloom and walked around sniffing it. After a while, I started to feel kind of funny and couldn't breathe so good so I went to tell my Momma and when I walked in the door both of them freaked out. My face and neck were grotesquely swollen and I was covered in red spots. Epinephrine is my friend. 35. I started smoking, drinking and getting high when I was about 13. Many years of this ensued until when I was 23 I started having allergic reactions to pot. Pot is not my friend. 36. I quit smoking, too. 37. I will still enjoy the occasional drink, but not to excess. 38. I was arrested once for Driving While Intoxicated. Funny thing is.... it was the ONE time that I",0,0.0
"Nikolai Gogol, a renowned Russian writer from the 19th century, is famous for his unique writing style and his keen observations of Russian society. His works often incorporate elements of satire, which he deftly employs to critique the flaws and idiosyncrasies of his contemporary society. Gogol's writing style is characterized by a blend of realism, dark humor, and surrealism, allowing him to explore complex themes such as identity, social inequality, and the struggle between appearance and reality.

One of Gogol's most prominent stylistic features is his use of satire. He masterfully employs satire to expose the contradictions and absurdities of Russian society during the time of his writing. In his collection of short stories, ""Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka,"" Gogol satirizes the rural Ukrainian society he grew up in by presenting exaggerated characters and situations. Through his satire, he highlights the deeply ingrained superstitions and irrational beliefs that permeate the lives of the villagers.

Gogol's satire extends beyond rural society to the urban setting as well. In his renowned novel, ""Dead Souls,"" he satirizes the corrupt bureaucracy of provincial Russia. The protagonist, Chichikov, travels from one town to another, purchasing dead serfs to exploit a legal loophole and acquire their ownership documents. Through this absurd plot, Gogol critiques the dehumanizing effects of a society driven by materialistic values. His portrayal of the landowners and officials who willingly participate in this unethical transaction reveals the moral decay and hypocrisy at the heart of Russian society.

Moreover, Gogol's writing style often veers towards the surreal and fantastical, blurring the boundaries between reality and imagination. In his short story, ""The Nose,"" he presents a bizarre tale of a government official waking up to find that his nose has mysteriously disappeared and has taken on a life of its own. This absurdist narrative allows Gogol to explore themes of identity crisis and social alienation. Through the protagonist's futile attempts to track down his nose, Gogol satirizes the obsession with social status and appearance, while also emphasizing the underlying emptiness and lack of individuality in Russian society.

Gogol's portrayal of Russian society reveals a deep understanding of its complexities and contradictions. He highlights the stark social divisions and the vast economic disparities between the different classes. In ""The Overcoat,"" Gogol tells the story of Akaky Akakievich, a low-ranking government clerk who becomes fixated on obtaining a new overcoat. The overcoat becomes a symbol of social status, highlighting the importance placed on material possessions and the lengths individuals will go to in order to be seen as respectable. Gogol's portrayal of Akaky's struggles and eventual tragic fate serves as a critique of the dehumanizing effects of a society that values appearances over human worth.

Furthermore, Gogol's writing style exhibits a strong sense of realism, as he vividly depicts the physical and social landscapes of Russia. He captures the harsh realities and stark contrasts of urban and rural life, portraying the poverty and desperation of the lower classes. Gogol's keen eye for detail and his ability to evoke a sense of place immerse the reader in the world he depicts.

In conclusion, Nikolai Gogol's writing style is characterized by a unique blend of satire, surrealism, and realism. Through his use of satire, he critiques the flaws and absurdities of Russian society, both rural and urban. His portrayal of societal divisions, the pursuit of material possessions, and the struggle between appearance and reality reflects his deep understanding of the complexities of Russian society. Gogol's works continue to be celebrated for their insightful social commentary and their lasting impact on Russian literature.",1,0.0
"Living in different cities across the United States has been an eye-opening experience for me. Each city has its own unique characteristics, lifestyle, and challenges that make it distinct from the others. As I've traveled and resided in various parts of the country, I've come to appreciate the diversity and contrast that exists within our borders.

Let me start with my first stop: New York City, the city that never sleeps. The fast-paced lifestyle and hustle and bustle of NYC are unparalleled. The energy that fills the air is contagious, and it's hard not to get caught up in the excitement of the city. From iconic landmarks like Times Square and Central Park to the vibrant arts scene in Brooklyn, there is always something happening in this concrete jungle.

However, living in New York City also comes with its challenges. The cost of living is exorbitant, and finding affordable housing can be a real struggle. The crowded subways during rush hour can be overwhelming, and the constant noise pollution can take a toll on one's mental well-being. But despite these challenges, there's a sense of pride that comes with being a New Yorker. The city offers endless opportunities and a melting pot of cultures that make it the cultural capital of the world.

Next, let's move across the country to San Francisco, California. The picturesque beauty of the Golden Gate Bridge and the rolling hills make San Francisco a dream destination. The city is known for its progressive and innovative spirit, with Silicon Valley just a stone's throw away. The tech industry has shaped the city's identity, attracting aspiring entrepreneurs and professionals from all over the world.

San Francisco's lifestyle is more laid-back compared to New York City. People here seem to prioritize work-life balance, spending their weekends hiking in nearby national parks or enjoying the local food scene. However, living in San Francisco is not without its challenges. The cost of living is sky-high, driven by the booming tech industry. Rent prices are astronomical, and affordable housing is increasingly scarce. Homelessness is also a prevalent issue in the city, highlighting the stark inequality that exists amidst the wealth and prosperity.

Moving on to a completely different part of the country, let's explore the city of New Orleans, Louisiana. New Orleans has a rich cultural heritage and is known for its vibrant music scene, delicious cuisine, and lively festivals like Mardi Gras. The city has an infectious charm that draws people in, and the locals have a strong sense of community.

New Orleans has a slower pace of life compared to the big cities of New York and San Francisco. People here take the time to savor their meals, engage in conversations with strangers, and truly embrace the joy of living. The architecture and historic neighborhoods add to the city's unique appeal. However, New Orleans faces its fair share of challenges, particularly when it comes to natural disasters like hurricanes. The city's vulnerability to flooding and the ongoing efforts to rebuild after Hurricane Katrina are constant reminders of the resilience and determination of its residents.

Lastly, let's venture into the heartland of America, to a city like Chicago, Illinois. Chicago is known for its stunning architecture, world-class museums, and deep-dish pizza. The city has a vibrant arts scene, with theaters, galleries, and music venues showcasing talent from all over.

Living in Chicago offers a balance between big-city amenities and a more relaxed lifestyle. The people here are friendly and welcoming, creating a sense of community despite the urban sprawl. However, the windy city also faces its own set of challenges. Harsh winters with biting cold winds are not for the faint of heart, and the high crime rates in some neighborhoods can be concerning.

In conclusion, life in different cities across the United States presents a fascinating tapestry of experiences. From the fast-paced lifestyle of New York City to the innovation and tech-driven culture of San Francisco, the charm of New Orleans, and the balance of big-city amenities and a relaxed lifestyle in Chicago, each city has its own unique flavor. These experiences have taught me to appreciate the diversity that exists within our country, and to embrace the challenges that come with living in different cities.",1,0.0
"Terri felt a chill creep up his spine as the old man's words sank in. His confidence began to waver, replaced by a nagging doubt. The old man's calm demeanor was unnerving, and it started to dawn on Terri that this encounter might not be as straightforward as he initially believed.

Immediately, Terri's mind raced, desperately searching for a way out of this predicament. His usual air of authority seemed to falter as he struggled to regain control of the situation. The realization that his life might truly be in danger unsettled him.

""What do you mean, 'are they'?"" Terri demanded, his voice trembling slightly. ""What have you done?""

The old man's smile widened, revealing yellowed teeth. ""You see, Terri Mac, you've been living in a world of illusions. Your power and influence have blinded you to the reality that surrounds you.""

Terri's heart pounded in his chest. His mind conjured up images of betrayal and conspiracy, fueling his growing sense of panic. How had he ended up in such a vulnerable position? He had always believed himself to be untouchable, protected by his position within the government.

""I don't understand,"" Terri stammered, his voice tinged with fear. ""Who are you? What is happening?""

The old man leaned forward, his eyes piercing into Terri's soul. ""I am merely the messenger, Terri Mac. You've made many enemies throughout your career, enemies who are now prepared to bring you down. Your shield cannot protect you from the people who once admired you, who now seek to expose your corruption and deceit.""

Terri's face paled as his worst fears were confirmed. He had played a dangerous game, amassing power and wealth at the expense of others. His past actions were catching up with him, and he realized that the walls that had once shielded him were crumbling around him.

Desperation fueled Terri's next move. ""What do you want from me?"" he pleaded, his voice quivering with a mix of fear and vulnerability. ""I can give you anything you want. Money, resources, protection. Just let me go.""

The old man chuckled, a sinister sound that sent shivers down Terri's spine. ""It's too late for bargains, Terri Mac. The wheels are already in motion. Your fate has been sealed, and no amount of wealth or power can save you now.""

Terri's mind raced, desperately searching for a way out of this dire situation. He knew he had to think quickly, but his fear and panic threatened to overwhelm him.

Suddenly, a glimmer of hope sparked within him. He remembered the emergency escape route that had been installed in his office. It was a hidden passage that only a select few knew about, a secret exit that could lead him to safety.

Gathering his courage, Terri focused on the old man, trying to hide the flicker of hope in his eyes. ""You may think you have won,"" he said, his voice steady and measured. ""But I will not go down without a fight. I have resources at my disposal that you cannot comprehend.""

The old man's smile faltered for a moment, replaced by a look of uncertainty. ""You underestimate me, Terri Mac,"" he said, his voice tinged with warning. ""But feel free to try and escape. The world outside may not be as forgiving as you hope.""

With a surge of determination, Terri stood up, using every ounce of remaining composure to maintain a facade of control. Ignoring the old man's warning, he walked deliberately towards the bookshelf on the far wall. With a swift motion, he pulled a hidden lever, revealing the secret door.

As the door swung open, Terri spared one last glance at the old man before disappearing into the darkness of the escape route. A mix of uncertainty and hope flooded through him, knowing that his destiny was still in his hands.

Little did he know, the old man's intentions were far more complex than Terri could have imagined. As the door closed behind Terri, the old man's smile returned, knowing that his true purpose had been fulfilled. Terri's fate had been set in motion, and he was merely a pawn in a much larger game.",1,0.0
"Rotational falls in eventing have long been a topic of concern in the equestrian community due to their potential for serious injuries and even fatalities. A rotational fall occurs when a horse hits an obstacle and flips over with the rider, often resulting in the horse landing on top of the rider. These falls can have devastating consequences for both horse and rider, and have spurred efforts to improve safety measures in the sport.

Although eventing is known for its thrilling nature, combining the disciplines of dressage, cross-country, and show jumping, the risk of rotational falls is something that cannot be ignored. According to a study published in the Equine Veterinary Journal in 2015, rotational falls make up only a small percentage of all falls in eventing, occurring in approximately 3% of cross-country jumps. However, their consequences are disproportionate, accounting for the majority of serious injuries and fatalities in the sport.

The potential consequences of a rotational fall are severe. For the rider, they may include broken bones, spinal cord injuries, or even death. Horses, too, can suffer catastrophic injuries such as broken limbs, internal bleeding, or severe head trauma. Unfortunately, there have been numerous high-profile cases where rotational falls have had tragic outcomes. In 2008, Olympic eventing competitor Darren Chiacchia suffered a spinal cord injury resulting from a rotational fall at the Red Hills Horse Trials. Another notable incident occurred at the 2010 Rolex Kentucky Three-Day Event, where a horse named Leprechaun's Row fell on top of rider Phillip Dutton, breaking his collarbone.

The occurrence of rotational falls has prompted eventing organizations and governing bodies to take action to improve safety in the sport. One significant step has been the introduction of collapsible obstacles. Traditional solid obstacles, such as logs or stone walls, had the potential to cause horse and rider to somersault on impact. The invention of collapsible obstacles, which give way upon impact, has significantly reduced the likelihood of a horse flipping over in a fall. By allowing the horse to pass through the obstacle, rather than being jolted to an abrupt halt, these collapsible fences help prevent the rotation that can result in a fall.

Furthermore, course designers have focused on creating more forgiving and horse-friendly cross-country courses. This involves carefully considering the placement and design of jumps to minimize the risk of rotational falls. For example, officials may set up combinations, where multiple fences must be negotiated in quick succession, to encourage a smoother and more flowing approach. Additionally, safety frangible pins and deformable technology have been introduced to reduce the impact of a horse hitting an obstacle, further minimizing the risk of a rotational fall.

There have also been advancements in safety equipment for riders, such as body protectors and helmets. These protective gear innovations aim to reduce the risk of serious injuries in the event of a fall. Eventing organizations have made it mandatory for riders to wear approved safety helmets, and many riders also choose to wear air vests, which inflate upon impact and provide additional protection to the spine and vital organs.

Despite these significant safety improvements, rotational falls continue to be a concern in eventing. The complexity and technicality of modern-day courses, coupled with the need for speed and agility, still pose challenges. In recent years, several high-profile events, including the 2018 World Equestrian Games, have seen rotational falls that resulted in serious injuries to both riders and horses.

To address these ongoing concerns, governing bodies and event organizers have responded with additional safety measures. The FEI, the international governing body for equestrian sports, has implemented stricter rules regarding the design and construction of cross-country courses. They have also increased the use of technology, such as video analysis and course simulation software, to assess the safety and feasibility of courses before events. Furthermore, mandatory safety seminars and educational programs are now available to both riders and officials, aiming to enhance safety awareness and reduce the occurrence of rotational falls.

In conclusion, rotational falls in eventing remain a significant safety concern for riders and horses alike. While they may constitute a small percentage of falls, their potential for catastrophic injuries and fatalities necessitates ongoing efforts to improve safety measures in the sport. The introduction of collapsible obstacles, improvements in course design, advancements in safety equipment, and the implementation of stricter rules and educational programs demonstrate a commitment to minimizing the risk of rotational falls in eventing. However, continued vigilance and innovation are essential to ensure the wellbeing of both human and equine athletes in this thrilling but inherently risky sport.",1,0.0

He told me that he had been reading several new novels and volumes of short stories by contemporary American writers with that awakened interest in the civilization we are framing which is so noticeable among English writers during the past three years. He asked me a remarkable question, and the answer which I gave him suggested certain contrasts which seemed to me of basic importance for us all. He said: ""I have been reading books by Sherwood Anderson, Waldo Frank and Ben Hecht and Konrad Bercovici and Joseph Hergesheimer, and I can see that they are important books, but I feel that the essential point to which all this newly awakened literary consciousness is tending has somehow subtly eluded me. American and English writers both use the same language, and so do Scotch and Irish writers, but I am not puzzled when I read Scotch and Irish books as I am when I read these new American books. Why is it?"" I had to think for a moment, and then the obvious answer occurred to me. I told him that I thought the reason for his moderate bewilderment was due to the fact that the Englishman or the Scotchman or the Irishman living at home was writing out of a background of racial memory and established tradition which was very much all of one piece, and that all such an artist's unspoken implications and subtleties could be easily taken for granted by his readers, and more or less thoroughly understood, because they were elements in harmony with a tolerably fixed and ordered world. I added that this was more or less true of the American writer up",0,0.0
"Caroline Wozniacki R[2] (Danish: [kʰɑʁoˈliːnə vʌsniˈɑkʰi]; born 11 July 1990) is a Danish professional tennis player. She was ranked world No. 1 in singles[3][4] for a total of 71 weeks, including at the end of 2010 and 2011. She achieved the top ranking for the first time on 11 October 2010, becoming the 20th player in the Open Era and the first from a Scandinavian country to hold the top position.[5] In 2018, she became the first Dane to win a major singles title at the Australian Open. Known for her footwork and defensive abilities, Wozniacki won 30 WTA Tour singles titles (including six in both 2010 and 2011, the most in a year by a WTA player from 2008–2011)[6] and two doubles titles. A junior major champion, she won the 2006 Wimbledon girls' singles title over Magdaléna Rybáriková and was voted the WTA Newcomer of the Year in 2008. Before her victory at the 2018 Australian Open over Simona Halep, she had reached two major finals at the US Open, falling to Kim Clijsters in 2009 and to Serena Williams in 2014. Wozniacki also won the season-ending WTA Finals in 2017, beating Venus Williams, after previously finishing runner-up to Clijsters at the event in 2010. Other career highlights include winning three Premier Mandatory and three Premier 5 titles, reaching four major semifinals (the 2011 Australian Open and the 2010, 2011 and 2016 US Opens, three major quarterfinals (the 2012 Australian Open and the 2010 and 2017 French Opens), and the quarterfinals at the 2012 London Olympics. Wozniacki retired on 24 January 2020, following a third-round loss at the Australian Open. She became an ESPN commentator in 2022.[7] In June 2023 she announced a comeback at the Canadian Open in August, targeting the US Open.[8] Wozniacki was born in Odense, Denmark. She is of Polish descent.[9][10] Her mother Anna played on the Polish women's national volleyball team,[11] and her father Piotr played professional football. The couple moved to Denmark when Piotr signed for the Danish football club B1909.[10][12] Her older brother, Patrik Wozniacki, is a former professional footballer in Denmark.[11] Wozniacki had a career-high junior ranking of No. 2 in the world. She made her debut on the ITF Junior Circuit, the premier 18-and-under junior tour that is run by the International Tennis Federation (ITF), in October 2003 at 13 years and 3 months old. During her first month, she entered two Grade 5 events in Denmark, the lowest-level tournament on the tour. Wozniacki reached the final at both singles events, winning the second over compatriot Hanne Skak Jensen. With this success, she moved up to Grade 3 and Grade 4 tournaments, winning her first four singles events of 2004. Her win streak of five tournaments and 27 matches came to an end in April with a semifinal loss to Latisha Chan at the International Juniors Championships in Manila, her first event outside of Scandinavia as well as her first Grade 1 event. From this point on, Wozniacki only competed in Grade A and Grade 1 events, the two highest-level tournaments. She made her Grade A debut at Wimbledon before turning 14, losing her first main draw match to Bojana Bobusic. Towards the end of the year, Wozniacki won her first Grade A title at the Osaka Mayor's Cup.[13][14] Wozniacki won several junior tournaments in 2005, including the Orange Bowl.[15] She made her debut on the WTA Tour at Cincinnati's Western & Southern Open on 19 July 2005, losing to the top-seeded and eventual champion Patty Schnyder in the first round. In the Nordic Light Open, her other WTA tournament of the year, she lost to Martina Suchá in the first round. In 2006, she was the top seed at the Australian Open (junior girls' singles), but lost the final to eighth-seeded Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. She was seeded second with partner Anna Tatishvili in the doubles tournament, but the pair was knocked out in the semifinals by the French-Italian pair of Alizé Cornet and Corinna Dentoni, who were seeded eighth. In February at the Memphis, she reached her first WTA Tour quarterfinal, beating Kristina Brandi and Ashley Harkleroad before losing to third-seeded Sofia Arvidsson of Sweden. Before Wimbledon Wozniacki won the Liverpool International Tennis Tournament, an exhibition tournament, beating Ashley Harkleroad in the final.[16] Later that year she was given a wildcard to the qualifying draw at Wimbledon, where she was beaten in the first round by Miho Saeki. However, Wozniacki went on to win the Wimbledon girls' singles title, beating Magdaléna Rybáriková in the final. In August, she reached another WTA Tour quarterfinal, this time at the Nordic Light Open in Stockholm. She defeated top-100 players Iveta Benešová and Eleni Daniilidou, then lost to eventual champion and third-seeded Zheng Jie. Wozniacki was seeded second in the US Open girls' singles. In the first round, she won the first set against Russian Alexandra Panova, but was disqualified in the second set for verbally abusing an umpire. Wozniacki was said to have used an expletive in referring to a linesman who made a disputed call.[17] However, on her blog, she claimed to have said ""take your sunglasses of [sic]"" and was mistaken for talking to the linesman, when she in fact was criticizing herself after the next point.[18] In her last junior tournament, the Osaka Mayor's Cup, she won both the girls' singles and doubles.[19] Her first title on the senior tour came in October when she won a $25k tournament in Istanbul by beating Tatjana Malek in the final. Wozniacki was set to face Venus Williams on 27 November in an exhibition match in Copenhagen,[20] but five days before the event, Williams cancelled because of an injury.[21] The two did, however, face each other in the Memphis WTA Tier III event on 20 February. Williams beat Wozniacki, ending a nine-match winning streak for Wozniacki. On 29 November Wozniacki was named ambassador for Danish Junior Tennis by the Culture Minister of Denmark at the time, Brian Mikkelsen.[22] On 4 February 2007, she",0,0.0
"In the heart of the Inner Lands, where time seems to stand still and nature unfolds her delicate symphony, lies a beauty so ethereal, so tranquil, that even the most weary of souls find solace within its embrace. Here, amidst rolling hills dotted with wildflowers, and forests adorned with ancient oaks, a sense of serenity prevails, bringing forth a harmonious coexistence between man and nature.

As the sun rises, casting its golden hues upon the landscape, the morning mist delicately rises from the meandering River Oriathon, glistening like silver threads in the early light. The river weaves its way through the gentle valleys, its soft murmurs weaving tales of forgotten times and distant lands. The people of the Inner Lands believe that the river, the lifeblood of their existence, flows from the heart of the Earth itself, carrying with it the whispers of ancient wisdom.

But despite their deep connection to the River Oriathon, there is a longing within the hearts of the inhabitants of the Inner Lands - a longing for something beyond the rolling hills and verdant forests. A longing for the boundless expanse of the Sea, whose call they hear in the gentle rustle of leaves and the breath of the wind.

Legends and tales have been woven around the Sea, as old as time itself. Stories of mermaids with voices so enchanting that sailors are lured to their watery depths, and tales of mythical sea creatures that frolic amidst the waves. But beyond the mythical allure, there is a deeper connection that the people of the Inner Lands feel towards the Sea.

It is said that the Sea and the River Oriathon are intertwined, bound by a mystical bond that stretches beyond the comprehension of mortals. The Sea, with its vastness and mystery, whispers secrets to the River, which in turn carries those secrets to the waiting ears of those who dwell in the Inner Lands.

The inhabitants of these lands believe that the Sea holds the answers to the questions that haunt their souls, that it holds the key to their desires and dreams. They yearn to feel the cool kiss of the salty breeze on their cheeks, to be mesmerized by the ebb and flow of the tides, and to lose themselves in the infinite shades of blue that stretch beyond the horizon.

For the Sea represents an untamed freedom, a wildness that beckons to their spirits, urging them to transcend the boundaries of their existence. It is a reminder that life is not meant to be confined to the gentle rhythm of the Inner Lands alone, but rather to embrace the vastness and immensity of the world beyond.

And so, the inhabitants of the Inner Lands find solace in the longing for the Sea, for it is in that longing that they find a connection to something greater than themselves. It is a bittersweet yearning, a dance between contentment and restlessness, as they strive to find a balance between the tranquility of their home and the wild allure of the Sea.

But perhaps, deep within their souls, they know that the beauty and tranquility of the Inner Lands could never truly exist without the whispers and echoes of the Sea. It is the longing for the unknown, the yearning for something beyond the visible horizon, that breathes life into their existence and keeps the flame of their dreams burning bright.

And so, with each passing day, as the sun sets over the rolling hills and the stars paint the sky with their ethereal glow, the people of the Inner Lands continue to listen to the rhythm of the River Oriathon, and they hold onto the promise that one day, they might answer the Sea's call and venture beyond their peaceful haven, to immerse themselves in the majesty and wonder of the boundless Sea.",1,0.0
"Title: An Introspective Look into Drinking Games: A Journey through History and Fun

Introduction:
Drinking games have been a part of social gatherings around the world for centuries, adding an element of excitement and camaraderie to the tradition of enjoying alcoholic beverages. These games come in various forms and have evolved over time, as different cultures have added their own unique twists and rules. This article will explore the history of drinking games, the different types that exist, and provide examples of popular games along with their distinct features.

I. The History of Drinking Games:
Drinking games can be traced back to ancient civilizations where they were often associated with rituals and celebrations. Some early examples include the Ancient Greek game ""Kottabos,"" where players would fling the dregs of their wine at a target, and the Romans' ""Tutilimundi,"" where participants had to guess the outcome of dice rolls while intoxicated. These early forms of drinking games were not only sources of entertainment but also played a significant role in social bonding.

II. Types of Drinking Games:
1. Skill-based Games:
   - Beer Pong: This classic American game involves throwing a ping pong ball across a table, aiming to land it in cups filled with beer. Players plan their throws strategically, and the opposing team drinks the contents of the cups when a ball successfully lands.
   - Quarters: Participants take turns trying to bounce a quarter off the table and into a shot glass. If successful, the assigned person must drink the contents of the glass.

2. Card-based Games:
   - Kings: Using a standard deck of cards, each card has a specific rule, commonly associated with drinking. For example, drawing an Ace could make the player choose someone to drink, while a King could establish a ""waterfall"" effect, where all players must continue drinking until the person to their right stops.
   - Ring of Fire: Players take turns drawing cards, and the cards are associated with specific actions or rules. For example, drawing a 3 could lead to a ""thumb master"" who places their thumb on the table, and all other players must follow suit. The last person to do so drinks.

3. Dice-based Games:
   - Mexican Dice: Players roll two dice, and the outcome corresponds to a specific rule. For instance, if a player rolls a double 1, they must drink a shot, while rolling a double 6 allows them to assign drinks to another player.
   - Ship, Captain, Crew: In this game, players roll five dice, aiming to get a ""Ship"" (6), ""Captain"" (5), and ""Crew"" (4). Once achieved, the player can assign drinks or make others participate in challenges.

III. Unique Features of Popular Drinking Games:
1. Physical Challenges:
   - Flip Cup: Players compete in teams, each with a plastic cup filled with beer. The objective is to drink the contents of the cup and then successfully flip it over using only one hand, using the rim to make it land upside down on the table. First team to finish wins.

2. Trivia and Knowledge:
   - Drunk Jenga: Traditional Jenga blocks are written with unique rules or challenges. Players must complete the task written on the block before placing it back on top of the tower.

3. Strategy and Risk:
   - Drunk Chess: Similar to regular chess, the twist is that every time a player loses a piece, they must take a sip of their drink. It adds an element of distraction and requires careful thinking.

Conclusion:
Drinking games have a long and rich history, with various types and unique features that cater to different preferences and social dynamics. From skill-based games like Beer Pong and Quarters to card-based games like Kings and Ring of Fire, and even dice-based games like Mexican Dice and Ship, Captain, Crew, these games provide enjoyable moments and enhance bonding among friends. Whether played at house parties, bars, or casual gatherings, drinking games continue to be a fun and interactive tradition that transcends cultures and generations, bringing people together with laughter, competition, and shared experiences.",1,0.0
"as the Scarecrow, Jack Pumpkinhead, Tiktok the Clockwork Man, the Tin Woodman, the Wizard of Oz, the Shaggy Man and other famous fairy people. Little Dorothy usually has a seat at Ozma's feet, and crouched on either side the throne are two enormous beasts known as the Hungry Tiger and the Cowardly Lion. [Illustration] These two beasts are Ozma's chief guardians, but as everyone loves the beautiful girl Princess there has never been any disturbance in the great Throne Room, or anything for the guardians to do but look fierce and solemn and keep quiet until the Royal Audience is over and the people go away to their homes. Of course no one would dare be naughty while the huge Lion and Tiger crouched beside the throne; but the fact is, the people of Oz are very seldom naughty. So Ozma's big guards are more ornamental than useful, and no one realizes that better than the beasts themselves. One day, after everybody had left the Throne Room except the Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger, the Lion yawned and said to his friend: ""I'm getting tired of this job. No one is afraid of us and no one pays any attention to us."" ""That is true,"" replied the big Tiger, purring softly. ""We might as well be in the thick jungles where we were born, as trying to protect Ozma when she needs no protection. And I'm dreadfully hungry all the time."" ""You have enough to eat, I'm sure,"" said the Lion, swaying his tail slowly back and forth. ""Enough, perhaps; but not the kind of food I long for,"" answered the Tiger. ""What I'm hungry for is fat babies. I have a great desire to eat a few fat babies. Then, perhaps, the people of Oz would fear me and I'd become more important."" [Illustration] ""True,"" agreed the Lion. ""It would stir up quite a rumpus if you ate but _one_ fat baby. As for myself; my claws are sharp as needles and strong as crowbars, while my teeth are powerful enough to tear a person to pieces in a few seconds. If I should spring upon a man and make chop suey of him, there would be wild excitement in the Emerald City and the people would fall upon their knees and beg me for mercy. That, in my opinion, would render me of considerable importance."" ""After you had torn the person to pieces, what would you do next?"" asked the Tiger sleepily. ""Then I would roar so loudly it would shake the earth and stalk away to the jungle to hide myself, before anyone could attack me or kill me for what I had done."" ""I see,"" nodded the Tiger. ""You are really cowardly."" ""To be sure. That is why I am named the Cowardly Lion. That is why I have always been so tame and peaceable. But I'm awfully tired of being tame,"" added the Lion, with a sigh, ""and it would be fun to raise a row and show people what a terrible beast I really am."" The Tiger remained silent for several minutes, thinking deeply as he slowly washed his face with his left paw. Then he said: ""I'm getting old, and it would please me to eat at least one fat baby before I die. Suppose we surprise these people of Oz and prove our power. What do you say? We will walk out of here just as usual and the first baby we meet I'll eat in a jiffy, and the first man or woman you meet you will tear to pieces. Then we will both run out of the city gates and gallop across the country and hide in the jungle before anyone can stop us."" ""All right; I'm game,"" said the Lion, yawning again so that he showed two rows of dreadfully sharp teeth. The Tiger got up and stretched his great, sleek body. ""Come on,"" he said. The Lion stood up and proved he was the larger of the two, for he was almost as big as a small horse. Out of the palace they walked, and met no one. They passed through the beautiful grounds, past fountains and beds of lovely flowers, and met no one. Then they unlatched a gate and entered a street of the city, and met no one. ""I wonder how a fat baby will taste,"" remarked the Tiger, as they stalked majestically along, side by side. ""I imagine it will taste like nutmegs,"" said the Lion. ""No,"" said the Tiger, ""I've an idea it will taste like gumdrops."" They turned a corner, but met no one, for the people of the Emerald City were accustomed to take their naps at this hour of the afternoon. ""I wonder how many pieces I ought to tear a person into,"" said the Lion, in a thoughtful voice. ""Sixty would be about right,"" suggested the Tiger. [Illustration] ""Would that hurt any more than to tear one into about a dozen pieces?"" inquired the Lion, with a little shudder. ""Who cares whether it hurts or not?"" growled the Tiger. The Lion did not reply. They entered a side street, but met no one. Suddenly they heard a child crying. ""Aha!"" exclaimed the Tiger. ""There is my meat."" He rushed around a corner, the Lion following, and came upon a nice fat baby sitting in the middle of the street and crying as if in great distress. ""What's the matter?"" asked the Tiger, crouching before the baby. ""I--I--I-lost my m-m-mamma!"" wailed the baby. ""Why, you poor little thing,"" said the great beast, softly stroking the child's head with its paw. ""Don't cry, my dear, for mamma can't be far away and I'll help you to find her."" ""Go on,"" said the Lion, who stood by. ""Go on where?"" asked the Tiger, looking up. ""Go on and eat your fat baby."" ""Why, you dreadful creature!"" said the Tiger reproachfully; ""would you want me to eat a poor little lost baby,",0,0.0
"Patience; or, Bunthorne's Bride, is a comic opera in two acts with music by Arthur Sullivan and libretto by W. S. Gilbert. The opera is a satire on the aesthetic movement of the 1870s and '80s in England and, more broadly, on fads, superficiality, vanity, hypocrisy and pretentiousness; it also satirises romantic love, rural simplicity and military bluster. First performed at the Opera Comique, London, on 23 April 1881, Patience moved to the 1,292-seat Savoy Theatre on 10 October 1881, where it was the first theatrical production in the world to be lit entirely by electric light. Henceforth, the Gilbert and Sullivan comic operas would be known as the Savoy Operas, and both fans and performers of Gilbert and Sullivan would come to be known as ""Savoyards."" Patience was the sixth operatic collaboration of fourteen between Gilbert and Sullivan. It ran for a total of 578 performances, which was seven more than the authors' earlier work, H.M.S. Pinafore, and the second longest run of any work of musical theatre up to that time, after the operetta Les Cloches de Corneville.[1] The opera is a satire on the aesthetic movement of the 1870s and '80s in England, part of the 19th-century European movement that emphasised aesthetic values over moral or social themes in literature, fine art, the decorative arts, and interior design. Called ""Art for Art's Sake"", the movement valued its ideals of beauty above any pragmatic concerns.[2] Although the output of poets, painters and designers was prolific, some argued that the movement's art, poetry and fashion was empty and self-indulgent.[3][4] That the movement was so popular and also so easy to ridicule as a meaningless fad helped make Patience a big hit. The same factors made a hit out of The Colonel, a play by F. C. Burnand based partly on the satiric cartoons of George du Maurier in Punch magazine. The Colonel beat Patience to the stage by several weeks, but Patience outran Burnand's play. According to Burnand's 1904 memoir, Sullivan's friend the composer Frederic Clay leaked to Burnand the information that Gilbert and Sullivan were working on an ""æsthetic subject"", and so Burnand raced to produce The Colonel before Patience opened.[5][6] Modern productions of Patience have sometimes updated the setting of the opera to an analogous era such as the hippie 1960s, making a flower-child poet the rival of a beat poet.[7] The two poets in the opera are given to reciting their own verses aloud, principally to the admiring chorus of rapturous maidens. The style of poetry Bunthorne declaims strongly contrasts with Grosvenor's. The former's, emphatic and obscure, bears a marked resemblance to Swinburne's poetry in its structure, style and heavy use of alliteration.[8] The latter's ""idyllic"" poetry, simpler and pastoral, echoes elements of Coventry Patmore and William Morris.[9] Gilbert scholar Andrew Crowther comments, ""Bunthorne was the creature of Gilbert's brain, not just a caricature of particular Aesthetes, but an original character in his own right.""[10] The makeup and costume adopted by the first Bunthorne, George Grossmith, used Swinburne's velvet jacket, the painter James McNeill Whistler's hairstyle and monocle, and knee-breeches like those worn by Oscar Wilde and others.[11] According to Gilbert's biographer Edith Browne, the title character, Patience, was made up and costumed to resemble the subject of a Luke Fildes painting.[12] Patience was not the first satire of the aesthetic movement played by Richard D'Oyly Carte's company at the Opera Comique. Grossmith himself had written a sketch in 1876 called Cups and Saucers that was revived as a companion piece to H.M.S. Pinafore in 1878, which was a satire of the blue pottery craze.[13] A popular misconception holds that the central character of Bunthorne, a ""Fleshly Poet,"" was intended to satirise Oscar Wilde, but this identification is retrospective.[10] According to some authorities, Bunthorne is inspired partly by the poets Algernon Charles Swinburne and Dante Gabriel Rossetti, who were considerably more famous than Wilde in early 1881 before Wilde published his first volume of poetry.[10] Rossetti had been attacked for immorality by Robert Buchanan (under the pseudonym ""Thomas Maitland"") in an article called ""The Fleshly School of Poetry"", published in The Contemporary Review for October 1871, a decade before Patience.[14] Nonetheless, Wilde's biographer Richard Ellmann suggests that Wilde is a partial model for both Bunthorne and his rival Grosvenor.[11] Carte, the producer of Patience, was also Wilde's booking manager in 1881 as the poet's popularity took off. In 1882, after the New York production of Patience opened, Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte sent Wilde on a US lecture tour, with his green carnation and knee-breeches, to explain the English aesthetic movement, intending to help popularise the show's American touring productions.[10][15] Although a satire of the aesthetic movement is dated today, fads and hero-worship are evergreen, and ""Gilbert’s pen was rarely sharper than when he invented Reginald Bunthorne"".[2] Gilbert originally conceived Patience as a tale of rivalry between two curates and of the doting ladies who attended upon them. The plot and even some of the dialogue were lifted straight out of Gilbert's Bab Ballad ""The Rival Curates."" While writing the libretto, however, Gilbert took note of the criticism he had received for his very mild satire of a clergyman in The Sorcerer, and looked about for an alternative pair of rivals. Some remnants of the Bab Ballad version do survive in the final text of Patience. Lady Jane advises Bunthorne to tell Grosvenor: ""Your style is much too sanctified – your cut is too canonical!"" Later, Grosvenor agrees to change his lifestyle by saying, ""I do it on compulsion!"" – the very words used by the Reverend Hopley Porter in the Bab Ballad. Gilbert's selection of aesthetic poet rivals proved to be a fertile subject for topsy-turvy treatment. He both mocks and joins in Buchanan's criticism of what the latter calls the poetic ""affectations"" of the ""fleshly school"" – their use of archaic terminology, archaic rhymes, the refrain, and especially their ""habit of accenting the last syllable in words which in ordinary speech are accented on the",0,0.0
"In 2006, Taiwan witnessed a significant political movement known as the Million Voices against Corruption campaign. This movement aimed to pressure President Chen Shui-bian to resign, highlighting the widespread allegations of corruption against him and his family. The campaign drew attention to the deep political divide in Taiwan and sparked a heated debate about the future of the country.

President Chen Shui-bian, a member of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), was first elected in 2000, becoming Taiwan's first non-Kuomintang president. Throughout his presidency, Chen faced numerous allegations of corruption and scandals, which greatly undermined his popularity and legitimacy. The accusations ranged from money laundering and embezzlement to bribery and improper use of government funds. Many members of the opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), and a significant portion of the public believed that Chen and his family were involved in various corrupt activities.

The origins of the campaign can be traced back to former Chairman of the Democratic Progressive Party, Shih Ming-teh. Shih, who had previously been a close ally of Chen, became disillusioned with his former comrade and decided to take a stand against the alleged corruption. Shih's involvement in the movement lent it credibility and support from within the DPP itself, further highlighting the divide within the party.

The campaign gained traction when Shih announced his intention to launch a hunger strike in front of the presidential office building in Taipei. This announcement sparked widespread public interest, and supporters began to gather to voice their dissatisfaction with the president. On September 9, 2006, the campaign officially began with a massive demonstration in front of the presidential office, where Shih and his supporters called for President Chen's resignation.

The demonstration attracted a diverse range of participants, including politicians, celebrities, and members of civil society. Notable figures such as Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who later became president, and rock musician Wu Bai joined the campaign, further increasing its visibility and impact. The participation of these prominent figures demonstrated the growing discontent with President Chen's leadership and the belief that his alleged corruption had tarnished Taiwan's image.

The Million Voices against Corruption movement utilized various tactics to put pressure on President Chen and his government. In addition to the hunger strike, supporters organized rallies, concerts, and public forums to raise awareness about the corruption allegations. The movement also established a committee responsible for coordinating its activities, recruiting volunteers, and communicating its message to the public.

Despite the significant support and momentum behind the campaign, President Chen remained defiant and refused to resign. He maintained that the allegations against him and his family were politically motivated and baseless. The divide between supporters and opponents of the president deepened, leading to increased polarization within Taiwanese society.

In the end, the Million Voices against Corruption campaign did not achieve its immediate goal of ousting President Chen from office. However, it succeeded in raising awareness about the allegations of corruption and the need for transparent and accountable governance in Taiwan. The movement also played a crucial role in shaping the political landscape in Taiwan, contributing to the eventual victory of the Kuomintang in the 2008 presidential election.

The Million Voices against Corruption campaign will be remembered as a pivotal moment in Taiwan's political history. It demonstrated the power of public opinion in shaping the political discourse and highlighted the importance of holding leaders accountable for their actions. The allegations of corruption against President Chen and his family, as well as the widespread public outrage, served as a wake-up call for Taiwanese society, leading to a renewed focus on transparency and good governance in the years that followed.",1,-1.0
"Esperanza, officially the Municipality of Esperanza, is a 5th class municipality in the province of Masbate, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 17,534 people.[4] About 60% of the population lives along the coastline, most of whom are fishermen. It is about 4 hours travel south of Masbate City with some roads and highways still undeveloped. Esperanza has several beaches, among them Gamay Na Baybay Beach, Talisay (Punta) Beach and Manok Manok Beach. Esperanza is a predominantly Cebuano speaking municipality, with a majority of its settlers tracing their ancestries from northern Cebu, particularly from Bogo. Esperanza is one of the four municipalities which are predominantly Cebuano speaking in the province of Masbate. People in the 1970s to early 1990s were heavily dependent on the water resources in the so-called Kapayawan, which means ""deep well"". It is the only safe water source for the majority of the people living in the area. In 2000, Esperanza was finally connected to the electricity grid supplied by MASELCO which benefited 80% of the households in the area. In 2006, President Gloria Arroyo defined Esperanza to be the most accessible town in Masbate going to Samar, Leyte and Cebu. That is the primary reason why the National Government constructed the port to serve as a roll-on/roll-off (RORO) gateway. The RORO vessels coming from Masbate docks at the RORO Port located at Barangay Polambato, Bogo, Cebu. Esperanza is about Four (4) hours land travel South from Masbate City, the last municipality in the south located between Placer in north-west and Pio V Corpus in southeast and considered as among the smallest in the island. Esperanza was initially one of the barangays of the town of Placer. In early 1915, a group of first settlers [Conag, Arabis, Pelayo and Serafin families] sailed from northern Cebu using their paddled banca and settled the place. The settlers actively cultivated the area into a productive agricultural community, developing the place until eventually called “Halabangbaybay”. Halabangbaybay means [Long Beach], due to its elongated shoreline and white fine sand. Halabangbaybay at that era was a green-mountainous forest community. It was not recognized as a barrio or even a mere sitio. In the 1940s, Halabangbaybay became a sitio of the barrio Alegria in Cataingan. Soon after, it was converted into a barrio named Esperanza as a barangay of Placer in 1948 (the year the barrio Placer was separated from Cataingan and constituted as its own municipality) and Pablo M. Conag served as the “teniente del Barrio”. The name Esperanza means ""Hope"" in reference to the first group of migrants in 1915 who hoped for a better life by settling on the present day area of Esperanza. In the mid-1950s, Lawyer Alfonso E. Conag [One of the sons of Felimon Serafin Conag] initiated vigorously and pursued for the conversion of Esperanza into an independent municipality. Esperanza officially became an independent municipality on by virtue of Executive Order No. 337 of May 7, 1959.[6] On July 2, 1959, the set of municipal officials started to hold office and Santos Edem Conag, the eldest son of Felimo Serafin Conag, became the first elected mayor. As of August 1, 2007, Esperanza has a total population of 16,834 according to National Statistic Office data. Esperanza is politically subdivided into 20 barangays. [7] Each barangay consists of puroks and some have sitios. There are 11 barangays which located along the coastal line and nine in farm areas with an estimated of seventy 70% of the population belongs to the fisher folks. Weather in Esperanza is generally divided into two seasonal weather patterns known locally as the Amihan and Habagat seasons. In the Tagalog language, Amihan means a cool north-east wind, and Habagat means west or south-west wind; south-west monsoon. Amihan and Habagat seasons are generally associated respectively with the El Niño and La Niña global weather patterns. The Amihan season is characterized by moderate temperatures, little or no rainfall, and a prevailing wind from the east. The Habagat season is characterized by hot and humid weather, frequent heavy rainfall, and a prevailing wind from the west. On Esperanza, the main indicator of the switch between the Amihan and Habagat seasonal patterns is the switch in wind direction. In most years this transition is abrupt and occurs overnight. In some years there is a period of perhaps a week or two where the wind will switch between Amihan and Habagat patterns several times before settling into the pattern for the new season. As a rule of thumb, Labangtatay will be in the Habagat weather pattern from sometime in September or October to sometime in May or June and in the Amihan weather pattern for the remainder of the year. These dates can vary in individual years, though. Daytime temperatures on Esperanza generally range from 77 to 90 °F (25-32 °C) from the beginning of the Amihan season into February or March, increase to the 82-100 °F (28-38 °C) range until the onset of the Habagat season, and moderate back to the 77-90 °F (25-32 °C) range with the return of the Amihan season.[8] During Tropical Storm periods, temperatures can fall below 68 °F (20 °C). Tropical Storms can impact Esperanza at any time of year, but are most likely to be seen during the Habagat season. In the 2020 census, the population of Esperanza, Masbate, was 17,534 people,[4] with a density of 260 inhabitants per square kilometre or 670 inhabitants per square mile. In Esperanza, the two main modes of transport are via motor-tricycles along the main road or by walking along the beaches. Pedicabs are also available for transport along the beachfront path. Other means of transportation include mountain bikes, quad bikes, and motorbikes, all of which can be rented. To explore around the island's coast, motorized bancas and sailing paraws are available for rent. These are outrigger canoes and are a common sight in waters around the island. The sailing paraw is a narrow hulled boat with outriggers on either side and with passengers",0,0.0
"I woke up that morning feeling a little mischievous, like I was ready to embrace the unexpected. So when I decided to head out for a spontaneous shopping trip, I decided to add a twist to make things a little more exciting. I decided not to wear any panties.

As I walked into the bustling mall, I could feel a surge of anticipation coursing through me. It was exhilarating, knowing that I had this little secret that no one else was aware of. It was like I held the key to a hidden world of fun and flirtation.

I strolled into the first store, the sound of my heels clicking on the polished mall floors. As I browsed through the racks, I couldn't help but notice the amused glances from some of the male shoppers. Were they suspicious? Or had they somehow sensed my little secret?

As I picked out a few outfits to try on, I strategically made sure to brush against a handsome man who was browsing through the same section. I caught his eye and flashed him a sly smile. He seemed taken aback at first but quickly regained his composure, returning my smile with a hint of playfulness.

""What do you think about this one?"" I asked, holding up a dress against my body, my voice dripping with mischief. He glanced at the dress and then back at me, a mischievous twinkle in his eye.

""I think it would look absolutely stunning on you,"" he replied, his voice matching mine in playful tone. I could feel the heat rising to my cheeks, a combination of the risqué situation and the undeniable chemistry between us.

I sauntered into the fitting room, feeling his gaze on me as I closed the door. As I slipped out of my jeans and blouse, I couldn't help but giggle at the thought of the secret I held underneath. I slipped the dress on, feeling the smooth fabric graze against my bare skin, heightening my senses.

Stepping out of the fitting room, I was greeted with the sight of the handsome man waiting just outside, an unmistakable glint of desire in his eyes. I twirled in the dress, reveling in the attention I was receiving, enjoying the game we were playing.

Before long, we were engaged in a delightful banter, our words laced with a flirtatious edge. I could feel the electricity between us, crackling in the air like a forbidden secret. Every interaction, every touch was amplified by the fact that I had chosen to leave my panties at home.

As we continued to explore the mall, stepping into different stores, our connection grew stronger. We laughed, we flirted, and we indulged in the thrill of the unexpected. The shopping trip had become a whimsical adventure, turning the ordinarily mundane into a playground of excitement.

At one point, as we strolled through a lingerie store, I couldn't resist teasing him further. I held up a lacy pair of panties, pretending to contemplate trying them on. His eyes widened, a mixture of surprise and excitement dancing in them. I winked, placing the panties back on the rack, leaving him yearning for more.

As the day drew to a close, we found ourselves sitting at a café in the mall, sipping our coffees and sharing laughter. The connection we had forged through our playful interactions had transformed into something real, something that extended beyond the boundaries of a lighthearted shopping adventure.

As we prepared to leave, exchanging numbers and promising to meet again, I couldn't help but feel a sense of delight and contentment. My spontaneous shopping trip had turned into a memorable experience, one that reminded me of the joy that comes from embracing the unexpected, even in the most mundane activities.

And as I walked out of the mall, feeling a gentle breeze against my bare skin, I knew that this day would forever be etched in my memory as a reminder of the power of spontaneity and the thrill of embracing the unexpected.",1,0.0
"Title: A Critical Reflection on ""Mastering C: Unveiling the Depths of Programming""

Introduction:

As an avid programmer, I recently had the opportunity to dive into the book ""Mastering C: Unveiling the Depths of Programming."" It promised to be a comprehensive guide to C programming, a language renowned for its efficiency and power. Being an intermediate-level C programmer myself, I eagerly embarked on this literary journey, hoping to deepen my understanding of the language and refine my skills. However, after careful consideration, I feel compelled to offer a critical review of this book, incorporating both technical observations and personal reflections of my own experiences.

Technical Critique:

One aspect that immediately caught my attention was the book's treatment of macros, a powerful feature of the C language. While the author did provide an overview of macros, I found the coverage to be lacking in depth. Macros, being a double-edged sword, require careful handling due to their potential pitfalls such as code bloat and unexpected behavior. Unfortunately, this book merely scratched the surface of macro usage, missing the opportunity to guide readers on best practices and potential alternatives to macros in certain scenarios. A more comprehensive exploration of this topic would have greatly enriched the readers' understanding and ability to write robust and maintainable code.

Additionally, the book's organization left much to be desired. It presented various C programming concepts in a disjointed and haphazard manner, failing to build a coherent foundation upon which subsequent topics could be seamlessly integrated. While the book did cover essential aspects, such as pointers, arrays, and structures, it lacked a cohesive narrative that would facilitate the reader's comprehension of how these concepts interconnect. This lack of structure often left me flipping back and forth between pages, struggling to piece together the bigger picture and connect the dots.

Personal Reflections:

Aside from the technical shortcomings, I also feel compelled to share my reflections on the author's attitude towards online interactions and work experiences. Throughout the book, the author repeatedly underscored the importance of engaging with online programming communities, seeking advice, and contributing to the collective knowledge pool. While this sentiment is commendable, I couldn't help but notice a dismissive tone in the author's portrayal of online interactions. As someone who has benefited immensely from online programming communities, I found this depiction disheartening. It is essential to embrace the vast network of knowledge-sharing available online and recognize the value of diverse perspectives that can enhance our learning and growth.

Another point that struck a chord with me was the author's emphasis on the importance of gaining real-world experience. While this is undoubtedly true and applicable to all fields, this notion was presented without acknowledging the barriers faced by aspiring programmers, such as limited access to internships or the need to balance work and study commitments. It would have been valuable for the author to include alternative avenues through which readers can gain practical experience, such as participating in open-source projects or contributing to coding challenges, thereby addressing the challenges faced by a broader range of readers.

Conclusion:

""Mastering C: Unveiling the Depths of Programming"" falls short of its potential. While it covers some fundamental topics related to C programming, the book fails to explore macros in sufficient depth and lacks a cohesive structure, hindering the reader's assimilation of knowledge. Moreover, the author's dismissive attitude towards online interactions and the limited perspective on work experiences undermines the book's overall message. As developers, we must recognize the importance of continual learning and appreciating the diverse avenues through which we can grow our skills. While ""Mastering C"" has its merits, it pales in comparison to the more comprehensive and well-rounded resources available on C programming. As readers, let's strive for a deeper understanding of the language by seeking multiple sources and embracing the vast opportunities for learning and collaboration that exist both offline and online.",1,0.0
"Max Alben took the sealed metal cylinder from Secretary-General Sadha with trembling hands. Its weight felt heavier than it appeared, symbolizing the immense responsibility that now rested on his shoulders. He knew that the contents of this cylinder held the key to his success, and possibly the fate of humanity.

As he walked towards the time-travel machine, Max couldn't help but think about the potential consequences of altering history. He had read countless stories and watched movies about time travelers changing the past and inadvertently causing catastrophic events in the present. The butterfly effect was always present in these narratives, reminding him that the smallest alteration could have unforeseen and far-reaching consequences.

Max wondered if the world he was about to enter would be drastically different from the one he knew. Would his actions prevent the Blight, or would they unleash an even greater disaster? Despite his fears, he knew he had no choice but to proceed. He had been chosen for this mission, and the lives of millions depended on his success.

As he stepped into the time-travel machine, Max glanced back at the powerful men on the couches, their gaze fixated on him. Their expectations were high, and he couldn't afford to disappoint them. The lives of countless generations were at stake, and Max understood that his decisions would shape the course of history.

The machine hummed to life around him, and Max felt a surge of energy enveloping his body. The coils glowed with a vibrant intensity, and the energy bubble expanded, obscuring his view of the laboratory. Time seemed to stand still as Max prepared himself for the unknown journey that lay ahead.

In the blink of an eye, Max found himself standing in front of the remote-control station in 1976. The air was thick with tension, the sounds of machinery and voices echoing in his ears. He quickly opened the sealed metal cylinder Secretary-General Sadha had given him, revealing a set of detailed instructions.

Max carefully followed the instructions, ensuring that every step was executed flawlessly. He knew that the success of his mission hinged on his ability to deftly manipulate the course of events without altering the timeline irreparably. It was a delicate dance, balancing the desire to prevent the Blight with the need to maintain the integrity of history.

As he approached the red switch, Max hesitated for a moment. The weight of the decision pressed upon him. Was he really about to alter the course of history? Would the world he returned to be unrecognizable?

But Max remembered the desperate faces of the people he had seen in his time—struggling, suffering, and on the brink of collapse. The Blight had ravaged the world, leaving nothing but chaos and destruction in its wake. He couldn't allow that reality to persist.

With a steady hand, Max pulled the red switch, redirecting the missile's explosion to the mid-Pacific. A sense of relief washed over him, knowing that he had prevented the Blight. But as the mission's success settled in, so did a new wave of uncertainty.

Max knew that his actions would have consequences. Perhaps the world he had returned to would be better, but what about the people who were meant to die in the Blight? Their lives, their stories, would be erased. The sacrifices they had made to survive would be in vain.

The weight of altering history hung heavy on Max's conscience. He couldn't help but question the ethics of his mission, wondering if he had played a part in erasing those who had fought so hard to survive. Could he justify his actions, knowing that he had tampered with the fabric of reality?

As Max prepared to return to his own time, he couldn't help but wonder if he had made the right choice. He had prevented the Blight, yes, but at what cost? The consequences of altering history were immeasurable, and Max knew that he would carry the weight of those consequences with him forever.

Stepping back into the time-travel machine, Max felt a mix of emotions. He was relieved that the mission had been successful, but he also felt a profound sense of loss. The lives erased by his actions would forever haunt him, a constant reminder of the potential consequences of altering history.

As the machine whirred back to life, Max closed his eyes and prepared to return to his own time. He knew that the world he returned to would be different from the one he had left behind. And as he emerged from the machine, the weight of history settled on his shoulders once more, reminding him of the delicate balance between altering the past and preserving the future.",1,0.0
"idea, she wouldn't even let him kiss her good-night. (For fear of losing her determination, Farrel liked to think.) He opened his eyes again to look past the Pornsens, out of the curving port of his office-lab in the Exodus VII's flank, at the scene outside the ship. At the edge of the clearing he could see Danny Stern and his crew, tiny beneath the cavernous sunbeam-shot overhang of giant leaves. Danny was standing up at the controls of the 'dozer, waving his arms. His crew was struggling to get a log set so he could shove it into place with the 'dozer. They were repairing a break in the barricade--the place where one of New Earth's giant saurians had come stamping and whistling through last night to kill three colonists before it could be blasted out of existence. It was difficult. Damned difficult. A brand-new world here, all ready to receive the refugees from dying Earth. Or rather, all ready to be _made_ ready, which was the task ahead of the Exodus VII's personnel. An Earth-like world. Green, warm, fertile--and crawling, leaping, hooting and snarling with ferocious beasts of every variety. Farrel could certainly see the women's point in banding together and refusing to produce children. Something inside a woman keeps her from wanting to bring life into peril--at least, when the peril seems temporary, and security is both remembered and anticipated. Pornsen said, ""I guess I feel just about like Mary does. I--I don't see any reason for having a kid until we get this place ironed out and safe to live in."" ""That's going to take time, Ralph."" Farrel clasped his hands in front of him and delivered the speech he had delivered so often in the past few weeks. ""Ten or twelve years before we really get set up here. We've got to build from the ground up, you know. We'll have to find and mine our metals. Build our machines to build shops to build more machines. There'll be resources that we _won't_ find, and we'll have to learn what this planet has to offer in their stead. Colonizing New Earth isn't simply a matter of landing and throwing together a shining city. I only wish it were. ""Six weeks ago we landed. We haven't yet dared to venture more than a mile from this spot. We've cut down trees and built the barricade and our houses. After protecting ourselves we have to eat. We've planted gardens. We've produced test-tube calves and piglets. The calves are doing fine, but the piglets are dying one by one. We've got to find out why. ""It's going to be a long, long time before we have even a minimum of security, much less luxury. Longer than you think.... So much longer that waiting until the security arrives before having children is out of the question. There are critters out there--"" he nodded toward the port and the busy clearing beyond--""that we haven't been able to kill. We've thrown everything we have at them, and they come back for more. We'll have to find out what _will_ kill them--how they differ from those we _are_ able to kill. We are six hundred people and a spaceship, Ralph. We have techniques. That's _all_. Everything else we've got to dig up out of this planet. We'll need people, Mary; we'll need the children. We're counting on them. They're vital to the plans we've made."" Mary Pornsen said, ""Damn the plans. I won't have one. Not now. You've just done a nice job of describing all my reasons. And all the other girls feel the same way."" * * * * * She looked out the window at the 'dozer and crew. Danny Stern was still waving his arms; the log was almost in place. ""George and May Wright were killed last night. So was Farelli. If George and May had had a child, the monster would have trampled it too--it went right through their cabin like cardboard. It isn't fair to bring a baby into--"" Farrel said, ""Fair, Mary? Maybe it isn't fair _not_ to have one. _Not_ to bring it into being and give it a chance. Life's always a gamble--"" ""_It_ doesn't exist,"" Mary said. She smiled. ""Don't try circumlocution on me, Doc. I'm not religious. I don't believe that spermatozoa and an ovum, if not allowed to cuddle up together, add up to murder."" ""That isn't what I meant--"" ""You were getting around to it--which means you've run out of good arguments."" ""No. I've a few left."" Farrel looked at the two stubborn faces: Mary's, pleasant and pretty, but set as steel; Ralph's, uncomfortable, thoughtful, but mirroring his definite willingness to follow his wife's lead. Farrel cleared his throat. ""You know how important it is that this colony be established? You know that, don't you? In twenty years or so the ships will start arriving. Hundreds of them. Because we sent a message back to Earth saying we'd found a habitable planet. Thousands of people from Earth, coming here to the new world we're supposed to get busy and carve out for them. We were selected for that task--first of judging the right planet, then of working it over. Engineers, chemists, agronomists, all of us--we're the task force. We've got to do the job. We've got to test, plant, breed, re-balance, create. There'll be a lot of trial and error. We've got to work out a way of life, so the thousands who will follow can be introduced safely and painlessly into the--well, into the organism. And we'll need new blood for the jobs ahead. We'll need young people--"" Mary said, ""A few years one way or the other won't matter much, Doc. Five or six years from now this place will be a lot safer. Then we women will start producing. But not now."" ""It won't work that way,"" Farrel said. ""We're none of us kids any longer. I'm fifty-five. Ralph, you're forty-three. I realize that I",0,0.0

"Fred Thomas Martin (June 13, 1927 – October 10, 2022) was an American artist, writer and arts administrator and educator who was active in the San Francisco Bay Area art scene since the late 1940s.[1] He was a driving force of the Bay Area art scene from the mid 1950s until his retirement from the San Francisco Art Institute. In addition to his artistic practice, Martin was widely known for his work as a longtime administrator and Professor Emeritus at the San Francisco Art Institute (SFAI).[2] Fred Martin was born on June 13, 1927, in San Francisco, California,[3] where his parents lived in an apartment on Geary Street. His father was an electrical engineer, his mother a homemaker. A year after his birth, the family moved to nearby Alameda, and later to Oakland, where he attended school. In his final year of high school, Martin decided to major in Decorative Art at University of California, Berkeley after a teacher determined his interests were more creative than scientific, although he originally hoped to pursue a degree in Physics. It was during this time that he was first exposed to ancient Chinese art and visual culture, which have deeply influenced his own art.[4] Martin received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of California, Berkeley in 1949, at a time when painters Sam Francis and Jay DeFeo were also students in the art department. There, he studied with painter and theorist Erle Loran and WPA era painter Ray Scepter Boynton. Between 1949 and 1950, Martin studied with David Park, in addition to Mark Rothko and Clyfford Still, who were visiting instructors, at the California School of Fine Arts (now the San Francisco Art Institute). He returned to UC Berkeley a few years later and obtained a Master of Arts degree in 1954.[5] Shortly after completing his graduate education, Martin was hired as the registrar of the Oakland Museum of Art, where he was also enlisted to help with various installation tasks. During his time there, he informally helped build its world-renowned collection of California art, and encouraged then director Paul Mills to identify and exhibit a school of local artists. Martin suggested his friends David Park, Elmer Bischoff and several other artists, who Mills eventually grouped together as leaders of the Bay Area Figurative Movement in a historic 1957 exhibition.[6] In 1958 Martin became the Director of Exhibitions at the San Francisco Art Institute, where he oversaw the Art Bank, an innovative, membership-based initiative that supported the work of several generations of artists in the Bay Area. Assembling the works of painters, sculptors, and printmakers, including Otis Oldfield, David Park, Richard Diebenkorn, Bruce Conner, Joan Brown, Jay DeFeo, and Wally Hedrick, Martin organized exhibitions of Bay Area artists at local and national galleries and museums between 1958 and 1965.[7] In addition to serving as Director of Exhibitions at the San Francisco Art Institute between 1958-1965, Martin was Director of the College between 1965-1975; Dean of Academic Affairs between 1983-1992; and Vice President and Dean of Academic Affairs Emeritus 1992-2016. Martin's decades-long tenure at SFAI has placed him at the center of the Bay Area Art scene as an influential artist and mentor.[8] When Martin began painting in the late 1940s, he used oil paint or house paint to create semi-abstracted scenes based on real and imagined imagery. At times these works ventured into action painting; other works, however, were created with a Chinese sumi brush, and focused more on calligraphic brushstrokes as figures and objects developed among various textures.[1] Writing on Martin's work in a 1973 SFMoMA catalog, curator Suzanne Foley notes that his artistic style developed as he was studying with David Park, who emphasized ""compositional simplicity"", while also receiving ""the greatest direction"" from the ""beat ambiance"" of the time, which spoke to ""Fred Martin's sensitivity"".[9] Martin's work reflects his broad and diverse range of interests, including Jungian psychology.[10] Over the years, much of his art has contained autobiographical details often in the form of symbols or anthropomorphic imagery. Poppies, for example, represent his first wife, Jean, who was also an artist, while grain, seeds, and phallic symbols allude to regeneration.[11] Martin died in Berkeley, California, on October 10, 2022, at the age of 95.[3] Throughout his career, Martin has often incorporated text in his paintings, drawings, collages, and lithographs.[1] At times, these experiments have led to limited edition artist's books such as: In addition to creating artist's books, Martin worked as a columnist for ARTWEEK magazine, where he was a consulting editor from 1976-92.[12] He began writing on art early on in his career. In the 1960s, for example, he contributed reviews, features, and essays for leading art periodicals like Artforum, Art International, and Art Journal. Throughout his career as an arts administrator and educator, Martin also supported other Bay Area artists by writing on their works for various publications, and continues to be cited by curators and researchers who are revisiting the region's twentieth-century artistic circles.[13] For instance, Martin wrote on Wally Hedrick's work for an exhibition catalog coinciding with his show at Pavilion Gallery (1967) and later contributed the main essay for the book published in conjunction with Jay DeFeo's 1969 exhibitions at the Pasadena Art Museum and San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.[14] In the late 1950s, Martin was loosely associated with a group of artists who were living and working in the North Beach neighborhood of San Francisco such as Jay DeFeo and Wally Hedrick, who were married, Joan Brown, Manuel Neri, Bernice Bing, and Deborah Remington. In 1954 Hedrick and Remington co-founded the Six Gallery, with four other artists and poets. A year later, Martin was invited to exhibit there. His first solo show of three at the independent art space included mixed-media abstract sculptures that poet and Six Gallery co-founder Michael McClure described as ""pieces of surrealist furniture,"" miniature oil paintings on masonite, and a few larger paintings.[15] While Martin's exhibition was on view, the gallery hosted an evening of Beat poets, including",0,0.0

"Ugh, I seriously cannot deal with my parents right now. They just don't get it. It's like they're from a different planet or something. I mean, how can they expect me to be okay with all these exams and never-ending pressure? It's suffocating, man. And it's not like I'm asking for much - just a little bit of love and understanding, you know?

Every day feels like a constant battle with them. It's like they're obsessed with my grades and success, as if that's the only thing that matters in life. It's infuriating. I just want to scream at them and tell them to back off. Can't they see that I'm more than just a test score?

And don't even get me started on their ridiculous expectations. It's like they expect me to be perfect, to have it all figured out at such a young age. Well, news flash, Mom and Dad, life doesn't work that way. I'm still trying to figure out who I am and what I want, and your constant nagging isn't helping.

All I want is for them to support me, to be there for me when I'm feeling overwhelmed or stressed. But no, instead, they pile on even more pressure. It's like they don't understand that I'm human too, that I have limits. I can't be expected to handle everything without breaking down.

It feels like I'm trapped in this never-ending cycle of exams and expectations. I just want to escape, to run away from it all. Sometimes, I fantasize about packing my bags and disappearing, leaving behind all the stress and drama. Maybe then they'll finally realize how much they've been pushing me and how much I need their love and support.

But deep down, underneath all the anger and frustration, there's this longing for their understanding. I yearn for their love, for them to see me as more than just a grade-making machine. I want them to understand that success isn't solely defined by numbers on a report card.

I wish they could see that I'm trying my best. I study for hours, sacrifice my social life, and pour my heart and soul into every assignment. But it's like they only see the mistakes and the shortcomings. It's never enough for them.

I just want to be heard, to have my feelings acknowledged and validated. Is that too much to ask? I don't need them to solve all my problems or make everything magically better. I just want them to listen, to let me vent without judgment or criticism.

But for now, I'll keep my frustrations bottled up inside. I'll continue to grit my teeth and pretend everything's okay. Because that's what they expect, right? The perfect, obedient child who never complains. But one day, things will change. One day, I'll find my voice and let it all out. And maybe, just maybe, they'll finally listen and see me for who I really am.",1,1.0
"I went a long, long time before ever seeing a baby born in the caul (inside the amniotic sac). In hospitals, the membranes are ruptured (broken) somewhere along the way in every birth I have been to. Even in birth centers, Artificial Rupture of Membranes (AROM) is absolutely commonplace. At Casa, the students need to learn to rupture the membranes (and yes, ""rupture"" isn't the prettiest word... some say ""release"" which IS nicer, but absolutely contraindicated in AROM), so we routinely did so... sometimes with our fingers, fingernails (inside gloves), or with the AmniHook... a long crochet-needle looking thing with a beak on the end that snags the bag and breaks it, releasing the water. (Rupturing membranes is a blogspot unto itself... another day... remind me!) Then, a midwife at Casa thought it would be a grand idea to see how many babies we could have born in the caul and the game was on. I'd heard about an OB that was so disgusted with AROM that he offered a $50 bounty for every caul birth and shelled out thousands before calling the game... proving that it is possible and isn't dangerous and not AROMing did not slow labors down, but, in fact, helped women cope better. The first caul birth I saw was so cool! I was doula-ing at UCSD at the Birth Center (on the 4th floor) and the CNM was terrific in wanting to leave things alone. As the baby was being born, it dawned on me that the mom's membranes were still intact; soooo cool! The baby was born with a tight sac on the face and shoulders before the midwife used forceps to break and lift the bag off the baby's face before the first breath. Another I saw was at Casa. I spent a lot of time there in 2002... about 9 months total that year. There were times I was so exhausted, I could not get up to witness births. My first trip there in 1993, I went to every single birth I possibly could... 90 in 3 months, catching 30 myself. These long months of ""getting numbers"" in order to sit for the California exam, were exhausting and sometimes I just ignored the ""Birth in the Bear Room!"" call over the intercom. But, when cool things happened, I was asked to come anyway to photograph. I always made sure the mom was asked if it was okay before I was awakened because I had shown up once with a camera and a mom was horrified. I left with camera in tow. So, there was a birth happening and the membranes were still intact and someone knew the birth would be something to see. Groggily, I grabbed my camera and went to the birth, watching and taking picture after picture of the most amazing sight; the sac began protruding, water filling up the sac gradually... a slow, s l o w birth where the sac came long before a head did. I began seeing hair floating in the water behind the amazing amnion and chorion... flecks of vernix swirling around as the head began being able to be seen. I have a picture here: urlLink http://www.picturetrail.com/gallery/view?p=999&gid=4228092=631889members=1=emTzTTD1RyAd2 As the baby was born, the bag broke and water spilled onto the bed and the midwife lifted the bag over his face. I loved capturing it on film! One birth here in San Diego, I was the first assist and was behind a kneeling mama with the midwife. It was cave-dark and we began watching the membranes bulge the perineum. This midwife had not seen a birth in the caul, so I gave whispering instructions about how to manage it so the baby can breathe. When the head is born, it is important to watch for breathing motions because if those happen, it is important to remove the sac from the face. If s/he isn't making a motion to breathe, allowing the body to flow out inside the caul is perfectly fine. Once the chest is born, removing the sac is imperative since the first inhalation often comes from the release of chest compression from the vagina. I explained about lifting from the chin upwards because two midwives I know had babies aspirate their amniotic sac because it was pulled downwards from forehead to chin and as it came down, the baby inhaled. (Remember how I said we are a product of our experiences? This is a lesson I learned without it happening to me directly!) So, as she is pushing, we see a darkness in the forward moving sac... vernix? meconium? I had the third assist grab the flashlight and we peered into the sac. Inbetween pushes, the floating stuff settled to the bottom of the ""bag"" and we had to wait for the next contraction to stir things up again. It was wild to watch! Once the contraction began, we saw that it was, indeed, meconium and pretty darn thick, too. The midwife asked mom's permission to break the water right before the head was born so she could suction with a DeLee (something we don't do anymore) and mama said, ""okay,"" so we did. I often wonder what that would have looked like to let the baby keep coming in the floating mec pool. Probably safer. As this baby came out, even though the midwife had broken the bag, the amniotic sac was still covering the baby's face. She, however, did not see it! I showed her how it looked like cellophane and that anytime there are late ROM, to check closely to get the face cleared. She was wide-eyed as I pulled a completely covering film of amniotic sac off the baby's face... chin to forehead. The baby inhaled as I lifted. It is said that babies born in the caul are special or gifted. Various traditions around the world say that the baby will never drown... that the baby will be a midwife... that the baby will have a second sight",0,0.0
"The Miss USA 2015 pageant was marred by controversy and triggered a chain of events that had a significant impact on the event and those associated with it. The controversy began when Donald Trump, then the owner of the Miss Universe Organization, made derogatory remarks about Mexican immigrants during his presidential campaign announcement in June 2015. These comments caused an uproar among various groups and led to a widespread backlash against Trump and the Miss USA pageant.

As a result of Trump's remarks, a number of individuals and organizations distanced themselves from the Miss USA pageant. Firstly, the hosts, judges, and musical performers for the event started to withdraw their participation. Cheryl Burke, a professional dancer and former host of Dancing with the Stars, was among the first to withdraw. She expressed her disapproval of Trump's comments and stated that she couldn't associate herself with the pageant. Additionally, several musicians, including Flo Rida and Natalie La Rose, canceled their performances scheduled for the event.

The controversy also had a direct impact on the broadcasting of the pageant. Initially, the pageant was set to be aired on the NBC network, which had a long-standing relationship with the Miss Universe Organization. However, due to Trump's comments, NBC decided to sever ties with him and the organization. Consequently, the network announced that it would not be broadcasting the Miss USA pageant. This decision was a significant blow to the event's reach and viewership.

Moreover, several pageant officials and celebrities announced their intentions to boycott the event. Prominent figures such as Univision, the largest Spanish-language television network in the United States, severed ties with the Miss Universe Organization and declined to air the pageant. The decision led to a further reduction in the pageant's exposure and created an atmosphere of uncertainty around its future.

In response to the controversy and the subsequent backlash, the Miss Universe Organization and Donald Trump decided to part ways. Trump sold his stake in the organization to WME/IMG, a global talent agency, effectively severing all ties between him and the Miss USA pageant. This move aimed to distance the pageant from the controversy and salvage its reputation. The new owners, WME/IMG, took over the management of the event and worked towards repairing the damage caused by the controversy.

Despite the setbacks and uncertainties, the Miss USA 2015 pageant did eventually take place. It was held in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on July 12, 2015. Olivia Jordan from Oklahoma ultimately won the pageant and represented the United States in the Miss Universe competition. This result marked a small victory for the pageant, showing that it was possible to move forward despite the controversy and maintain its core purpose of promoting women and their accomplishments.

The controversy surrounding the Miss USA 2015 pageant had a lasting impact on the event and its reputation. It highlighted the importance of responsible and respectful conduct from those involved in the pageant's organization. The withdrawal of prominent hosts, judges, and performers, as well as the termination of broadcasting relationships, demonstrated the magnitude of the fallout from Trump's comments. However, the events that unfolded also led to important changes in the ownership and management of the pageant, paving the way for a fresh start and a renewed focus on the empowerment of women.",1,0.0
"Vellum is prepared animal skin or membrane, typically used as writing material. It is distinguished from parchment when it is made from calfskin, rather than that made from other animals,[1] or having a higher quality when it is not.[2] Vellum is prepared for writing and printing on and used for single pages, scrolls, codices, or books. Modern scholars and experts use the general and potentially-confusing term ""membrane"" more often.[2][3]: 9–10 It may be very hard to determine the animal species involved (let alone its age) without going to a laboratory depending on the way of making the paper.[4] Thus the term avoids the distinction between vellum and parchment.[2][3]: 9–10 Vellum is generally smooth and durable, but there are great variations in its texture which are affected by the way it is made and the quality of the skin. The making involves the cleaning, bleaching, stretching on a frame (a ""herse""), and scraping of the skin with a crescent-shaped knife (a ""lunarium"" or ""lunellum""). To create tension, the process goes back and forth between scraping, wetting and drying. Scratching the surface with pumice, and treating with lime or chalk to make it suitable for writing or printing ink can create a final look.[1] Modern ""paper vellum"" is made of synthetic plant material, and gets its name from its similar usage and high quality. It is used for a variety of purposes including tracing, technical drawings, plans and blueprints.[5][full citation needed][6][7] The word ""vellum"" is borrowed from Old French vélin 'calfskin', derived in turn from the Latin word vitulinum 'made from calf'.[8] However, in Europe, from Roman times, the word was used for the best quality of prepared skin, regardless of the animal from which the hide was obtained. Calf, sheep, and goat were all commonly used, and other animals, including pig, deer, donkey, horse, or camel were used on occasion. The best quality, ""uterine vellum"",[9] was said to be made from the skins of stillborn or unborn animals, although the term was also applied to fine quality skins made from young animals.[2] However, there has long been much blurring of the boundaries between these terms. In 1519, William Horman could write in his Vulgaria: ""That stouffe that we wrytte upon, and is made of beestis skynnes, is somtyme called parchement, somtyme velem, somtyme abortyve, somtyme membraan.""[10] Writing in 1936, Lee Ustick explained that: To-day the distinction, among collectors of manuscripts, is that vellum is a highly refined form of skin, parchment a cruder form, usually thick, harsh, less highly polished than vellum, but with no distinction between skin of calf, or sheep, or of goat.[11] French sources, closer to the original etymology, tend to define velin as from calf only, while the British Standards Institution defines parchment as made from the split skin of several species, and vellum from the unsplit skin.[12] In the usage of modern practitioners of the artistic crafts of writing, illuminating, lettering, and bookbinding, ""vellum"" is normally reserved for calfskin, while any other skin is called ""parchment"".[13] Vellum allows some light to pass through it. It is made from the skin of a young animal. The skin is washed with water and lime (Calcium hydroxide), then soaked in lime for several days to soften and remove the hair.[14] Once clear, the two sides of the skin are distinct: the body side and the hairy side. The ""inside body side"" of the skin is usually the lighter and more refined of the two. The hair follicles may be visible on the outer side, together with any scars from when the animal was alive. The membrane can also show the pattern of the animal's vein network called the ""veining"" of the sheet.[15] The makers remove any remaining hair (""scudding"") and dry the skin by attaching it to a frame (a ""herse"").[3]: 11 They attach the skin at points around the edge with cords and wrap the part next to these points around a pebble (a ""pippin"").[3]: 11 They then use a crescent shaped knife, (a ""lunarium"" or ""lunellum""), to clean off any remaining hairs. The makers thoroughly clean the skin and process it into sheets once it is completely dry. They can extract many sheets from the piece of skin. The number of sheets depends on the size of the skin and the required length and breath of each individual sheet. For example, the average calfskin could provide roughly three and a half medium sheets of writing material. The makers can double it when they fold the skin into two conjoined leaves, also known as a bifolium. Historians have found evidence of manuscripts where the scribe wrote down the medieval instructions now followed by modern membrane makers.[16] The makers rubbed them with a round, flat object (""pouncing"") to ensure that the ink would adhere to the surface.[15] Even so, ink would gradually flake off of the membrane, especially if it was used in a scroll that was frequently rolled and unrolled. Once the vellum is prepared, traditionally a quire is formed of a group of several sheets. Raymond Clemens and Timothy Graham point out, in their Introduction to Manuscript Studies, that ""the quire was the scribe's basic writing unit throughout the Middle Ages"".[3]: 14 Guidelines are then made on the membrane. They note ""'pricking' is the process of making holes in a sheet of parchment (or membrane) in preparation of its ruling. The lines were then made by ruling between the prick marks ...The process of entering ruled lines on the page to serve as a guide for entering text. Most manuscripts were ruled with horizontal lines that served as the baselines on which the text was entered and with vertical bounding lines that marked the boundaries of the columns"".[3]: 15–17 Most of the finer sort of medieval manuscripts, whether illuminated or not, were written on vellum. Some Gandharan Buddhist texts were written on vellum, and all Sifrei Torah (Hebrew: ספר תורה Sefer Torah; plural: ספרי תורה, Sifrei Torah) are written on kosher klaf or vellum. A quarter of",0,0.0
"Simon Garber (born 1966) is president and CEO of several taxi cab companies including Yellow Cab SLS Jet Management Corp in New York City and Chicago Carriage Cab Company in Chicago. Garber's companies are estimated to have the highest number of medallions in both Long Island City and Chicago, earning Garber the nickname of ""Taxi King"". Garber's cab companies have been involved in several scandals including the illegal use of salvaged police cars in the Chicago fleet and overcharging cab drivers in New York for leasing a medallion. In 2009, Garber founded the International Polo Club of Colts Neck near his residence in Colts Neck, New Jersey. Simon Garber was born in 1966 in Odesa, Ukraine. In 1978, Garber immigrated with his parents to New Jersey where his father was a sheet-metal worker and his mother was a nurse. Garber reports that he initially had difficulty with bullying in school, until he joined a group of Lubavitchers who paid for him to attend a Jewish day school and helped him get a summer job at a Jewish camp.[7] Garber started driving taxi cabs in New York City at the age of 18 to help pay for college, eventually owning two cabs. Soon he was buying and selling New York medallions (city-regulated individual permits to operate a cab) for a profit.[8] Garber has claimed to be the holder of the most New York medallions, with over 400 to his name, though the state's Attorney General office has stated that he only controls 275.[9][10] In 1992, Garber became friends with Russian politician Vladimir Slutsker while on vacation in Monaco. Through Slutsker, Garber was introduced to several Russian high-ranking officials. Three years later, Slutsker convinced Garber to start the company Moscow Taxi with Garber's brother-in-law Eduard Sheinen. Using his political ties, Garber's business eventually grew to over 2,500 vehicles before a weak Russian economy forced the company to downsize the fleet.[8] While in Russia in 2001, Garber became friends with Patrick Daley, the son of long-time Chicago mayor Richard M. Daley. City officials tightly regulate all aspects of medallions ownership, granting permission to purchase medallions on an individual basis. Within a year of meeting Patrick, Garber quickly acquired over 300 Chicago taxi medallions. Garber also hired Mayor Daley's former chief of staff Gery Chico as a City Hall lobbyist. In 2003, Garber used this political capital to start the Chicago Carriage Cab Company and was granted permission to operate the taxi business in Chicago. Within six years, the Chicago Carriage Cab Company had amassed over 800 medallions, making it the largest taxi company in the city.[9] Michael Cohen and Garber were associates together with large interests in taxi companies in the United States.[11][12] Garber enjoys playing polo and has a training area on his 10-acre estate in Colts Neck, New Jersey.[2][6] In 2009, Garber founded the International Polo Club of Colts Neck, which is located in New Jersey.[5] Garber's polo teams are sponsored by his taxi companies, and compete in events worldwide.[3] In 2010 city officials in Chicago investigated claims that some of the taxis in the city had been previously categorized as salvage vehicles (typically an insurance designation meaning the vehicles were damaged enough that it would cost more to fix the vehicle than the intrinsic worth of vehicle). Chicago law prohibits operating any vehicle as a taxi that was once deemed a salvage title. Chicago investigators found over 340 vehicles, of which 183 vehicles belonged to Garber's Chicago Carriage Cab Company. Garber had bought salvaged police cars, cleaned the titles of the salvage designation, and then illegally added the vehicles to his fleet. City officials fined Garber and his business associates up to $50,000 per vehicle for a total of $9 million. Garber's 183 salvage vehicles represented approximately 20% of his entire fleet. The prosecutors also estimated that many of the cars had been in service for up to 4 years prior to the investigation. Additionally, the Chicago Sun-Times newspaper investigated 100 of Garber's taxis from other fleets not associated with Chicago and found that 23 had previously been designated as salvage titles. The newspaper stated that it was unknown whether those vehicles were still in circulation.[3] More details of the salvage scheme (and further implication of Garber's involvement) became available through the 2014 trial of one of Garber's business partners, Alexsandr Igolnikov, who was convicted of conspiracy as well as interstate transportation and possession of false automobile titles. Igolnikov was responsible for purchasing the salvage vehicles, repairing them, and then working through corrupt auto brokers to obtain clean titles from Indiana or Illinois. Once the new titles were secured, the salvaged vehicles were painted maroon and entered into Garber's taxi fleet as well as other fleets co-owned by Garber and Igolnikov. Igolnikov would repair and paint the vehicles in a garage owned by Garber.[13] On August 12, 2014, the Attorney General along with the Taxi and Limousine Commission for the state of New York announced that Garber's Yellow Cab SLS Jet Management Corp. had agreed to pay approximately $1.6 million in restitution and fines for overcharging cab drivers that leased vehicles from Garber. The taxi drivers who leased through Garber were required to pre-pay to lease the taxi, but did not provide a way for this to be done. If the taxi driver did not pre-pay, the driver was assessed a ""late fee"" at the time of payment, effectively ensuring that a late fee was included on every lease agreement. A few drivers reported that when they contacted the company for an explanation of the late fees, they were told that the fee was for leasing a hybrid fuel car, which is illegal in the state of New York. The Attorney General estimated that Garber's practice had overcharged approximately 2,000 taxi drivers. As part of the settlement, Garber agreed to pay approximately $1.4 million in restitution to the taxi drivers and $200,000 in fines and fees.[10][14] In 2012 the Chicago Tribune found that Garber's Chicago Carriage Cab Company had repeatedly",0,0.0
"Abertillery (/ˌæbərtɪˈlɛəri/; Welsh: Abertyleri) is a town and a community of the Ebbw Fach valley in the historic county of Monmouthshire, Wales. Following local government reorganisation it became part of the Blaenau Gwent County Borough administrative area. The surrounding landscape borders the Brecon Beacons National Park and the Blaenavon World heritage Site.[2] Formerly a major coal mining centre the Abertillery area was transformed in the 1990s using EU and other funding to return to a greener environment. Situated on the A467 the town is 15 miles (24 km) north of the M4 and 5 miles (8 km) south of the A465 ""Heads of the Valleys"" trunk road. It is about 25 miles (40 km) by road from Cardiff and 47 miles (76 km) from Bristol. According to the 2011 Census, 4.8% of the ward's 4,416 (212 residents) resident-population can speak, read, and write Welsh.[3] This is below the county's figure of 5.5% of 67,348 (3,705 residents) who can speak, read, and write Welsh.[3] The name of the community means ""the mouth of the River Tyleri"", which flows into the town. The nameTyleri is probably derived from a personal name.[4] Abertillery's traditional-style town centre mainly developed in the late 19th century and as such has some interesting Victorian architecture. Spread over 4 main streets the town in its heyday had two department stores and a covered Victorian arcade linking two of the main shopping areas. These were all included in a Blaenau Gwent Borough Council remodelling and modernisation project using European Union funding in a £13 million programme spread over a 5-year period ending in 2015.[5] The project included a new multi-storey car park, a revamp of public areas and the town's Metropole Theatre.[6] This building provides production, exhibition, conference and meeting facilities as well as housing Abertillery museum. In March 2014 Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex, officiated at the launch of Jubilee Square, a public facility in the town centre next to St Michael's Church.[7] Major industry came to the area in 1843 when the locality's first deep coal mine was sunk at Tir Nicholas Farm, Cwmtillery. The town developed rapidly thereafter and played a major part in the South Wales coalfield. Its population rose steeply, being 10,846 in the 1891 census and 21,945 ten years later. The population peaked just short of 40,000[8] around the beginning of the 1930s. Eventually there were six deep coal mines, numerous small coal levels, a tin works, brick works, iron foundry and light engineering businesses in the area. Just one of the coal mines, Cwmtillery, produced over 32 million tons of coal in its lifetime and at its height employed 2760 men and boys.[9] In 1960 an underground explosion at Six Bells Colliery resulted in the loss of life of 45 local miners. Fifty years later the archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams officiated at the launch of the Guardian mining memorial. This artistically acclaimed monument standing at 20m tall overlooks Parc Arael Griffin, the now reclaimed and landscaped former colliery site. The adjoining Ty Ebbw Fach visitor centre provides conference facilities, a restaurant and a ""mining valley"" experience room. Not long after the disaster the renowned artist L. S. Lowry visited the area and recorded the scene. The resultant landscape painting now hangs in National Museum Cardiff.[10] The coal mines remained the predominant economic emphasis until the general run down of the industry in the 1980s. Away from the town centre, the often steep sided nature of the landscape, imposes its own demands on development. Whilst this sounds limiting it has helped provide the almost amphitheatre nature of Abertillery Park, often described as one of the most attractive rugby grounds in world rugby.[11] The street plan and housing stock flow uninterrupted from Cwmtillery in the north to Six Bells in the south, forming the town that is Abertillery. Prior to 1974 local government was provided by Abertillery Urban District Council (AUDC).[12] Its area included the small neighbouring villages of Aberbeeg, Llanhilleth and Brynithel. Historical data relating to Abertillery occasionally refers to this AUDC area meaning that it can be difficult to compare like with like. For example, the 2014 population for the wider conurbation area is around 20,000 rather than the 11,000 often quoted for Abertillery itself. Whilst in the main the area has an older housing stock there are several developments of modern, often large homes, generally found on the outskirts of the town with views out over the surrounding area. These apart, terraced council tax band A and B properties predominate, meaning that average house prices are among the most affordable in the UK. There are very few written historical records relating to the area before the town developed in the middle of the 19th century. Nevertheless, there are facts that you can use to outline important events. Before the coming of major industry, Abertillery was little more than an area of scattered farms in the ancient parish of Aberystruth. In 1779 the parish minister Edmund Jones[16] described the area thus: ""The valley of Tyleri ... is the most delightful. The trees ... especially the beech trees, abounding about rivers great and small, the hedges and lanes make these places exceeding pleasant and the passing by them delightful and affecting ... in these warm valleys, with the prospect of the grand high mountains about them would make very delightful habitations."" In 1799 clergyman and historian Archdeacon William Coxe toured the area and in writing a diary of his travels described it as ""... richly wooded, and highly cultivated...we looked down with delight upon numerous valleys ... with romantic scenery"". The entire population of Aberystruth parish at the turn of the 19th century was just a little over 800. It is not known what the population of Abertillery was at the time but it was probably in the very low hundreds, all of whom would have spoken Welsh only. The area's first deep coal mine was sunk in 1843. The first reading rooms were set up in Abertillery in 1856. However, when",0,0.0
"Miss USA 2015 was the 64th Miss USA pageant, held at the Raising Cane's River Center Arena in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on July 12, 2015. All fifty states and the District of Columbia competed. Nia Sanchez of Nevada crowned her successor Olivia Jordan of Oklahoma at the end of the event. This was Oklahoma's first Miss USA title in the pageant's history.[2] The pageant was broadcast on Reelz after remarks made by Miss Universe Organization owner Donald Trump regarding Mexican immigrants during Trump's speech announcing his candidacy for the Republican nomination for U.S. President on June 16, 2015, in New York City led NBC, which had broadcast the pageant since 2003, and incumbent rights holders Univision Communications and Televisa to terminate their relationships with the Organization and Trump himself.[3] It was also affected by many of the originally announced hosts, judges and musical performers pulling out in protest.[4][5][6] Miss USA generated a unique Twitter audience of 2.42 million, according to Nielsen Social, No. 1 among entertainment series and specials during the week ended July 12. Entertainment correspondent Alex Wehrley, a former Miss Wisconsin USA 2009, was brought in to host the pageant alongside game show host Todd Newton after original hosts Cheryl Burke of Dancing with the Stars and MSNBC anchor Thomas Roberts withdrew.[7] This was the only Miss USA to be aired on Reelz and this was the last edition that Donald Trump had been the owner. This was also the first pageant since 1964 to take place in the month of July. Delegates from 50 states and the District of Columbia were chosen in state pageants held from July 2014 to January 2015. The first state pageant was Florida, held on July 12, 2014, and the final pageants were New Hampshire and New York, both held on January 18, 2015; nine of these delegates were former Miss Teen USA state winners, two of them were former Miss America state winners and one is former Miss World America who competed at Miss World 2013. § Voted into Top 11 after the swimsuit competition by the public . Prior to the final telecast, the delegates compete in the preliminary competition, which involves private interviews with the judges and a presentation show where they compete in swimsuit and evening gown. It was held on July 10, 2015, on the official Miss USA YouTube channel and was hosted by Nick Teplitz and Nia Sanchez.[8] The format reverted to top 15, as it was in 2013, during the final competition, the top fifteen semifinalists competed in swimsuit, 10 of the 15 semifinalists were chosen by the judges, while one was chosen for a public vote, as they competed in evening gown, before five were chosen to advance. The top 5 competed in the final question round signed up by a panel of judges and a final runway, the winner was decided by a panel of judges alongside the four runners-up. 51 delegates have been confirmed:[9] On June 25, 2015, Univision Communications president and CEO Randy Falco announced that the company would terminate its contract to broadcast Spanish language coverage of the 2015 Miss USA pageant (which was set to air on UniMás) and sever its business ties with Miss Universe Organization co-owner Donald Trump, following comments regarding illegal Mexican immigrants that were made by Trump during his speech announcing his candidacy for the Republican Party nomination for President of the United States on June 16, in which Trump stated that illegal Mexicans immigrating into the U.S. were responsible for importing drugs, and bringing crime, rapists, and drug dealers into the country, and called for the building of a wall along the Mexico–United States border.[4][39][40] Chilean actor Cristián de la Fuente and Puerto Rican actress Roselyn Sánchez, who were both slated to host the Spanish language broadcast of the pageant, also announced that they were pulling out of the telecast, citing their offense to Trump's comments. Colombian reggaeton singer J Balvin, who was scheduled to make his first musical performance on mainstream U.S. television, also announced that he would also no longer participate in the event.[4][39][41][42][43] Miss Universe 2006 Zuleyka Rivera of Puerto Rico, who was set to judge the pageant, announced she would no longer participate as well.[44] In a statement by Univision regarding its decision, Falco cited the consideration of the views of its predominately Hispanic broadcast audience and corporate employee base, that ""[Univision] see[s] first-hand the work ethic, love for family, strong religious values and the important role Mexican immigrants and Mexican-Americans have had and will continue to have in building the future of our country."" Following the announcement of the company's decision, a lawyer for Trump stated that he is strongly considering taking legal action against Univision Communications for its refusal to carry the Miss USA telecast, alleging it violated the terms of the five-year broadcast and co-production agreement for the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants that Univision signed with the Miss Universe Organization five months earlier on February 5.[45] Trump himself accused the Government of Mexico, among other parties, of ""putting tremendous pressure on Univision to break their signed and fully effective contract with the Miss Universe Organization"" because of his statements ""exposing to the public, and the world, the terrible and costly trade deals that the United States is incompetently making with Mexico"".[39][46] Univision noted that despite the decision by its entertainment division to terminate its business relationship with the Miss Universe Organization, its news division and owned-and-operated broadcast outlets would continue to provide coverage of Trump and all other presidential candidates during the 2016 presidential campaign ""to ensure our audience continues to have access to all points of view"".[47] On June 26, Trump notified Falco that Univision employees would no longer be allowed to enter or hold membership with the Trump National Doral Miami golf course, which abuts Univision's corporate headquarters in Doral, Florida. That same day on his Instagram account, Trump also released personal correspondence from Univision anchor Jorge Ramos – containing Ramos' personal work",0,0.0
"Barbapedana, a Milanese minstrel and cantastorie (story singer) from the late 19th century, holds a special place in the cultural history of Milan. The word ""barbapedana"" itself is derived from ""barba"" (beard) and ""pedana"" (platform), representing the iconic image of a bearded minstrel standing on a raised wooden platform, captivating audiences with his songs and stories.

The tradition of the Barbapedana can be traced back to the medieval period, when traveling storytellers would entertain crowds in the streets and squares of Milan. These performers, often with long beards, would sing and recite rhymes, accompanied by simple musical instruments like the tambourine or accordion. They were known for their ability to captivate their listeners with tales of love, adventure, and local folklore.

The popularity of the Barbapedana reached its peak in the late 19th century, with one name standing out among the rest - Enrico Molaschi. Born in 1843 in the small town of Desio, Molaschi dedicated his life to preserving and popularizing the tradition of the Barbapedana. He traveled extensively, performing in squares, taverns, and theaters across Milan and the Lombardy region.

Molaschi's interpretations of Barbapedana songs and rhymes were characterized by his deep understanding of the Milanese dialect and his ability to bring characters to life through his storytelling. His performances were highly theatrical, as he would assume different voices and personas, making his performances even more engaging and memorable. Molaschi's talent and charisma earned him a significant following, and he became a beloved figure in Milanese society.

The songs and rhymes performed by Barbapedana artists like Molaschi often had a satirical and comedic tone, poking fun at social and political figures of the time. They were also deeply rooted in local traditions and customs, serving as a form of cultural preservation. The Barbapedana was not only entertainment, but also a means of conveying stories, values, and historical events to the masses.

Sadly, after Molaschi's death in 1907, the tradition of the Barbapedana gradually declined. Modernization and changing tastes in entertainment contributed to its demise. The songs and stories of the Barbapedana were gradually replaced by other forms of popular entertainment, such as cinema and radio.

Nevertheless, the legacy of Enrico Molaschi and the Barbapedana tradition lives on, albeit in a more limited form. Efforts have been made to revive and promote this cultural heritage, with occasional performances and exhibitions dedicated to the Barbapedana. These events serve as a reminder of a bygone era and the importance of preserving our cultural roots.

In conclusion, Barbapedana, the Milanese minstrel and cantastorie, played a significant role in the cultural landscape of late 19th century Milan. Enrico Molaschi, the most well-known interpreter of Barbapedana songs, captured the hearts of audiences with his captivating performances. Although the tradition has declined over time, the legacy of the Barbapedana lives on, reminding us of the power of storytelling and the importance of preserving our cultural heritage.",1,0.0
"As I look back on my childhood growing up in the deep south, one thing that stands out vividly in my memory is the strict rules and consequences surrounding the use of foul language. In my household, like many others in the community, swearing or using inappropriate words was simply not tolerated. It was seen as a sign of disrespect, and my parents made sure we understood that from a very young age.

I remember the first time I unwittingly let a curse word slip out of my mouth. I must have been around six years old, and I was playing outside with my older siblings. There was a moment of frustration when my brother accidentally bumped into me, and without thinking, I blurted out a string of words that I had heard from some older kids in the neighborhood. Immediately, my sister's eyes widened in shock, and she grabbed my arm, pulling me aside.

With a stern expression, she explained to me the gravity of what I had just said. She emphasized that it was inappropriate and unacceptable, and told me our parents would be furious if they found out. She made me promise never to use those words again and reminded me of the punishment we would face if we did.

The rules surrounding foul language in my household were clear and non-negotiable. My parents believed that such language was not only disrespectful but also reflected poorly on our upbringing and character. Words had power, and using inappropriate language was seen as a sign of moral decay.

If caught using foul language, the consequences were severe. The first punishment was the dreaded ""mouth washing."" This involved my parent taking a bar of soap, wetting it with water, and then ordering the offender to open their mouth. They would then rub the soap against our tongues, leaving a bitter and unpleasant taste that lingered for hours. It was an effective deterrent, as the association between the taste of soap and improper language was enough to dissuade us from using it again.

In addition to the mouth washing, we would also be given extra chores or have privileges taken away as further punishment. For example, if caught using foul language, we might be assigned to clean the entire house or be grounded from going outside to play with friends for a certain period of time. The punishments not only served as deterrents but also as a way to teach us responsibility and the consequences of our actions.

As I grew older, I began to understand the rationale behind my parents' strict rules. They believed that by enforcing such discipline, they were instilling in us a sense of respect for ourselves and others. They wanted us to understand that our words had power and could either build others up or tear them down.

However, as with any strict rule, there was an element of rebellion that came with it. As teenagers, my siblings and I couldn't help but test the boundaries and experiment with using inappropriate language outside the watchful eyes of our parents. We would sometimes gather with friends and engage in whispered conversations filled with forbidden words, relishing the thrill of breaking the rules.

Looking back, I realize that this rebellious phase was a natural part of growing up. It was our way of asserting our independence and pushing back against the strict regulations imposed upon us. We were exploring boundaries and discovering our own identities, which sometimes included pushing the limits of language.

But as we matured into young adulthood, we began to recognize the wisdom behind our parents' rules. We realized that foul language was not a necessary part of our vocabulary and that we could express ourselves effectively without resorting to inappropriate words. We started to appreciate the importance of showing respect and consideration for others, both in our speech and actions.

Growing up in the deep south and living under strict rules regarding foul language was undoubtedly challenging at times. The consequences for using inappropriate words were harsh, but they served their purpose in teaching us the value of respect and self-control. Ultimately, these lessons have stayed with me throughout my life, and I am grateful for the strong moral foundation that my parents instilled in me.",1,-1.0
"Deep within the heart of a remote wilderness, nestled amongst towering trees and rugged mountains, stood a small, rustic cabin. The only sounds that penetrated the silence were the gentle rustling of leaves and the distant call of birds. It was here, in this isolated haven, that a mysterious death had occurred.

News of the incident had spread like wildfire through the close-knit community of farmers and woodmen who inhabited the surrounding area. Rumors swirled, tales of foul play and supernatural occurrences added to the intrigue. The young man who had traveled from the city to attend the inquest was both a spectator and a protagonist in this enigmatic tale.

As the sun began its descent, casting long shadows across the cabin, the coroner arrived. He was a stern and authoritative figure, his demeanor commanding respect. With a keen eye for detail, he meticulously examined the surroundings, searching for any clues that might shed light on the mysterious death.

Meanwhile, the young man anxiously awaited his turn to testify. He had traveled to the remote cabin armed with his own version of events, a fictional account that he had hastily penned and sent to his newspaper before embarking on this journey. It was a story that blurred the line between imagination and reality, leaving the reader questioning the truth.

The coroner, however, was not one to be swayed by tales spun from the depths of one's imagination. He questioned the young man's credibility, adamant that only the purest version of events would be acceptable as testimony. The young man, slightly perturbed by the coroner's skepticism, agreed to recount the events under oath.

As the young man began his testimony, the perspective shifted to his own recollection of the events. He described his arrival at the cabin, haunted by the eerie silence that enveloped the once lively abode. The air hung heavy with foreboding as he stepped inside, his footsteps echoing through the empty rooms.

In his narrative, the young man introduced a cast of characters, each with their own hidden motives and secrets. There was the enigmatic caretaker, a man shrouded in mystery with a deep knowledge of the surrounding wilderness. His weathered face bore the marks of a life lived close to nature, and his eyes held a hint of ancient wisdom.

Then there was the reclusive artist, known for his macabre depictions of the surrounding landscape. His paintings seemed to possess a dark energy, as if they held the secrets of the forest within their brushstrokes. The young man, drawn to this peculiar artist, sought his guidance in unraveling the mysteries that haunted the cabin.

As the young man continued his tale, the coroner listened intently, his skepticism slowly giving way to a begrudging admiration for the young man's storytelling abilities. The details were vivid, the characters richly developed, and yet, the line between fact and fiction remained blurred.

In the climax of the young man's narrative, he described a stormy night, where darkness fell like a shroud over the cabin. The wind howled, bending the trees to its will, and lightning illuminated the sky with an otherworldly glow. It was on this fateful night that the mysterious death occurred.

As the young man's testimony came to an end, the coroner sat in contemplative silence. The truth, it seemed, was as elusive as the secrets hidden within the depths of the wilderness. The characters in the young man's narrative were mere figments of his imagination, a reflection of his own perception and desires.

The coroner, finally breaking the silence, acknowledged the young man's storytelling prowess but stressed the importance of separating fact from fiction. He questioned the young man's motives, his intent in weaving such a tale. The young man, his voice wavering slightly, insisted that his story was merely an attempt to make sense of the inexplicable.

And so, deep in the heart of the remote wilderness cabin, surrounded by the dense forest, the mystery of the death remained unsolved. The truth, like the shifting shadows in the moonlit night, eluded those who sought it. The young man, forever changed by his encounter with the enigmatic cabin and its inhabitants, left with more questions than answers. And the coroner, burdened with the responsibility of uncovering the truth, continued his relentless pursuit of justice, determined to uncover the secrets that lay hidden within the wilderness.",1,0.0
"Title: The Interconnected Web of Life: Understanding the Need for Conservation

Introduction:
Conservation efforts have never been more crucial than in a world grappling with the consequences of environmental degradation. It is imperative that individuals develop an ethical outlook towards the environment, recognizing that disrupting the natural flow of nutrients in ecosystems can have far-reaching consequences. By understanding and appreciating the interconnectedness of different organisms, we can recognize the value of every living being and the vital role they play in maintaining biodiversity. This essay delves into the importance of conservation, emphasizing the need for a shift in attitudes and actions to protect the delicate balance of our ecosystems.

Body:

1. The Consequences of Disrupting Nutrient Flows:
Ecosystems operate in a delicate balance, where the exchange of nutrients between organisms is vital for their survival. When this flow is disrupted, it can have profound and long-lasting consequences. For instance, deforestation not only destroys habitats but also disrupts nutrient cycling, leading to soil erosion and reduced fertility. This, in turn, affects plant growth and the availability of resources for other organisms, creating a domino effect throughout the ecosystem. Understanding the direct and indirect impacts of disrupting nutrient flows highlights the necessity for conservation efforts.

2. Interconnectedness of Different Organisms:
Every organism, no matter how seemingly insignificant, plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance of ecosystems. From microscopic bacteria that break down organic matter to apex predators at the top of the food chain, each organism has a unique role to fulfill. For example, bees, through their pollination services, facilitate the reproduction of numerous plant species, which sustains diverse ecosystems. Recognizing the interconnected web of life helps us appreciate the importance of all organisms and the devastating consequences that can result from their depletion.

3. Negative Attitudes towards Predators:
Certain animals, particularly predators, often face negative attitudes rooted in fear or lack of understanding. However, these animals are an indispensable part of ecosystems, serving as regulators of population dynamics and maintaining the balance of nature. Wolves, for instance, play a critical role in preventing overgrazing by herbivores, thereby preserving the health of plant communities. The depletion of predator populations has cascading effects throughout ecosystems, leading to imbalances, reduced biodiversity, and in some cases, ecological collapse. Overcoming negative attitudes towards predators is essential to conserving the delicate harmony of ecosystems.

4. Impact of Depleting Predator Populations:
The depletion of predator populations, caused by hunting, habitat loss, or misguided eradication efforts, can have severe consequences for ecosystems. For example, the decline in shark populations, largely driven by the shark fin trade, has resulted in the proliferation of their prey, such as rays and skates. This, in turn, has led to increased pressure on shellfish populations, causing disruptions in marine food chains. Recognizing the intricacies of these interconnected relationships underscores the urgency of conserving predator populations.

5. Shifting Attitudes and Actions towards Conservation:
To protect biodiversity and maintain the health of our ecosystems, a fundamental shift in attitudes and actions towards conservation is necessary. This requires fostering a sense of environmental ethics, where individuals regard nature as deserving of respect and protection. Education and awareness-raising efforts can help dispel misconceptions and highlight the myriad benefits that biodiversity provides. Incorporating conservation principles into policy-making, land management, and resource allocation is also paramount in protecting and restoring ecosystems.

Conclusion:

Conservation is no longer a choice but a moral imperative in a world facing escalating environmental challenges. Understanding the interconnectedness of ecosystems and the consequences of disrupting nutrient flows is crucial in realizing the importance of conservation. By recognizing the value of every organism and overcoming negative attitudes towards certain animals, such as predators, we can work towards preserving biodiversity and safeguarding the delicate balance of nature. A collective shift in attitudes and actions towards conservation is not only necessary for the survival of countless species but also for the sustainability of our own existence. It is our responsibility to embrace an ethical outlook and ensure a harmonious coexistence with the interconnected web of life.",1,0.0
"di catrame vicino, a specchio dell’acqua grassa e filigginosa del porto. Non erano uomini: erano resti d’uomini. Poco o molto della loro carne era già sotterra, ma glie n’era rimasta tanta da poter mangiare, bere, digerire, ridere e bestemmiare: scampati miracolosamente alle carezze dei magli, dei repulsori, degli ingranaggi, delle ruote, delle locomotive, affettati nei più strani e crudeli modi, ma liberati anche per sempre dalla pesante croce del lavoro e dei doveri sociali, vegetavano allegramente lì su quelle panche, appuntellati con le loro gruccie, agitando i loro moncherini, veri scampoli della grande merceria umana, come li aveva battezzati l’oste filosofo. Quest’oste era un marchigiano, calafato un tempo, che aveva avute spezzate le due braccia da un argano, a Cape-Town. La Castle-Line glie le aveva pagate in contanti sterline, in ragione di cento l’una, e lui aveva súbito venduto i ferri del suo vecchio mestiere e s’era imbarcato nel primo piroscafo per Buenos Aires, col gruzzolo, la poca roba, e una certa sua pallottola di moglie che vedeva il mondo non già roseo bensì addirittura rubicondo come la sua propria faccia; e rideva anche dormendo. Ma anche la ossuta e adusta faccia di lui riluceva lasciando la terra d’Africa, poichè il sogno di tutta la sua vita di emigrante era raggiunto; poteva finalmente aprire un’osteria alla Boca di Buenos Aires, dove aveva fatto la fame per due lunghi anni. N’era partito disperato e ora ci ritornava capitalista. Senza braccia, sì: ma a che servono le braccia a un capitalista! Per contare i quattrini gli sarebbero bastati gli occhi; per farli cadere dentro il cassetto del suo banco da oste gli sarebbero bastati i suoi complessivi quaranta centimetri di moncherini che gli sbucavano dalle maniche rimboccate della sua giacchetta, simiglianti con la loro cucitura fresca a due germanici salami d’oca. Del resto egli si sarebbe serbato la parte direttiva dell’impresa; due bei bracciotti grassi e robusti al servizio del suo cervello di aspirante milionario, li avrebbe sempre avuti: erano quelli della sua ridente pallottola che egli soleva chiamare inglesemente _Bullet_ e amava ora come non aveva amato mai. Poichè quella sciagura delle braccia doveva aver anche richiamato sulla singolare coppia una nuova luna di miele, anzi addirittura un plenilunio di miele. Un ebreo polacco commerciante di oggetti di gomma e schiave bianche, il quale s’era trovato a fare il viaggio da Cape-Town a Buenos Aires sullo stesso vapore, mi raccontava che era stato commosso fino alle lacrime da questo idillio di nuovo genere, durato ventiquattro giorni ininterrotti. Fosse la compassione materna per quel povero diavolo che aveva ormai bisogno di essere vestito e imboccato come un bambino d’un anno, fosse l’aspetto nuovo e quasi favoloso che davano a suo marito quelle duecento sterline cucite intorno alla pancia in una ventriera di tela da barche; certo è che _Bullet_ non aveva distolto un solo istante gli occhi amorosi dal suo Otello. Otello, così si chiamava lui, stava tutto il giorno sul castello di prua, comodamente disteso sopra una seggiola pieghevole che _Bullet_ aveva voluto comprargli con i suoi segreti risparmi di pettinatrice: mangiava, beveva, fumava la pipa, costruiva il suo avvenire guardando fisso nel mezzo delle nuvole, passava beatamente dal monologo al sonno, sicuro che la sua _Bullet_ non lasciava il suo posto di guardia seduta sopra una gomena, davanti alla sua preziosa pancia cinta della loro fortuna. Per imboccarlo, _Bullet_ veniva a sedersi ridendo sulle sue ginocchia, soffiava sulla minestra, l’assaggiava prima di dargliela, come una buona mamma, gli mondava le banane, gli vuotava in corpo numerosi bicchieri di vino. Finito di mangiare parlavano e ridevano un buon poco, rimanendo così, lei seduta sulle ginocchia di lui; parlavano del loro avvenire che egli costruiva anno su anno, con un progressivo sfoggio di fantasia milionaria, che dava le vertigini alla ridente pallottola di ciccia. Quando Otello s’era esaurito, puntava contro la sua _Bullet_ i suoi due moncherini, ed essa ci si buttava in mezzo ridendo e baciandolo sul viso. Allora, sottovoce, per non essere udito, egli le diceva: — Tiemmi di conto, sai, _Bullet_, perchè il tesoro vero non è quello che ci ho intorno alla pancia, è quello che ci ho nel cervello! Vedrai! tra dieci anni, duecento sterline te le voglio mettere all’orecchio a te! — E _Bullet_ stralunava gli occhi dal gran gusto. Una volta il mio ebreo polacco colse, non visto, quest’altro brano di idillio. _Bullet_, carezzando la testa e il collo bruno del suo Otello, gli sussurrava dolcemente: — Ti ricordi quando mi dicevi: «Se tu mi tradissi, io farei come quell’altro Otello, ti strozzerei!». E adesso, sentiamo un po’, se ti tradissi, che cosa mi faresti? — E qui una gran risata. Dal modo come Otello aveva guardato la sua cicciuta Desdemona, si capiva bene che da tempo immemorabile non aveva pensato ad una simile possibilità, tuttavia bestemmiò torvamente per dare una intonazione terribile alla sua prossima risposta; e finalmente disse: — Adesso ti mangerei tutta, come un lupo. — Ah! sempre lui, il mio Otellino! — aveva strillato la donna, — quanto mi piaci! — E gli aveva appiccicato due improvvisi baci sugli occhi ancora minacciosi, sì che lui aveva dovuto chiuderli e ridere. Così erano arrivati a Buenos Aires. E prima ancora che egli avesse trovato quella tale osteria da rilevare, che facesse al caso suo, gli s’eran messi d’intorno, per naturale gravitazione, cinque o sei storpiati, come lui, non dalla natura, ma dalle più svariate applicazioni meccaniche del genio umano. Questi erano tutti pensionati delle ferrovie, delle compagnie di navigazione, delle assicurazioni, delle società di mutuo soccorso; e così non avevano preoccupazione maggiore di quella del buon vino, e gli promisero di strascinarsi dietro tutti gli storpi della capitale, purchè il vino fosse sincero e l’osteria fosse in qualche modo intitolata a loro. Per incominciare, l’affare fu giudicato ottimo dall’oculato Otello, e in una notte di veglia febbrile il nome lo trovò: _Osteria degli Scampoli_. Questa mite ironia senza rimpianto fu approvata alla unanimità: si giudicò incapace di turbare l’allegria e la sete",0,0.0

But something about this girl made him curious, almost nervous. She hadn’t so much as stirred since E peeked into Sebastian’s bedroom. E stretched out his hand to pull back the hair covering her face. His hand had barely moved when Sebastian walked in with a thermos of coffee in his hand. E retreated to his room across the hall as if he had done something to the girl that deserved a beating. Through the keyhole, his detective work began. He observed as Sebastian moved the girl onto his bed and woke her with gentle crooning. When she had composed herself, she departed with a brief kiss for Sebastian and her curvy body hidden under a baggy sweatshirt. When Sebastian closed his bedroom door, E decided his detective work couldn’t stop there. He grabbed his windbreaker, and slid noiselessly from his room and down the steps behind her. Keeping his distance, E trailed behind her down the street lined with tight townhouses. When she stopped at a magazine vender, she greeted the man by name, and he returned the greeting with a Good day, Becca. Now he was getting somewhere. E took his detective work very seriously. There was something strange about this girl and he would figure it out, even if he died in the process. She continued down the street with Teen People in her hand. E found it rather difficult to keep up with her; darting through the crowded sidewalk, moving his still-growing legs twice as fast as her long, muscular legs. All this and remaining stealthy was difficult for a clumsy seven-year-old. Finally, she ducked into a coffee house. E would soon find that Becca worked as a waitress in the cozy, dusty-aired coffee shop. Fortunately for E, who was on a tight schedule, as his parents would return home from their night shifts soon, Becca merely stopped to check her schedule for the week. While E waited behind a particularly plump man, he watched a car wreck unfold before his eyes out on the street. By the time Becca emerged from the back room, sirens and screams filled the air with chaos. Becca casually strolled from the café as if nothing was going on right in front of her. However, she did take notice of the car that had been pushed onto the sidewalk. It would have been difficult not to notice. E was overwhelmed by the goings-on of the busy street. A seven-year-old couldn’t help but be frightened at the ruckus that was unfolding: an old man yelling about his smashed-up car, a younger woman screaming in pain as the firemen pulled her from her vehicle, sirens, people gaping at the scene. E didn’t know where to turn, and he had nearly lost sight of Becca. He bolted toward her and before he realized what he was doing, his hand slid into her slender fingers. She jumped a little, then smiled at the strawberry-blonde, freckle-faced, little boy staring up at her. Becca crouched and asked his name. E Markham, he replied, thoroughly relieved to have somebody there with him. Becca recognized the name at once and said she’d take him home. And so they walked, hand in hand, past the wreck, through the thickening crowd. E was no longer scared. It was as if Becca made everything better, just by smiling. As they walked the ten blocks back to E’s house, he learned that Becca had quite a sense of humor. He could understand why Sebastian liked her so much. She was able to make E laugh without talking to him like he was a baby. E got the baby talk way too often. Oddly enough, Becca didn’t even inquire as to why E was so far from home at such an early hour of the morning. E was more than fine with that. He’d rather not have had to explain why he was following her. However, she did ask about Sebastian. E had nothing but good stories about his brother. He was the typical little brother: annoying, clingy, and hyperactive, but he was well aware of that, and the first to admit it. E had an extreme amount of respect for Sebastian. He told Becca of the times when Sebastian took him bicycle riding. He even mentioned the nights that Sebastian would read to him before bed, or the thunderstorms when E would run across the hall, and Sebastian would be waiting for him, a warm place in his bed to keep him safe. Much to E’s surprise, Becca didn’t seem taken aback by these stories. Sure, E had an undying affection for Sebastian, but E also thought that girls liked his brother because he played football and was popular at school. E had never known a girl to like Sebastian for being the guy that he knew and loved. He slowly began to grasp a deeper understanding of his big brother. As they climbed the six stairs leading to the front door of the townhouse, E asked Becca to come inside. She agreed and walked comfortably back upstairs, closely following E. He fully expected her to enter the room opposite his and was prepared to thank her for escorting him home. But, much to his surprise, and liking, she chose to visit E’s war zone. She sat on the floor, which doubled",0,0.0

"Man, let me tell you, personal relationships can be such a rollercoaster. Drama seems to follow me everywhere I go, and trust issues just make it worse. It's exhausting!

So, here's the deal. I've got this group of friends, and while we have a blast most of the time, there's always something brewing in the background. It's like we can't just enjoy each other's company without some sort of drama popping up. I mean, come on! Can't we just have one drama-free hangout? Is that too much to ask for?

And don't even get me started on trust issues. It's like everyone has them nowadays. I understand that people have been hurt in the past, but it's frustrating to constantly have to prove yourself. I mean, if you can't trust me, why are we even friends? It's mind-boggling, really.

Oh, but let's talk about partying for a second. I used to be all about hitting the clubs and staying out until sunrise. But lately, I've been feeling a bit over it. The whole scene just seems so repetitive and shallow. Plus, there's always some drama waiting to happen at these parties. I'm tired of dealing with the aftermath of people's drunken antics and the random hookups that lead to awkward mornings.

But hey, amidst all this frustration, there's a glimmer of excitement on the horizon. My family is planning a vacation, and man, I can't wait! We're headed to the beach, and I'm already dreaming of sunshine, waves, and building sandcastles. It's going to be a much-needed break from all this drama and chaos in my life.

I'm really looking forward to spending quality time with my family. We've had our disagreements and issues in the past, but at the end of the day, they're my rock. They always have my back, no matter what. Sometimes, you need that stability in your life, you know?

I guess the older I get, the more I appreciate the simple things. I'm tired of the drama, the trust issues, and the chaotic party scene. I just want to surround myself with people who genuinely care about me and have a good time without all the unnecessary drama.

So, while I may be dealing with my fair share of frustration, I'm also looking forward to this family vacation. It's going to be a chance to reconnect, recharge, and remind myself of what truly matters. And who knows, maybe when I come back, I'll be ready to reassess my friendships and make some changes.

But for now, I'll just put on my sunglasses, soak up the sun, and leave the drama behind. Life's too short to waste it on people who don't appreciate you and experiences that drain your energy. Bring on the family vacation, I'm ready for some well-deserved relaxation and good vibes!",1,0.0
"Be sure to wear some flowers in your hair. I left my heart is San Francisco. Um...let's see...what other songs are there about San Francisco. Oh yeah, ""Rice-aroni, a San Francisco treat. Ding, ding!"" I had such a great time in San Francisco. I don't know where to begin. I guess I could start with the fact that I almost missed my flight. I set my alarm, but after it went off, I thought I would lay in bed for an extra 5 minutes or so. Well, 5 minutes turned into a half hour. I probably would not have waken up had my mom not called. I made it with time to spare (but not as much as I would have liked). I had a few stops to make along the way. I had to change planes in Albequerque. I also had to make a stop in Las Vegas (I didn't get off the plane, though). When I finally made it to Oakland Airport (Southwest doesn't fly into San Francisco), I was greeted by my parents, Sonia's friend Angie, and my grandpa. That was a nice surprise, because I didn't know that he was coming. We then drove to our hotel in a suburb of SF, near the SF airport (where everyone else was flying into). Mike and Sonia were already there. After getting settled in, we headed for Downtown San Francisco; my parents and Gramps in the van and us in the ""clown car"" (we took two vehicles because we would be going our separates ways for the evening entertainment). So the clown car, as we so lovingly referred to, was this tiny red Suzuki Aerio hatchback. It just looked really funny, especially with Mike driving. So we headed for Fisherman's Wharf (the touristy part of town). We ate a late lunch (or an early dinner) at this nice restaurant that overlooked the bay and Alcatraz. It was interesting to watch the fog roll in. I never realized how foggy it would be. It's because the warm weather in the vallies draws in the cooler air from the ocean. Where the two meet, creates the fog (a little meteorology lesson for you all). After eating, we walked down the Wharf a bit to Ghiradelli Square. There were so many vendors selling all sorts of things, from fresh seafood, to art, to jewelry, and all sorts of things. There were many different street performers. We saw the nearly famous ""Bushman"". He's a guy that hides behind some branches and tries to scare unsuspecting bypassers. He's been doing this for 25 years and has even been sued a few times (but never lost a case). Later, we took a little drive up Russian Hill (the steepest hill in SF) and down Lombard Street (the crazy zig-zag street). After that little adventure, it was time to head to the ballpark for the Giants/Padres game. SBC park is a beautiful stadium. We had pretty good seats along the 3rd base line. It had turned quite cold by then. We left after the 7th inning. The Giants were losing anyways. It was back to the hotel after that. Angie and I got in the hot tub to warm up and ease our sore muscles. Thursday morningstarted out with breakfast at the Millbrae Pancake House. We then traveled to Palo Alto, CA to see the campus of Stanford University. This is a very beautiful campus. The church is gorgeous. I got a Stanford t-shirt from the campus bookstore. After Stanford, we headed north, across the Golden Gate Bridge, to Sausalito. You could barely even see the bridge because of the fog. Sausalito is a quaint little town with a lot of shops and art galleries. It reminded me a lot of Charlevoix, MI. Next, we headed back into town, to the Wharf area and Pier 39. We met up with the last two members of our group, Brian Michelle. They didn't arrive until late Wednesday night. We ate dinner at one of the many restaurants in the Wharf (one that had more than just seafood since I'm not its biggest fan). After dinner, we went to Alcatraz. This was really cool - one of the many highlights of the trip. Since the tour was at night and it was really cold and foggy, the tour was a bit creepy. Friday started with another trip to the Pancake House. After breakfast we headed to Napa, CAand wine country. This is where we parted with my parents and grandpa. They went on to Sacramento, CA. We toured two vinyards and wineries - Robert Mondavi and Beringer. We tasted wine at both. I tasted the wine that was included with the tours, but I didn't particularily care for any of it. I did get to eat a couple of the grapes during the Mondavi tour as part of a demonstration. I think Sonia and Angie may have had a bit too much wine at the Beringer Vinyards. I do have to say that both vinyards, in fact, the whole valley was absolutely beautiful.We ate dinner in North Beach (the Italian part of town) at a restaurant called Firenze By Night. The food was excellent. Saturday (our last full day) we paired off and did our own things. Angie and I explored downtown San Francisco. We first walked around the farmer's market located on one of the piers. Then we took a trolley tour around the city (it sure beat walking up and down all those hills). The tour started out at the Wharf, then made its first stop at the Palace of Fine Arts/Exploratorium. The gardens there were absolutely beautiful. It felt like walking through some ancient ruins. There were atleast three wedding parties taking pictures and one actual wedding. Our final stops were at Fort Point and the Golden Gate Bridge. Unfortunately, due to the heavy fog, you could barely even SEE the bridge (even when standing right next to it). The last half of the tour",0,0.0
"In today's world, the pursuit of personal wealth and financial success often takes precedence in our lives. We are constantly bombarded with advertisements and media messages that reinforce the idea that personal wealth is the ultimate measure of success and happiness. While financial security is undoubtedly significant, it is essential to recognize the importance of contributing to societal wealth and the numerous benefits it brings.

Societal wealth refers to the collective prosperity and well-being of a community or society as a whole. It encompasses a wide range of factors, including economic growth, quality of life, access to education and healthcare, and the overall development of infrastructure and institutions. When individuals focus solely on personal wealth accumulation, they overlook the larger picture and neglect their responsibility to contribute to the betterment of society.

One of the most significant advantages of contributing to societal wealth is the opportunity for personal growth. By actively participating in activities that promote societal well-being, individuals gain a broader perspective on the challenges faced by others and develop empathy and compassion. This expanded worldview allows for personal transformation and growth, leading to a more fulfilling and meaningful life.

Furthermore, contributing to societal wealth often leads to improved living conditions for oneself and others. When individuals invest their time, resources, and expertise in initiatives that aim to enhance societal well-being, they contribute to the development of a more prosperous and inclusive community. This, in turn, creates a positive cycle where the benefits of societal wealth are shared among its members.

Historically, we can see numerous examples of individuals who made significant contributions to societal wealth and reaped the benefits. Take philanthropists like Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller, who amassed immense personal fortunes but recognized the importance of giving back. They established foundations and donated vast sums of money to causes such as education, healthcare, and public libraries, which continue to benefit society to this day. These individuals understood that personal wealth alone could not bring lasting happiness and fulfillment; it was through their contributions to societal wealth that they made a meaningful impact.

Moreover, contributing to societal wealth can also lead to the creation of new opportunities. When individuals invest their time and resources into initiatives that aim to address societal challenges, they often find themselves at the forefront of innovation and progress. For example, individuals who contribute to renewable energy projects can play a crucial role in shaping the future of sustainable development and may even discover new technologies or business opportunities along the way.

It is important to note that contributing to societal wealth does not necessarily require vast financial resources. Small, meaningful actions can have a significant impact as well. Volunteering for charitable organizations, mentoring young individuals, or even engaging in discussions and debates can contribute to the collective wealth of society. By actively participating in the issues that affect society, individuals can contribute their unique perspectives and skills, fostering a more diverse and inclusive environment.

In conclusion, while personal wealth and financial success are undeniably important, it is equally crucial to recognize and contribute to societal wealth. By actively participating in initiatives that promote societal well-being, individuals not only experience personal growth but also contribute to improved living conditions for themselves and others. History has shown us that those who make significant contributions to societal wealth often reap the benefits in terms of personal fulfillment, opportunities, and a lasting impact on society. Therefore, it is essential for individuals to find causes that resonate with them and actively engage in actions that contribute to the betterment of society.",1,0.0
"Norv Turner's coaching career in the NFL spans several decades and includes both successes and challenges. Known for his offensive prowess, Turner has made notable contributions as both an offensive coordinator and head coach for various teams.

Turner's journey in the NFL began in the mid-1980s when he joined the Los Angeles Rams as an assistant coach.

"we've been doing for ten years!"" Rocco was beginning to work himself into one of his famous rages. His bull neck was beginning to redden; his eyes started to flash. His entire squat body started to quiver. Whitemarsh wasn't impressed. Over at the atomic plant, Phobus's Quercus Mountain, he had bossed a pretty quarrelsome crew of isotope wranglers. He had never dodged a fight in his life. But this was in a chemical laboratory and it surprised him to hear the assistants talk back. The only assistants he had ever known were clear-eyed youths taking a year away from their studies to recoup their tuition money and who tried to copy everything the chemists did. But Whitemarsh was new to the Interspatial Research Center on the Moon, and he still could not figure why the assistants acted as they did. So he waited. Rocco banged the flask down on the stone bench, glared at Whitemarsh for an instant, and then rushed out of the Laboratory, muttering a few obscenities. ""Queer place this,"" mused Whitemarsh, filling up another flask and finishing the titration himself. ""Here the helpers tell the chemists what to do and get mad if we ask them what they're doing."" He started to look over Rocco's notes and ruefully decided all the work would have to be done over again. He was interrupted when a girl opened the door. In the week he had been stationed at IRC, he had been introduced to so many scientists that he had forgotten most of the names, but he remembered all the girls. His former Atomic Plant at Quercus Mountain had had all too few for him not to appreciate them now. Miss Sally Chester was a statuesque chemist with long blonde hair and a luscious figure which she hid under a white lab robe. He managed to stammer some sort of greeting. ""Why Dr. Whitemarsh!"" She seemed somewhat puzzled. ""You're not actually working with your hands?"" ""I sure am, unless we're both space struck. Why not?"" ""Well, I suppose it's all right other places, here we let the Laboratorians do all the manual work. It's sort of their privilege."" ""Yes, but their technique's lousy. I sat here this afternoon and watched that blow-hard Rocco muff six straight end-points in a row and when I asked him how come, he blew his top!"" She laughed at that. She sat down on the lab desk and said, ""You're absolutely right. Antonio Rocco's color blind and always misses his Methyl Orange end-points. And he's been doing them for ten years. But it hurts his feelings to be criticized, you should have been more diplomatic. He's probably gone to complain to his boss!"" ""His boss? Aren't we his bosses? On this sheet he's listed as my assistant."" ""Actually yes. But traditionally the shop foreman is the leader of the Laboratorians. He certifies them to see that they know their work, signs their time cards and tells them when to take time off. Of course we outline the work they do, check their results and write reports from their data. Normally we come into the lab as little as possible."" ""But Sally, how the hell do we know that their results are right? This mixed-up outfit is in the hands of a bunch of left-handed prima donnas who don't know Beilstein from Budweiser!"" She smiled again (and he thought of the ads for Stargleam toothpaste). ""Let's go over to the Scientists' Snack Bar and get a cup of coffee, and I'll tell you a little about the history of this laboratory."" So he let her lead him out of the individual laboratory into the pastel blue corridor where they followed the spiral runways to the glass enclosed Snack Bar. Here they sat on pale leather chairs and looked out over the expanse of the Central Laboratory. From where he sat, he could see a square mile of magnificent equipment: Serpentine condensers, enormous distillation columns, molecular stills, ultra-centrifuges, electron microscopes, all were spread out before him. Surrounding the central laboratory were the innumerable railings of the corridors leading to the individual offices. Upstairs and downstairs strolled scientists and Laboratorians respectively, all obviously contented. He turned to face Miss Chester who was lolling in the chair beside him. She had poured him a cup of coffee, given him a plate of rolls and was ready to talk. She reminded him that in 2005 it was found necessary to build research laboratories on the Moon to avoid the guided meteorites which the Aliens had been hurling toward the Earth. Since there had also been a shortage of trained scientists, it was necessary to train apprentices to operate the complicated laboratory equipment ... to perform the operations without bothering themselves with the theory. The Laboratorians were needed and they did a good job running specification tests on all the equipment necessary for the interplanetary war. After the war, the Interspatial Corporation had made it the Central Research Laboratory, since this had been the largest aggregation of instruments ever gathered together, and in the ten intervening years, the numbers of college-trained scientists had increased almost ten-fold. As long as the Laboratorians confined their work to the equipment they were familiar with, they were unbeatable. To guide them they had the Book, as the Technical Manual of the Interspatial Corporation was known, and the Laboratorians followed its procedures to the letter. ""But they don't know _why_ they're doing things,"" Whitemarsh interrupted. ""The manual's been in need of revision for the last five years, and research workers don't use the same tests all the time!"" ""Well that's right,"" admitted Sally without disagreement. ""I usually have my particular laboratory instructions mimeotyped and bound in a little book. I've also got the instructions so fixed that if they do things wrong, I can catch them. And I've learned not to modify my instructions orally. That only confuses the men and results in chaos. With a little planning, you can get good work done, and",0,0.0

Much has been written about him which has had little or no foundation in truth. It seems, then, worth while, in order to prevent false or mistaken reports from being accepted as trustworthy, and in order to provide for the public such information concerning Mr. Kipling as it has a right to possess, that a correct and authoritative statement of the chief events in his life should be given to it. This is the object of the following brief narrative. * * * * * Rudyard Kipling was born at Bombay on the 30th of December, 1865. His mother, Alice, daughter of the Rev. G. B. Macdonald, a Wesleyan preacher, eminent in that denomination, and his father, John Lockwood Kipling, the son also of a Wesleyan preacher, were both of Yorkshire birth. They had been married in London early in the year, and they named their first-born child after the pretty lake in Staffordshire on the borders of which their acquaintance had begun. Mr. Lockwood Kipling, after leaving school, had served his apprenticeship in one of the famous Staffordshire potteries at Burslem, had afterward worked in the studio of the sculptor, Mr. Birnie Philip, and from 1861 to 1865 had been engaged on the decorations of the South Kensington Museum. During our American war and in the years immediately following, the trade of Bombay was exceedingly flourishing, the city was immensely prosperous, a spirit of inflation possessed the Government and the people alike, there were great designs for the improvement and rebuilding of large portions of the town, and a need was felt for artistic oversight and direction of the works in hand and contemplated. The distinction which Mr. Lockwood Kipling had already won by his native ability and thorough training led to his being appointed in 1865 to go to Bombay as the professor of Architectural Sculpture in the British School of Art which had been established there. It was thus that Rudyard Kipling came to be born in the most cosmopolitan city of the Eastern world, and it was there and in its neighbourhood that the first three years of the boy's life were spent, years in which every child receives ineffaceable impressions, shaping his conceptions of the world, and in which a child of peculiarly sensitive nature and active disposition, such as this boy possessed, lies open to myriad influences that quicken and give colour to the imagination. In the spring of 1868 he was taken by his mother for a visit to England, and there, in the same year, his sister was born. In the next year his mother returned to India with both her children, and the boy's next two years were spent at and near Bombay. He was a friendly and receptive child, eager, interested in all the various entertaining aspects of life in a city which, ""gleaning all races from all lands,"" presents more diversified and picturesque varieties of human condition than any other, East or West. A little incident which his mother remembers is not without a pretty allegoric significance. It was at Nasik, on the Dekhan plain, not far from Bombay: the little fellow trudging over the ploughed field, with his hand in that of the native husbandman, called back to her in the Hindustani, which was as familiar to him as English, ""Good-bye, this is my brother."" In 1871 Mr. and Mrs. Kipling went with their children to England, and being compelled to return to India the next year, they took up the sorrow common to Anglo-Indian lives, in leaving their children ""at home,"" in charge of friends at Southsea, near Portsmouth. It was a hard and sad experience for the boy. The originality of his nature and the independence of his spirit had already become clearly manifest, and were likely to render him unintelligible and perplexing to whosoever might have charge of him unless they were gifted with unusual perceptions and quick sympathies. Happily his mother's sister, Mrs. (now Lady) Burne-Jones, was near at hand, in case of need, to care for him. In the spring of 1877 Mrs. Kipling came to England to see her children, and was followed the next year by her husband. The children were removed from Southsea, and Rudyard, grown into a companionable, active-minded,",0,0.0
"my office, Michaels, just as soon as you get back from Eros. Eros? WHAT IN HELL ARE YOU DOING ON EROS? Horrocks * * * * * ROCKET MAIL (First Class) Mr. H. E. Horrocks Dear Balloon Brain: If you paid a little more attention to your office and less to that golf course on Venus, you'd know what I am doing on Eros. I got here two days ago via Mars with a herd of six wrestlers, in accordance with your own written memorandum. We were to appear at an Auruchs club smoker. Upon arrival, I found that no preparations had been made for us and nobody knows anything about an Auruchs club. The people here are nuts. They talk in six syllable words and their idea of a good time is to sniff flowers and do five dimensional calculus. They have less use for wrestlers than I have for you. Michaels * * * * * ROCKET MAIL (Second Class) Michaels, you nitwit: That wasn't _Eros_, you idiot! You were supposed to go to _Erie_--Erie, Pa., right here on Earth! If you remembered even your sixth grade Solar System history, you would know that the planetoid Eros was settled in 2141 by a group of longhairs headed by Prof. M. R. Snock, a philosopher with a dozen university degrees. He wanted to show that war, crime and all forms of violence would disappear if people thought only beautiful thoughts. The planetoid is lousy rich with erydnium ore and the people keep in luxury selling it to space freighters. They spend their time being gentle and thinking beautiful. There hasn't even been a spitball thrown there in eight generations. A _fine_ place for you to show up mahouting six wrestlers with no foreheads. You're lucky they haven't thrown you in jail. Horrocks * * * * * ROCKET MAIL (Postage Due) Mr. H. E. Horrocks Dear Jellyhead: What do you mean lucky? We _are_ in jail. Right after we got here, the boys decided they had been cramped in that local spaceship and needed a workout to limber up. As soon as they got started, they were surrounded by a bunch of scrawny males, all sniffing hollyhocks. Their spokesman, a bald bird with rosebuds in his whiskers, touched me with a gold-headed cane and said that apparently we were not yet attuned to the high mental plane of the planetoid, and would we mind going into protective custody while they worked over our egos and cured our kineticism. I said suppose we wouldn't. He looked shocked and waved his flower and said that then, although it had never happened before, he supposed he would have to call the space patrol and have us thrown into the hoosegow on Ganymede. I translated that into basic wrestler for the boys and we agreed we'd better go along. We'd heard about the jail those tough space patrol babies operate on Ganymede. The flower lovers took us to an old erydnium pit and asked us to please go down. Now they're perfuming us every hour and feeding us flower bulbs to make us gentle. We could climb out of this rat-hole whenever we wanted, but that would be climbing straight into a striped spacesuit. I think about you all the time. And if you think they're beautiful thoughts, you're as crazy as I've always suspected. Michaels P.S. The boys asked that I enclose this note from them: Dear Mr. Horox: We do not like it here Mr. Horox. The Grub is no good. You come get us. Plese Mr. Horox. Come soon.

Zbich and the Gorilla Man worked out on headlocks, Gorgeous Gordon did calisthenics, and Barefoot Charley, Choker Jonas and the Faceless Wonder got themselves into a grunting free-for-all. After that got under way, I heard a squeal and a girl came bounding down the pit side. She was young and dark-haired and pretty. She might have been as intellectual as the president of Harvard above the shoulders, but what a framework she had to hold up that brain! She went over to Gorgeous Gordon and she said, ""Ooh!"" With all the flower lovers around here, it was probably the first man with muscles she had ever seen. The big ham swelled up. He flexed his arms and stuck out his chest. ""OOH!"" said the girl, and went bounding back up the side of the pit. I stopped the exercise and the wrestlers sat and mused blankly at each other. In a few minutes, our little visitor was back again. With her were about a dozen pals, differing in details, but resembling her in the important points. The leader was a tall, brown-haired, gray-eyed girl, with a face where intellect fought a losing battle with a dimple. The others helped her down the pit side as if she were something fragile and precious, like maybe a new bottle of perfume. Then our pal went back to Gorgeous Gordon.

"My brother has been feeding me these ridiculous-but-true facts all day now (I am guessing he was literally saving them for a rainy day)... and there was one that really stuck out in my mind. That of the British-Zanzibar War, the shortest war in history. So I decided to google this so-called war to find out more about it. What I found was an intriguing journal entry written by the incredibly mysterious Sultan of Zanzibar. What follows is a series of fateful entries written on the day of the war. August 22, 6am Dearest Journal, today I have been appointed the SULTAN of ZANZIBAR! How sweet is that? Of course, given the circumstances of my appointment, I must take this job with merely a grin instead of a full-blown crescent moon smile. My father, the long-time Sultan Tad Storkensburg, died last night of irritable bowel syndrome. I think there was something in his Zanzibarian Burger that really disagreed with him. Alas, I mourn my father's gruesome and disgusting death, and I welcome my new title of Sultan! It's so much cooler than ""Saltine."" My first act as Sultan is to stand up to those awful Brits. The Brits and the Germans have been fighting over my island for years now, and I'm damn sick and tired of it. The Brits keep wanting this island so they can move into Africa, the Germans want this island so they can put a Volkswagon factory on it. Zanzibar is my homeland, as obscure and ridiculous as that sounds, and I will not let it slip into the hands of the straightbacks from the north! So, after speaking with Germany, they've decided to back me up as I stand up to the Brits. My dad had good relations with those limey bastards for years, but now that he's out of the way I'm gonna kick some ass! August 22, 1896 9am Dearest journal, I just declared war on the Brits. I know what you're thinking... I'm in office for three hours and I already declared war on the biggest nation in the world. Maybe I was a little hasty, but I stand by my decision. I declared war about twenty minutes ago, and I'm ready for whatever they are going to throw at me! I have 2,500 Arab troops ready and willing to be slaughtered for the well-being of Zanzibar. I also have this really boss gold cannon from 1658. Back in the day, I hear, we used to use this cannon for everything... we even fought off the Egyptians or something. But ever since then it's been sitting in front of the Zanzibarian Court House just collecting dust. I also got this sweet old ship... it's like a wooden viking boat. Only it's not a viking boat because vikings didn't come down here... often. August 22, 1896 9:05am Dear J-Dog, The British are pretty much surrounding the island with their large-ass ships. Any normal Sultan would be thinking he had made a mistake, but I know I'm doing the right thing. I will be the Sultan to end all Sultans! Let it be known that Reggie Storkensburg, The Sultan of Zanzibar, was the most courageous leader ever. With the exception of Jesus. Anyways, right now we are sort of waiting... my troops are just sitting on the beaches playing card games and volleyball and the British keep cocking their rifles at us. I hope something happens pretty soon, I have a tennis date with the Czar of Uberbeckingstand at noon. Did I spell his country right? Oh well, no one's gonna read this anyways. August 22, 1896 9:15am Shit! Snap! Dag! Holy flaming crap! The Brits have decided to start shooting cannon balls at my island! One shot took out 500 of my troops, who were in the middle of a round robin volleyball tournament on the north shore! I have decided to bring out my golden cannon, which I have named ""Fat Man."" I have three cannon balls, which I have named ""Little Boy."" Those Brits are going to have some trouble coming there way as soon as Fat Man shoots the Little Boys! August 22, 1896 9:25am This isn't going at all like I had planned. August 22, 1896 9:35am Okay, okay, okay, all of my troops are dead. That's what I get for hiring all these Arabs to do the job... everyone knows Arabs can't swim! My viking ship has been totally destroyed, even worse they spray painted a giant space gun on the side of it before they set it on fire. Those British sure do know how to make you feel stupid. Although I must stay that they aren't nearly as polite as everyone thinks. Let's just hope my cannon holds out! August 22, 1896 9:37am Murphy's Law kicked in... my uber-boss cannon just burst into flames! It's made of gold, how did this happen?! August 22, 1896 9:45am Dear Journal, you are now looking at the former Sultan of Zanzibar... that's right. I gave up. I couldn't take it anymore! The Brits had me backed up against the wall here. And so after 45 minutes of being pummeled by these jerks, I gave up. I kinda forgot that my population consisted of just 2,500 Arabs, and since they were all dead now... I figured I might as well cut my losses and live to rule another day. Luckily, my sausage-welding friends from Middle Europe, let me stay at their consulate. Those Germans are alright, ya know? I mean, they really know what they are doing, and I wouldn't be surprised if they really make a difference in the world. I'd stake my Sultan reputation on it. Anyways, goodbye my lovely journal... the Germans won't allow me to bring this into the consulate, so I must leave it on this board and float it out to sea. Maybe someday those Brits will find it and see all of the stuff I said about em. Won't they feel bad!",0,0.0
"I woke up in darkness, my eyes struggling to adjust to the absence of light. Confusion engulfed me as I tried to recall where I was and how I had ended up here. I instinctively reached out, my hands fumbling against the cold, rough surface surrounding me. It felt like... a closet.

Curiosity propelled me forward, even as a sense of unease tingled at the back of my mind. Pushing open the closet door, I stepped out into a room I had never seen before. The air felt different, the atmosphere strange. The room was filled with unfamiliar furniture, its design peculiar and futuristic. It was as if I had been transported to a world beyond my own time.

As I wandered around the room, taking in the strange fusion of modernity and elegance, my gaze fell upon a desk. There, sitting patiently, was a letter. Its presence seemed deliberate, as if it had been left for me to find.

I hesitated for a moment before shaking off my apprehension and cautiously picked up the letter. As I unfolded it, my heart raced, not knowing what secrets it held. The words on the paper were written in an elegant script that dated back to a time long past. Its contents were astonishing, to say the least.

""Dear Norman Hastings,

If you are reading this, it means you have stumbled upon my secret room from the future. Allow me to explain. My name is Professor Charles Whitman, and I have dedicated the last thirty years of my life to the study of time. Through countless experiments and research, I have uncovered the truth about time travel and its immeasurable potential.

Norman, you have unwittingly traveled into the future – the year 2004, to be precise. I can only imagine the confusion and disbelief you must be experiencing right now. I regret to inform you that there is no way for you to return to your own time. The mechanism responsible for this transportation was a one-way ticket.

While this news may be disheartening, I hope you will come to see the remarkable opportunity that has been bestowed upon you. You have been placed in a world that is both familiar and foreign, enabling you to witness the progress of humanity in a way no one else has ever had the chance to.

The room you find yourself in now is my sanctuary – a place where I can observe the evolution of society without interfering. The furniture around you is a collection of artifacts from different periods of time, all meticulously chosen to represent the advancements we have made over the years.

Feel free to explore the room and make yourself at home. It is my hope that this space will provide you with solace and comfort. Unfortunately, I cannot be there to guide you personally, as I am in a different location entirely.

I leave you with this final piece of advice: embrace the wonders of the future, Norman. Learn from the mistakes of the past and the achievements of the present. This world is yours to discover, and I have faith in your ability to navigate its mysteries.

Yours sincerely, Professor Charles Whitman.""

I sat back in the chair, the weight of the letter sinking into my mind. Time travel, a mysterious room, and a message from a stranger who had devoted his life to this field – it was beyond anything I could have ever fathomed. I struggled to comprehend the gravity of my situation, the implications of being indefinitely stranded in a different era.

As days turned into weeks, and weeks into months, I immersed myself in this new world. The room became my haven, the furniture and artifacts my companions. I studied them intently, admiring the craftsmanship, and marveling at the ingenuity of humankind. Each piece held a story, a glimpse into a past that no longer belonged to me.

Outside the room, the year 2004 unfolded with all its wonders and complexities. I witnessed the birth of groundbreaking technologies, the rise and fall of political movements, and the triumphs of human spirit. I became an observer, a silent witness to the ever-changing tapestry of existence.

Yet, despite the awe-inspiring sights I encountered, a part of me longed for my own time. I yearned for the familiarity of my loved ones and the comforts of the life I had known. The room, once a sanctuary, now served as a constant reminder of my isolation.

Years passed, and as I grew older, the world continued to evolve. It was during one of these lonely evenings that I stumbled upon an old photograph tucked away in a drawer. It was a picture of my family, taken many years before my fateful journey to the future. Tears welled up in my eyes as I traced the faces of my loved ones, realizing that they were now nothing more than distant memories.

In that moment, I made a decision. I would no longer dwell on the impossibility of returning to my own time. Instead, I would cherish the extraordinary opportunity that had been bestowed upon me. I would honor Professor Charles Whitman's legacy by embracing the wonders of the future and using my newfound knowledge to better understand the world around me.

And so, I continued my journey through time, guided by curiosity and a thirst for knowledge. The room that once held me captive became a symbol of hope and resilience. It became my portal to a future I had never anticipated, one that would shape me in ways I could never have imagined.",1,0.0
"In the small town of Kinesma, nestled on the banks of the majestic Volga River, life thrived a hundred years ago. The society was governed by Prince Alexis, a man of noble lineage who ruled with a firm but fair hand. His authority extended over the town and its surrounding lands, and his subjects looked up to him as their leader.

Prince Alexis was a man of great importance, and his every action and decision carried weight. His days were filled with meetings and discussions with his advisors and officials, as he strived to maintain harmony and balance within his domain. He took his role seriously, often consulting with his trusted council to ensure the well-being of his people. The power dynamics between the prince and his subjects were delicately balanced, with the prince acting as the ultimate arbiter of justice and governance.

But Prince Alexis was not alone in his rule. His wife, Princess Elena, was a strong and influential woman in her own right. She was well-educated and wielded a significant amount of influence over her husband's decisions. Her intelligence and wisdom were respected by both the prince and the townspeople, and she often acted as a voice of reason in the court.

Their son, Prince Dimitri, was being groomed to one day take his father's place. Although still young, he displayed the same sense of responsibility and leadership as his parents. Prince Dimitri was often seen by his father's side, learning the intricacies of governing and honing his skills as a future ruler. The people of Kinesma held high hopes for the young prince, believing that he would continue his family's legacy of wise and just rule.

Amidst the responsibilities of governance, the people of Kinesma also found joy in preparation for the annual festival that took place on the banks of the Volga River. It was a time for celebration and rejoicing, a time when the entire town came together to forget their worries and bask in the embrace of community. The festival marked a time of renewal and hope, as the warmth of spring began to awaken the dormant world.

Leading the festivities was a figure beloved by all – Simon Petrovitch, the court-poet. His words wove a magical tapestry, capturing the essence of the town and its people. Through his poetry, Simon painted vivid portraits of life along the Volga, immortalizing the spirit of Kinesma for generations to come. His verses resonated with the townspeople, serving as a reminder of their shared heritage and creating a sense of unity.

The physical setting of Kinesma was as captivating as its people. The palace, where Prince Alexis and his family resided, stood as a symbol of power and grandeur. Its ornate architecture and sprawling gardens were a testament to the wealth and prestige of its inhabitants. The nearby church, with its towering spires and melodious bells, offered solace to those seeking spiritual guidance. And beyond the town, the Volga River flowed majestically, serving as a lifeline for trade and communication.

Life in Kinesma, a hundred years ago, was a delicate dance of power, influence, and community. Prince Alexis's rule, guided by the wisdom of his wife and with the hope of his son's future, brought stability and prosperity to the town. The annual festival on the banks of the Volga River acted as a reminder of the people's shared heritage and created a sense of unity, while the court-poet, Simon Petrovitch, immortalized the town's spirit through his verses. As the river flowed and the town thrived, Kinesma embraced its past while looking towards a bright future.",1,0.0
"The Kobe foreign settlement (神戸外国人居留地, Kōbe gaikokujin kyoryūchi), also known as the Kobe foreign concession, was a foreign settlement located about 3.5 kilometers east of the Port of Kobe,[1] in the future Chūō-ku of Kobe, Japan. Established based on the Ansei Treaties, it existed from January 1, 1868, to July 16, 1899. The site was located between the Ikuta River [ja] to the east, the Koi River (鯉川) (site of a future thoroughfare) to the west, the sea to the south, and the Saigoku Kaidō (西国街道) highway to the north.[2] It had an area of 78,000 tsubo (about 25.8 hectares),[3] and was developed based on a logical urban plan. For these reasons, it has been praised as the ""best-planned foreign settlement in the Orient"".[4] Its extraterritoriality was acknowledged in some of its administrative and financial affairs, and it was managed by an autonomous organization structured with foreign residents (most of whom had interests in east-India company and/or associates) at its center. Its operation was smooth, and relations between the Japanese and foreign sides were generally favorable.[5] The settlement prospered as a gateway to Western culture and base of trade, spreading its economic and cultural influence to the surrounding areas as well.[6] On July 29, 1858, the Tokugawa shogunate entered into the Treaty of Amity and Commerce with the United States. In Article 6 of that treaty, the shogunate acknowledged the consular jurisdiction of the U.S. in Japan. In Article 3 it opened Hyōgo port as a treaty port from January 1, 1863, agreeing to establish a fixed area (foreign settlement) to be loaned to foreigners to reside and conduct economic activity in. Before long, the shogunate signed similar treaties known as the Ansei Treaties with the Netherlands, Russia, the United Kingdom, and France.[7] However, these treaties were unable to gain the approval of an imperial edict, and after negotiations with the foreign powers the opening of the port was delayed for five years, until January 1, 1868.[8] The court expressed disapproval for the opening of a port so close to the imperial palace in Kyoto,[9] and even after the Ansei Treaties were approved by imperial edict on December 22, 1865, approval for the port was still not granted.[10] On June 26, 1867, when the treaty port's scheduled opening was six months away, an imperial edict finally acknowledged its establishment.[11][12][† 1] Even before the issuance of this sanction, the shogunate had been conducting negotiations with the various foreign powers on the topic of the treaty port, and on May 16, 1867, it concluded an agreement[† 2] for the establishment of foreign settlements in Hyōgo and Osaka with Britain, the U.S., and France.[14] Article 1 of this agreement established that ""a foreign settlement will be established in Hyōgo, between Kōbe-machi (Kōbe-mura) and the Ikuta River, for residents of those countries which have such treaties with the Japanese government ...""[† 3][1][15] Thus, the foreign settlement was created at Kōbe-mura (神戸村), about 3.5 km east of the Port of Hyōgo.[1] In accordance with this, a new harbor was constructed on the coast at Kōbe-mura and opened to the foreign powers.[1] In 1892, an imperial edict named this harbor the Port of Kobe (神戸港, Kōbe-kō).[16] Existing documents do not record the reason or chain of events surrounding the opening of the Port of Kobe instead of the Port of Hyōgo.[1] Still, there are a number of theories. In Kokusai Toshi Kōbe no Keifu, Toshio Kusumoto guesses that the shogunate, mindful of the population's preference to keep foreigners at a distance[† 4] and wishing to avoid conflict, wanted to avoid opening the already bustling and prosperous port of Hyōgo.[† 5][18][† 6] Meanwhile, Shinshū Kōbe Shishi: Rekishi-hen 3 and Kokusai Toshi Kōbe no Keifu both conjecture that it was easier to secure a site in the less densely populated area around Kōbe-mura,[† 7] and this site also allowed the reappropriation of the Kobe Naval Training Center, which had shut down in 1865.[1] A November 1865 survey of the surrounding ocean by an attendant of the British envoy Harry Smith Parkes indicated that the area intended for the foreign settlement, somewhat removed from the old Hyōgo town center, looked out on a small bay that was sufficiently deep and provided an anchorage abundant in nature. Kokusai Toshi Kōbe no Keifu posits from this that this site was Kōbe-mura, and that the foreign powers also found this location more suitable than the existing port of Hyōgo.[21] In any case, in 1892, the port of Kobe was expanded to incorporate the old port of Hyōgo.[22][23] The final site of the foreign settlement was located within Kōbe-mura and framed by the Ikuta River to the east, Koi River to the west, and Pacific Ocean to the south, with the Saigoku Kaidō highway to the north.[† 8][2][27] It had an area of 78,000 tsubo[3] (about 0.26 km2). Shinshū Kōbe Shishi describes this selection as suggestive of the shogunate's consideration in minimizing contact between foreigners and Japanese to its utmost ability.[† 9][28] The Tokugawa shogunate dispatched Shibata Takenaka as magistrate of Hyōgo, putting him in charge of the creation of port and foreign settlement. Shibata immediately took over this task on his arrival in Kōbe-mura, but by January 1, 1868, when the port was to open, all that was complete was the Customs office, three wharfs, and three storehouses.[29][30] This was also the period during which the government transitioned from the shogunate to the Meiji government, and on November 9, 1867, Shōgun Tokugawa Yoshinobu officially tendered his resignation to the emperor. At first, business related to the port was left to the shogunate government,[31] but on January 3, two days after the port opened, the shogunate was completely abolished and power returned to the emperor. After the shogunate forces lost the Battle of Toba–Fushimi at the end of that January, Yoshinobu retreated from Osaka Castle to Edo, and with Shibata recalled to Edo as well, the construction had to be suspended.[32][33] The remainder of the construction was carried out under the Meiji government,[34][35]",0,0.0
"Mayhem stepped out of the spacecraft onto the foreign planet's surface, his boots sinking slightly into the soft soil. The air was thick with humidity, causing beads of sweat to form on his forehead almost immediately. He glanced around, taking in the sight of the indigenous people dressed in nothing but loin cloths, their bare skin glistening with sweat. It was clear that this planet, Ophiuchus IX, was vastly different from the sterile environments he was accustomed to on his space travels.

As he walked towards the air-conditioned building in the distance, Mayhem couldn't help but wonder why the Galactic League had chosen him for this mission. He couldn't recall any specific expertise he had in dealing with mystical civilizations or mental powers. Nevertheless, he had always been known as the Man Without a Body, his consciousness inhabiting an advanced robotic form. Perhaps his unique perspective on existence made him suitable for this investigation.

Inside the office, Mayhem was greeted by Kovandaswamy, the Galactic Observer assigned to Ophiuchus IX. Kovandaswamy was a reptilian being with iridescent scales, his body coiled around a chair that appeared too small for his size. As they exchanged greetings, Mayhem noticed the air in the office, free from the suffocating humidity outside. The relief was palpable, and it provided some respite from the uncomfortable environment he had just left.

Kovandaswamy began explaining the peculiar situation that had brought them to this forgotten world. Ophiuchus IX had long been a planet inhabited by a civilization deeply rooted in mysticism. They believed in the power of the mind, and their collective mental abilities were unlike anything the Galactic League had encountered before. These abilities, however, had taken a dark turn.

It seemed that the planet's inhabitants could influence the minds of outworlders, causing them to fall into deep despair and eventually commit suicide. Naturally, this raised alarms within the Galactic League, as it posed a threat not only to their members but also to the stability of the entire intergalactic community. Mayhem's task was to uncover the truth behind this phenomenon and find a way to neutralize or control it.

As Mayhem listened to Kovandaswamy's explanation, he couldn't help but feel a mix of curiosity and apprehension. The mysticism and mental powers exhibited by the inhabitants of Ophiuchus IX were beyond the realms of his understanding. He wondered how one could combat an enemy that attacked from within, using the very essence of the mind as a weapon.

Over the course of his investigation, Mayhem delved into the history and culture of the planet's inhabitants. He spent time with the local shamans, learning about their beliefs and rituals. He observed their mystical practices and witnessed the extent of their mental powers firsthand. It was evident that they had honed their abilities for centuries, using them for both good and ill.

As Mayhem delved deeper, he discovered that the planet's mysticism was intricately connected to the planet itself. Ophiuchus IX possessed a powerful energy source, a boundless well of mystical energy that permeated every living being on the planet. The inhabitants had learned to harness this energy and use it to shape their reality, including influencing the thoughts and emotions of others.

However, the misuse of this power had led to unintended consequences. The collective mental abilities of the inhabitants had become corrupted, turning from a force of enlightenment to one of destruction. The suicides were not intentional acts by the inhabitants themselves but rather a side effect of the immense psychic energy emanating from them.

Mayhem realized that the key to solving the crisis lay in restoring the balance of power on Ophiuchus IX. He began working closely with the local shamans to understand the intricacies of their mental powers. Together, they devised a plan to cleanse the planet's energy, to purify it from the negative influence that had tainted it.

Through a series of ceremonies and rituals, Mayhem and the shamans channeled their collective mental energies into the planet itself. They redirected the energy, purifying it and creating a barrier that prevented the negative influence from spreading. Slowly but surely, the suicides among outworlders ceased, and the planet began to heal.

Mayhem's investigation had not only uncovered the truth behind the mental powers on Ophiuchus IX but also had brought about a newfound understanding between the Galactic League and the planet's inhabitants. The experience had taught both sides the importance of balance and responsibility in wielding such immense powers.

As Mayhem bid farewell to Kovandaswamy and the people of Ophiuchus IX, he couldn't help but feel a sense of fulfillment. His journey had been one of exploration, not only of the physical universe but also of the depths of the human mind and the interplay between science and mysticism.

"Title: Using Apple's Backup Program without a .Mac Account: A Step-by-Step Guide

Introduction:
Apple's Backup program allows users to protect their important data by creating backups. Traditionally, it required a .Mac account, but in this guide, I will explain how to use Apple's Backup program without such an account. We'll set up a web server to mimic a .Mac account, which will enable you to utilize Apple's Backup program seamlessly. However, it's important to note the potential security concerns and limitations associated with this method.

Step 1: Choosing a Web Server Software
To begin, select a suitable web server software that will facilitate the process. Apache HTTP Server and Nginx are both popular choices. Ensure that the chosen software is compatible with your operating system.

Step 2: Install and Configure the Web Server
Follow the specific instructions for installing and configuring your chosen web server. Pay attention to the specific steps for your operating system. The software's documentation or online resources can guide you through this process.

Step 3: Creating a Virtual Host
To mimic a .Mac account, you need to create a virtual host on your web server. This virtual host will function as if it were a .Mac server. You can achieve this by adding a new configuration file to your web server's configuration directory.

Step 4: Configuring the Virtual Host
Open the virtual host configuration file and add the necessary directives. Ensure that you specify the domain name you wish to use. For example, if you want to use ""macbackup.com,"" specify it as the ServerName in your configuration file.

Step 5: Generate a Self-Signed SSL Certificate
To establish a secure connection between Apple's Backup program and your ""macbackup.com"" domain, a self-signed SSL certificate is required. Generate a self-signed SSL certificate using OpenSSL or other tools.

Step 6: Configure SSL for the Virtual Host
Modify the virtual host configuration file to include the SSL certificate and specify the required SSL parameters. Ensure that the SSLCertificateFile directive points to the location of your self-signed SSL certificate.

Step 7: Firewall and Router Configuration
Configure your firewall and router to allow incoming connections on the necessary ports (usually port 443 for SSL) to reach your web server. Consult your router's manual or online resources for guidance on port forwarding.

Step 8: DNS Settings and Domain Resolution
To ensure your computer recognizes the ""macbackup.com"" domain, you need to modify the DNS settings. Open the hosts file on your computer and add an entry for your domain, pointing it to your web server's IP address.

Step 9: Backup Program Configuration
Launch Apple's Backup program and navigate to the preferences or settings. Choose to use a remote server and specify the ""macbackup.com"" domain as the server address. Configure the necessary login credentials when prompted.

Step 10: Perform Backup Activities
With the configuration completed, you can now use Apple's Backup program as you would with a .Mac account. Set up the backup schedule, choose the data to be backed up, and configure any other settings according to your preferences.

Security Concerns and Limitations:
It is essential to consider the security concerns and limitations associated with this method:

1. Security Risks: Using a self-signed SSL certificate may provide a secure connection, but it will not be as secure as a certificate issued by a trusted certification authority. Exercise caution when transmitting sensitive data.

2. Lack of Official Support: This method goes against Apple's intended usage of the Backup program, and as such, you may encounter compatibility issues and lack of official support. Be prepared to troubleshoot on your own or seek help from online communities.

3. Reliability: Since you are relying on your own web server, the reliability and uptime may depend on your local network infrastructure and potential power outages. Ensure your network and server are stable to prevent interruptions in backup activities.

4. Maintenance and Updates: Regularly update your web server software, obtain and install security patches, and maintain good server management practices to keep your system secure and up-to-date.

Conclusion:
By following the step-by-step instructions outlined in this guide, you can successfully use Apple's Backup program without a .Mac account. However, be aware of the security risks and limitations involved. It is crucial to evaluate the trade-offs and consider alternative backup solutions if the security of your data is paramount.",1,0.0

"Main Course Dessert Drinks Genres Institutions Awards Theatre People The culture of Bangladesh is intertwined with the culture of the Bengal region of the Indian subcontinent. It has evolved over the centuries and encompasses the cultural diversity of several social groups of Bangladesh. The Bengal Renaissance of the 18th early 19th centuries, noted Bengali writers, saints, authors, scientists, researchers, thinkers, music composers, painters, film-makers have played a significant role in the development of Bengali culture. The Bengal Renaissance contained the seeds of a nascent political Indian nationalism which was the precursor in many ways to modern Indian artistic cultural expression. According to M. Nazrul Islam Tamij, a human rights activist and chairman of the National Human Rights Society (NHRS), human rights are the most important part of Bengali culture, and it plays an important role in the development of Bengali culture. The cultures of Bangladesh composite over the centuries have assimilated influences of Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Christianity. It is manifested in various forms, including music, dance, drama; art craft; folklore folktale; languages literature; philosophy religion; festivals celebrations; as well as in a distinct cuisine culinary tradition. The music dance styles of Bangladesh may be divided into three categories: classical, folk, modern. Bangladesh was once part of Pakistan. It was called East Pakistan. The classical style has been influenced by other prevalent classical forms of music dances of the Indian subcontinent, accordingly, show some influenced dance forms like Bharatnatyam Kathak. Several dancing styles in vogue are practised in the northeastern part of the Indian subcontinent, like Manipuri Santhali dances, but Bangladesh has developed its own distinct dancing styles. Bangladesh has a rich tradition of folk songs, with lyrics rooted in vibrant tradition spirituality, mysticism, devotion. Such folk songs revolve around other themes, including love. The most prevalent folk songs music traditions include Bhatiali, Baul, Marfati, Murshidi, Bhawaiya. Lyricists like Lalon Shah, Hason Raja, Kangal Harinath, Romesh Shill, Abbas Uddin, many unknown anonymous lyricists have enriched the tradition of folk songs of Bangladesh. In a relatively modern context, works of Rabindranath Tagore and Nazrul Islam form a major part of the cultural heritage of Bangladesh. Several musical instruments, some of them indigenous, are used in Bangladesh. Major musical instruments used are the bamboo flute (Bashi), drums (tabla, dhol), a single-stringed instrument named ektara, a four-stringed instrument called dotara, a pair of metal bowls, used for rhythm effects, called mandira. Currently, musical instruments of western origin, like guitars, drums, and the saxophone are used, sometimes along with traditional instruments (Muajj). From the 90's, It gave rise to quality rock bands, not only the urban place from Dhaka but also the port city Chittagong. The Bangladeshi press is diverse, outspoken and privately owned. Over 200 newspapers are published in the country. Bangladesh Betar is the state-run radio service.[1] The British Broadcasting Corporation operates the popular BBC Bangla news and current affairs service. Bengali broadcasts from Voice of America are also very popular. Bangladesh Television (BTV) is the state-owned television network. There are more than 20 privately owned television networks, including several news channels. Freedom of the media remains a major concern, due to government attempts at censorship and harassment of journalists. The cinema of Bangladesh dates back to 1898 when films began screening at the Crown Theatre in Dhaka. The first bioscope in the subcontinent was established in Dhaka that year. The Dhaka Nawab Family patronized the production of several silent films in the 1920s and 30s. In 1931, the East Bengal Cinematograph Society released the first full-length feature film in Bangladesh, titled the Last Kiss. The first feature film in East Pakistan, Mukh O Mukhosh, was released in 1956. During the 1960s, 25–30 films were produced annually in Dhaka. By the 2000s, Bangladesh produced 80–100 films a year. While the Bangladeshi film industry has achieved limited commercial success; the country has produced notable independent film makers. Zahir Raihan was a prominent documentary-maker who was assassinated in 1971. The late Tareque Masud is regarded as one of Bangladesh's outstanding directors due to his numerous productions on historical and social issues. Masud was honored by FIPRESCI at the Cannes Film Festival in 2002 for his film The Clay Bird. Tanvir Mokammel, Mostofa Sarwar Farooki, Humayun Ahmed, Alamgir Kabir, Subhash Dutta and Chashi Nazrul Islam are other prominent directors of Bangladesh cinema. Festivals and celebrations are an integral part of the culture of Bangladesh. Pohela Falgun, Pohela Boishakh for Bengali and Boishabi for hill tracks tribal, Matribhasha dibosh, victory day, Nobanno, Pitha Utshob in winter, Poush Songkranti and chaitro sankranti in the last day of Bangla month chaitro, Shakhrain are celebrated by everyone despite their religion. Muslim festivals of Eid ul-Fitr, Eid ul-Adha, Milad un Nabi, Muharram, Chand raat, Shab-e-Barat, Bishwa Ijtema; Hindu festivals of Durga Puja and Janmashtami; Buddhist festival of Buddha Purnima; Christian festival of Christmas and secular festivals like Pohela Boishakh, Nabanna, Language Movement Day, Independence Day, Rabindra Jayanti, Nazrul Jayanti witness widespread celebrations and usually are national holidays in Bangladesh. As the most important religious festival for the majority of Muslims, the celebration of Eid ul-Fitr has become a part of the culture of Bangladesh. The government of Bangladesh declares the holiday for three days on Eid-ul Fitr. But practically, all schools, colleges, and offices remain closed for a week. This is the happiest time of the year for most of the people in Bangladesh. All outgoing public transport from the major cities become highly crowded and in many cases the fares tend to rise in spite of government restrictions. On Eid day, the Eid prayers are held all over the country, in open areas like fields, Eidgahs or inside mosques.[2] After the Eid prayers, people return home, visit each other's home and eat sweet dishes called Shirini, Sheer Khurma and other delicacies like biryani, korma, haleem, kebab etc. Throughout the day people embrace each other and exchange greetings.

"""What? Where? When?"" (Russian: Что? Где? Когда?, translit. Chto? Gde? Kogda?), commonly known as ChGK, is an intellectual game show that originated in the former Soviet Union and remains immensely popular in Russia and other CIS states. The show combines elements of trivia, puzzle-solving, and critical thinking to test the knowledge and analytical skills of its participants.

The history of ChGK dates back to 1975, when it first aired on the Soviet TV channel, the All-Union Program ""Horizontal"". The game quickly gained a devoted following, and over the years, it has evolved and adapted to the changing times. Today, ChGK is broadcast on Russian television and has become a cultural phenomenon, with thousands of loyal viewers and an active online community.

The format of ChGK revolves around a panel of experts, known as ""wizards,"" who compete against each other to answer questions posed by the show's host and submitted by viewers. The questions cover a wide range of topics, including history, science, literature, arts, sports, and general knowledge. The complexity level of the questions varies, challenging the participants' depth of knowledge and ability to connect seemingly unrelated facts.

The game proceeds in rounds, with each team (consisting of up to six players) having a set amount of time to discuss and provide an answer to the posed question. The teams can consult with their captain, who usually possesses a higher level of expertise. Once the time is up, the team must present their answer, which is then evaluated by the wizards. The wizards award points based on the validity and accuracy of the response.

One of the distinctive features of ChGK is the absence of instant rewards for correct answers. Instead, participants accumulate points throughout the game, and the winning team is determined by the total number of points earned at the end. This unique approach ensures that contestants focus on strategizing and analyzing each question thoroughly, enhancing the competitive nature of the game.

Apart from the televised version of ChGK in Russia, the game has also gained popularity internationally. The competitive variant of the game, known as the World Championships of ""What? Where? When?"" (WWWC), is played in multiple countries across the globe. Teams from different nations participate in this annual event, showcasing their intellectual prowess and cultural diversity.

The WWWC follows a similar format to its Russian counterpart, including the use of expert panels and the posing of challenging questions. The competition consists of several rounds, and the team accumulating the highest number of points emerges as the world champion. The event not only fosters international collaboration and camaraderie among intellectual game enthusiasts but also helps promote cultural exchange and understanding.

The popularity of ChGK and its international championship stems from its ability to engage and entertain both participants and viewers. The game demands an exceptional depth of knowledge, as well as quick thinking and logical reasoning skills. It provides a platform for individuals to showcase their intellect and passion for learning while offering an entertaining and engaging experience for the audience.

In conclusion, ""What? Where? When?"" (Chto? Gde? Kogda?) is a highly popular intellectual game show that originated in the former Soviet Union and has since gained a dedicated following in Russia and other CIS states. The format of the game combines trivia, puzzle-solving, and critical thinking, challenging participants' knowledge and analytical abilities. The success of ChGK has led to the establishment of an international championship, further promoting intellectual competition and cultural exchange.",1,0.0
"I remember my time at St. Augustine's Private School like it was yesterday. Those were the days of youthful curiosity and innocent mischief. But amidst the laughter and lessons, there was always an undercurrent of thrilling fear, fueled by the ghost stories that circulated among us students. As I think back on those tales, I can't help but wonder if they still find their way into young imaginations today.

One of the most popular ghost stories that sent shivers down our spines was that of the Headless Haunter. Legend had it that a former headmaster of the school had tragically lost his head in a gruesome accident. The headmaster's ghost was said to wander the halls at night, searching for his lost cranium. According to the story, the Headless Haunter would appear to unsuspecting students and demand that they help him find his missing head. If they refused, he would haunt them until they did.

Another eerie tale that chilled us to the bone was the story of the Crying Girl. It was said that a young girl, a former student of the school, had died under mysterious circumstances decades ago. Her spirit was rumored to haunt the dormitory where she once lived. Students claimed to hear her sobbing in the dead of night, sometimes accompanied by the sound of her footsteps running down the corridor. Some even claimed to have seen her shadowy figure standing at the end of their beds, tears streaming down her ethereal face.

But the most spine-chilling of all the ghost stories was the legend of the Bell Tower Ghost. The bell tower, standing tall and majestic, had always been an iconic symbol of our school. The story went that a student had fallen to their death from the tower many years ago. Their spirit was said to roam the tower, forever trapped in a state of sorrow and regret. Students whispered that they could hear the ghostly cries echoing through the tower, and some even swore they had seen a pale figure pacing back and forth on the narrow ledge.

While these ghost stories were enough to make our hearts race with fear, there was one particular incident during my time at St. Augustine's that added a touch of intrigue to the folklore. A new teacher had arrived at the beginning of the school year, Mr. Hawthorne. There was an air of mystery surrounding him. He was always impeccably dressed and had an old-fashioned charm about him. But it was the charm on his watch-chain that made everyone curious. It was an intricately designed silver pendant in the shape of a key. Rumors quickly spread that the key charm had some connection to the school's ghost stories.

The students speculated that he might have some knowledge about the haunted tales and perhaps even a personal experience. We would often catch glimpses of him staring up at the bell tower, lost in thought. Some bold individuals even attempted to engage him in conversation about the legends, but he would always give a cryptic smile and change the subject.

As the years have passed, I find myself wondering if the same ghost stories continue to captivate the students of St. Augustine's. Have new legends sprung up, intertwining with the old ones? Does the Headless Haunter still roam the halls, searching for his lost head? Is the Crying Girl's ghost still heard in the dead of night? Does the Bell Tower Ghost continue to haunt the tower, its mournful cries echoing through the years?

And what became of Mr. Hawthorne, the mysterious teacher with the key charm on his watch-chain? Did he possess a secret connection to the stories, or was he merely an enigmatic figure that added to the mystique of our private school? I suppose I will never know for certain, but the memories of those ghost stories at St. Augustine's will forever stay with me, as I imagine they do for the students who follow in our footsteps.",1,0.0
"I don't know who Allen Jacobs is, but it would be much appreciated if he were to stop using my e-mail address when signing on-line petitions. You see, just the other day I noticed something distinctly odd amongst the penis enlargement and home loan advertisements in my E-mail folder. There was a message entitled, ""petition signature confirmed - I'm With Busey"". This sent up a red flag in my head. Are they talking, I thought to myself, about that stupid reality show with Gary Busey and that guy who claimed to be a comedy writer even though he showed no sign of a working sense of humor? And, by the way, I have no idea why I use the 'they' pronoun, I guess I like to think of a vast underground network of people filling my inbox, instead of single, solitary nerds. Anyway, with my curiosity sufficiently piqued I opened the e-mail, and to my abject horror discovered that someone, this so-called 'Allen Jacobs', has signed, using my e-mail address, a petition to bring back the show 'I'm With Busey'. I was truly horrified. Trust me if 'I'm With Busey' makes it back on the air, I had nothing to do with it. I'm absolving myself of all guilt right now. It was all a horrible, horrible mistake. Whoever this Allen Jacobs is must have mistyped his e-mail address and come up with mine. Please, you have to believe me. I don't want 'I'm With Busey' back on the air. I would never knowing aid in unleashing such a devastating evil onto the world. I mean, this blog is bad enough, but, then again, I'm pretty much convinced no one reads this, so there's no harm here. Eventually, after much renting of clothes and gnashing of teeth, I calmed down and became quite curious. What is this petition? Where'd it come from? Are people actually signing this thing? Shouldn't Gary Busey be dead by now anyway? So, I read the entire e-mail message and found that the petition - and the e-mail - originated from PetitionOnline.com. So went to the sight and found the Busey petition. Apparently 'I'm With Busey' has - had? - fans, and they cannot imagine why this ""innovative and creative"" show would be canceled by Comedy Central ""without any given reason."" Apparently, these people are unfamiliar with a little thing I like to call the Nielson television ratings. Sufficiently satisfied the 'I'm with Busey' petition was mostly harmless, I decided to explore the site a little fuller. Let me tell you, a whole world opened up before my eyes. A world populated by obsessive dorks and losers with too much time on their hands and internet access. I felt right at home. People have petitions for everything. Some of them even made bringing back 'I'm with Busey' seem like a good idea. Why would anyone in his right mind sign a petition to keep 'On Air with Ryan Seacrest' true to its name? And that's not a rhetorical question. I really want to know. If you can fill me in, please do. There are a lot of odd petitions. Most of them having to do with bringing back canceled shows on sci-fi and stuff having to do with video games - which gives you a pretty good idea who the average users are. Mixed in amongst these typical internet type concerns where things such as a petition to prove that someone's ex boyfriend is a real 'Dick Eating Dick Face' and someone who desperately wants to see Bob's Big Boy make a comeback in the worse possible way - although, I'm pretty sure, Big Boy can't come back any other way. There was one really quaint petition entitled 'Stop the Hate' which was obviously posted by some well meaning, but utterly clueless liberal teenager. This ranks right up there with putting those stickers that say 'hating' at the bottom of stop signs. Sure, it's a swell message and all, but it doesn't really do anything but help the person who put it up feel good about himself. It's not as though a Klansman is going drive by one of those stop signs or see a petition against hate and all of a sudden clap his palm to his forehead exclaiming, ""Stop hating, why didn't I think of that"" - but then again I didn't actually look at the petition, just the name, it could be quite different from what I expect. Now, here's the part which really got me thinking. PetitionOnline.com bills itself as 'a premiere free speech forum.' While I agree that free speech is one of the most important rights reserved for us in the constitution, and that this site is certainly a forum for free speech, I would be a little wary about calling it premiere. Now, maybe the PetitionOnline creators started with noble causes, to, say, petition the government - which is expressly protected by the 1st amendment - but when the founding fathers added the first amendment I'm sure creating a petition to get a lame TV show back on the air wasn't high on their minds. I'm not saying that they'd be against it, but if they knew that people where using free speech to save 'I'm with Busey', they would most likely answer with a yawn - of course you'd first have to explain television to them and then give them some sort of idea what Gary Busey's like and then describe the show to them. ""By Gum,"" they may say, ""Sure we fought for freedom of speech, and your silly little petitions are cute and all, but doesn't anyone have anything real to say? Aggrievments to the government perhaps?"" People fought and died for serious issues, not so some moron could sign a petition as 'BUTTSEX' - the same person listed his location as 'BUTTSEX' and left, as a comment, 'No, seriously, I like BUTTSEX'. It just seems that people use the term freedom of speech too loosely",0,0.0
"them critically, but made no effort to come closer. ""If we're late for ship's landing, Joe, we'll get crossed off the list."" Hill puffed and wheezed and took another hitch on the rope. ""That's what I've been thinking about,"" he said, worried. They took a deep breath and hauled mightily on the raft rope. The raft bobbed nearer. For a moment the swift waters of the Karazoo threatened to tear it out of their grasp, and then it was beached, most of it solidly, on the muddy bank. One end of it still lay in the gurgling, rushing waters, but that didn't matter. They'd be back in ten hours or so, long before the heavy raft could be washed free. ""How much time have we got, Karl?"" The ground was thick with shadows, and Karl cast a critical eye at them. He estimated that even with the refusal of their yllumphs to help beach the raft, they still had a good two hours before the rocket put down at Landing City. ""Two hours, maybe a little more,"" he stated hastily when Hill looked more worried. ""Time enough to get to Landing City and put in for our numbers on the list."" He turned back to the raft, untied the leather and horn saddles, and threw them over the backs of their reluctant mounts. He cinched his saddle and tied on some robes and furs behind it. Hill watched him curiously. ""What are you taking the furs for? This isn't the trading rocket."" ""I know. I thought that when we come back tonight, it might be cold and maybe _she'll_ appreciate the coverings then."" ""You never would have thought of it yourself,"" Hill grunted. ""Grundy must have told you to do it, the old fool. If you ask me, the less you give them, the less they'll come to expect. Once you spoil them, they'll expect you to do all the trapping and the farming and the family-raising yourself."" ""You didn't have to sign up,"" Karl pointed out. ""You could have applied for a wife from some different planet."" ""One's probably just as good as another. They'll all have to work the farms and raise families."" Karl laughed and aimed a friendly blow at Hill. They finished saddling up and headed into the thick forest. * * * * * It was quiet as Karl guided his mount along the dimly marked trail and he caught himself thinking of the return trip he would be making that night. It would be nice to have somebody new to talk to. And it would be good to have somebody to help with the trapping and tanning, somebody who could tend the small vegetable garden at the rear of his shack and mend his socks and wash his clothes and cook his meals. And it was time, he thought soberly, that he started to raise a family. He was mid-twenty now, old enough to want a wife and children. ""You going to raise a litter, Joe?"" Hill started. Karl realized that he had probably been thinking of the same thing. ""One of these days I'll need help around the sawmill,"" Hill answered defensively. ""Need some kids to cut the trees, a couple more to pole them down the river, some to run the mill itself and maybe one to sell the lumber in Landing City. Can't do it all myself."" He paused a moment, thinking over something that had just occurred to him. ""I've been thinking of your plans for a garden, Karl. Maybe I ought to have one for my wife to take care of, too."" Karl chuckled. ""I don't think she'll have the time!"" They left the leafy expanse of the forest and entered the grasslands that sloped toward Landing City. He could even see Landing City itself on the horizon, a smudge of rusting, corrugated steel shacks, muddy streets, and the small rocket port--a scorched thirty acres or so fenced off with barbed wire. Karl looked out of the corner of his eye at Hill and felt a vague wave of uneasiness. Hill was a big, thick man wearing the soiled clothes and bristly stubble of a man who was used to living alone and who liked it. But once he took a wife, he would probably have to keep himself in clean clothes and shave every few days. It was even possible that the woman might object to Hill letting his yllumph share the hut. The path was getting crowded, more of the colonists coming onto the main path from the small side trails. Hill broke the silence first. ""I wonder what they'll be like."" Karl looked wise and nodded knowingly. ""They're Earthwomen, Joe. _Earth!_"" It was easy to act as though he had some inside information, but Karl had to admit to himself that he actually knew very little about it. He was a Second System colonist and had never even seen an Earthwoman. He had heard tales, though, and even discounting a large percentage of them, some of them must have been true. Old Grundy at the rocket office, who should know about these things if anybody did, seemed disturbingly lacking on definite information, though he had hinted broadly enough. He'd whistle softly and wink an eye and repeat the stories that Karl had already heard; but he had nothing _definite_ to offer, no real facts at all. Some of the other colonists whom they hadn't seen for the last few months shouted greetings, and Karl began to feel some of the carnival spirit. There was Jenkins, who had another trapping line fifty miles farther up the Karazoo; Leonard, who had the biggest farm on Midplanet; and then the fellow who specialized in catching and breaking in yllumphs, whose name Karl couldn't remember. ""They say they're good workers,"" Hill said. Karl nodded. ""Pretty, too."" They threaded their way through the crowded and muddy streets. Landing City wasn't big, compared to some of the cities on Altair, where he",0,0.0

His manners were courteous, and he loved nothing better than singing and playing. He used to associate with actors, and with an embroidered handkerchief round his head the effect was that of a beautiful woman. Hence he acquired the sobriquet of the Beauty. At fourteen years of age he graduated and began to make a name for himself; but his father, who was growing old and wished to retire from business, said to him, “My boy, book-learning will never fill your belly or put a coat on your back; you had much better stick to the old thing.” Accordingly, Ma from that time occupied himself with scales and weights, with principle and interest, and such matters. He made a voyage across the sea, and was carried away by a typhoon. After being tossed about for many days and nights he arrived at a country where the people were hideously ugly. When these people saw Ma they thought he was a devil and all ran screeching away. Ma was somewhat alarmed at this, but finding that it was they who were frightened at",0,0.0

"In the quiet town of Hadleyburg, known throughout the land for its impeccable honesty and unyielding integrity, a dark cloud began to cast its shadow. Unknown to the town's residents, a stranger had arrived with a sinister motive in mind. Driven by a seething desire for revenge, this stranger sought to corrupt the very fabric of Hadleyburg's tight-knit community.

The stranger, shrouded in mystery with an air of malevolence surrounding him, set his plan into motion. He knew that the residents of Hadleyburg held their reputation dear, priding themselves on their unblemished record of honesty. He understood that by exploiting this weakness, he could strike a blow that would reverberate through the town's soul.

The seed of his scheme lay in a past incident, a slight suffered by the stranger at the hands of the town. It was an injustice that had festered in his heart, slowly consuming his every thought until it manifested as an insidious desire for retaliation. And thus, with a meticulous eye for detail, he embarked on a mission to sow the seeds of corruption in Hadleyburg.

The stranger began by studying the town's residents, meticulously observing their daily lives and interactions. He sought out individuals who he believed could be easily swayed, those whose integrity was not as unshakable as the town's reputation would suggest. With a keen eye for weakness, he targeted those who possessed hidden desires or secrets they wished to conceal.

One by one, the stranger approached these unsuspecting individuals, subtly introducing temptation into their lives. To some, he offered the allure of wealth, promising that their deepest desires would be fulfilled if they followed his lead. To others, he appealed to their pride, exploiting their need for recognition and adulation. And to those burdened by guilt, he artfully promised redemption and absolution.

The stranger's methods were cunning. He manipulated circumstances, creating situations where individuals were forced to confront their inner vulnerabilities. He played on their fears and insecurities, offering them the chance to escape the shackles of their own consciences. And as each person succumbed to the temptation, the stranger reveled in his growing power over the once unbreakable moral fiber of Hadleyburg.

Word of these sinister dealings began to spread through the town, like whispers carried on the wind. Some residents grew suspicious, sensing the nefarious presence that had infiltrated their tranquil community. But others, consumed by their own desires, willingly succumbed to the stranger's machinations, falling deeper into the abyss of corruption.

As the stranger's influence expanded, the repercussions of his actions rippled through the fabric of Hadleyburg. Trust among friends and neighbors was shattered, replaced by doubt and suspicion. The once harmonious community became divided, with accusations and resentment tearing at its very core. The stranger's revenge was taking its toll, leaving a scar that would forever mar the town's reputation.

But Hadleyburg, though wounded, would not be defeated so easily. In the face of adversity, some began to question the path they had taken, realizing the consequences of their actions. They saw the poison that had seeped into their souls and yearned for redemption. With a newfound determination, they sought to undo the damage they had wrought and restore the town's honor.

Thus, the battle against corruption began. The citizens of Hadleyburg, once blinded by their own weaknesses, rallied together to fight against the stranger's influence. They rekindled the flame of integrity that had defined their town for generations, vowing to rebuild what had been lost.

And in a final act of defiance, the people of Hadleyburg turned the tables on their tormentor. They exposed the stranger's true intentions and unveiled his web of deceit, bringing him to justice. The town, scarred but wiser, emerged from the ordeal stronger than before.

In the end, the stranger's quest for revenge had only served to reinforce the very values he sought to destroy. Hadleyburg, once shaken to its core, rose from the ashes like a phoenix, reminding the world of the enduring power of honesty and the indomitable spirit of a community united against corruption.",1,0.0
"So, let me give you the lowdown on the workplace dynamics and decision-making process that's been going on at my office. It's like being in the middle of a reality TV show, I swear. Okay, maybe not that dramatic, but definitely interesting.

Here's the scoop. There's this new position opening up, and two of my colleagues, let's call them Tim and Sarah, are both gunning for it. Now, let me tell you, these two have been at each other's throats from day one. It's like a tennis match of passive-aggressive comments and undermining tactics. It's actually quite entertaining to watch, as long as you're not directly involved.

The decision-making process for this new position has been dragging on for what feels like forever. First, there were the initial interviews, where Tim and Sarah both knocked it out of the park. Both of them are super talented and have impressive resumes, so it's really a tough choice for the higher-ups. And of course, they had to make it even harder by having a second round of interviews. Come on, guys, make a decision already!

As an observer, I've had a front-row seat to all the drama. It's like being in a never-ending episode of ""Survivor."" You've got Tim, who's all about playing mind games. He's constantly dropping hints about his own achievements and trying to make Sarah doubt herself. Then, you've got Sarah, who's more of a straight shooter. She focuses on her own accomplishments and tries to maintain a professional demeanor. It's like watching a master manipulator battle against a no-nonsense competitor.

Meanwhile, the rest of us are just caught in the middle, trying not to get caught in the crossfire. I'll be honest, it's a bit exhausting. You never know who's going to come into work with a smile or a scowl. One day, Tim will act all buddy-buddy and offer to grab lunch with you, only to subtly pry for information about Sarah. The next day, Sarah will be all chatty and gossipy, hoping you'll spill the beans about Tim's weaknesses. It's like being caught in a whirlwind of office politics.

And then there's me, stuck in the middle of it all. Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining. In fact, I kind of relish the chaos. It's like a puzzle to solve, trying to decipher the motivations and actions of my colleagues. Plus, it's a great opportunity to practice my own decision-making skills. If I were in the position of the higher-ups, who would I choose? Tim or Sarah? It's a tough call, and I'm glad I'm not the one making it.

But amidst all the chaos, I can't help but wonder about my own career aspirations. On one hand, I'm entertained by all this drama, but on the other hand, it makes me question my own path. Am I on the right track? Should I be more aggressive and assertive like Tim? Or should I be focused and professional like Sarah? It's a bit of an identity crisis, to be honest.

At the end of the day, though, I try not to let all this drama consume me. Yes, workplace dynamics and decision-making processes can be a rollercoaster, but I've learned to take it in stride. I do my best to stay true to myself, be supportive to both Tim and Sarah, and focus on my own growth and development. After all, I can't control what happens between them, but I can control my own actions and attitude.

So, here's to navigating the crazy world of office politics and decision-making processes. May we all find our own path, make the best choices, and maybe even have a little fun along the way. Cheers!",1,
"My day was flawless. The weather was absolutely corking today, breezy with this penetrating sunshine that subtly caught me between gusts of wind and billowing clouds. I'm listening to Debussy's “Beau Soir”, and I'm lost in ecstasy. And yet I claim to be completely rid of sentimentality. Get away, you pesky beast of denial! Shoo! I'm thinking of cutting my hair. Elisse cut hers today, it's all sexy and tousled and short. Mine's almost down to my waist, and it's hard only having two looks to work with- up and down. Really kind of frustrating. Anyway- the bat left this week for Colorado. Apparently she's going to see her friend Betty who broke her hip, had two heart attacks, and gained 80 pounds all in the same month. Yeah- she's not alone in being completely and totally weird. The word ""weird"" is probably one of the weakest adjectives in the English language, but I simply cannot fight the fact that it is the most appropriate. She’s amusing yet depressing, alive with senile vivacity yet so withered; she leaves one in a neutral mindset that can’t be described. The woman is simply weird. I’ve discovered another person I’ve decided to add to my hate list. Here is my new updated version: 1. Boris the Dog 2. That freaking 6’2’’ goddess that stalks the B floor. No one has the right to look like that. No one. I hate people who are prettier than me with an ardent passion that I don’t endeavor to curtail. Grrrrr 3. The Bat- the more I think about her, the more disgusted I am. 4. Amy Jo- sorry, love. Stupid people and I just don’t mix well. What can I say? I think I’ll allow JD Bernal to say it for me: “The full area of ignorance is not mapped. We are at present only exploring the fringes.” 5. John Galliano, for doing what he does to Dior every other show. 6. Tom Ford, for what he’s doing to Gucci by leaving. 7. That stupid little girl that stares at me and sits in front of me at church. Why are those overly-large pale blue eyes always staring at me from two pews away? Why? For two freaking years she stares at me for the majority of sacrament. May you have glass legs and may the glass break, you yellow bellied comatose prant! 8. And the newest addition to my list: Heather McGuire. This girl was born of the lowest realms of mediocrity, yet raised and parented by arrogance and haughtiness themselves. She’s the type of creature to label an entry as her favorite, best written blog entry, and then proceed to show you the most vile of expressions and manifestations; a smoldering lump of goopy sentiment and cliché nonsensical avowals. I don’t mean to be rude, but you simply must view this: “This eye followed me from childhood on up until this past week or so. Clearing my mind of childish disasters and broadening my feel for future life took its creepy toll just these past months. In its bittersweet victory my maturation both mind and spirit kicked me in the teeth and hanged me by the fireside. Honesty towards all others including myself became so palapable in my new reality. The clairvoyant mysteries of my family drenched me with harsh passion against anyone who dare discover the secret. In my mind I always knew my family was unhappy, yet we put on this show with great eloquence; one in which the carnival ride ceases to halt in its spinning and whirling. Like the titanic struck by an iceberg in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean and still remaining ""unsinkable"", I so blatantly saw what came from beneath me. The boring reality of my new found maturity grasped me with both hands and dunked me under its tide for minutes that seemed like hours those which will now drag on for years at a time not without occassional moments of immature glory. In several hopeless attempts to save what has been done, I myself die with the inheritence. Simple questions with complex answers pressure me to grow up faster than I have to. It makes me sad to think that I'll be stuck in this rut forever unless I change my whole ideas about going through life, and as long as I keep myself busy. I'm not sad anymore, I'm not happy anymore, I'm not hurt anymore, I'm not fulfilled anymore. I'm just curiously bored out of my mind. In another hopeless attempt, I think all I need is affection without a schedule, and a new job to work on my weeknights. Side Note: Sorry if you cannot understand my random mumblings, maybe someone someday will. I don't purposefully try to sound like a ""yale scholar"" even though my confusing thoughts may lead some to believe this and the fact that I used 2 or 3 of my English vocabulary words in this entry. (I'm proud of myself sometimes, but some people succeed in tearing down my walls and poking my feelings, so I become bitter and use it against them for a few months, then I give up because that too gets boring.) My best thoughts know no boundaries and usually only make sense to me and to those with great ability to analyze. On an ending note -- Ever since I cleaned my room it's been cold in here; I should have left all the junk in here, at least it kept it warm. From my brain to yours, do with it what you wish -Stupid.” These vocabulary words are so obviously planted that the fact that she misspelled one of them is demoralizing. I suppose I am moved emotionally in a very distressing way, perhaps she felt this too, hence the feeling of prided she late expressed at writing such rubbish: “I feel confident that I'm going to be a future achiever of America. I can handle the pressure, can you? I",0,
"I was able to talk to my chat this morning. But alas... it all had to end. Thinking Long time I went to Echelon Mall where i spent $7 on a cold cut sandwich which wasnt as good as the ones i order in WaWa but ok enough. I should have asked for more spicy mustard, horse radish. Well i got to drawing. Starting with excersizes drawing people who passed by. Drawing their faces as well as i could with just a glance and their bodies. In a country with so much obese people a person from a 3rd world country like me would get an impression that there are alot of gluttons out there. Who am i to judge, when media here and sewsawing moral and ethical attitudes drive people to find some source of comfort and take it in heavily... be it eating, sex, hobbies or just plain old money. Like my experiences in UP. What i see when i look around is the extreems people can be. While back home it more of the extreems of poverty. Despite this footnote it wasn't this that occupied my mind most of that afternoon. There was the problem with the job again. With no experience working blue colar and with white colar jobs knowledge being limited and that I really think it will be a long and jobless 5 months. My only salvation is the new computer and old training programs of my old school skills. If tonton can get me those disks we were talking about i can practice and build a resume. In 5 months i can do something. And if no-one bothers me it can be a lot. Training Jasper Well those programs can be put to good use with jasper. I mean jasper suffering jobless ness and a life he may not further enjoy to the fullest what better way to turn the balance if i teach him 3d graphics... Not that i am an expert but its just i know the basics and i know where to find what he needs to know. Self Training Teaching my self to draw again and draw fast is hard but i think i can relearn what i lost in the past years i stopped drawing. I guess thats the problem with MMA i didnt have time to draw. What is an arts course if i stopped drawing. I guess if i had the means I would not need a college degree. I know what i needed to finish. Its a magna opus. One great work to base my port folio in. Gino gave me the means already and with some time i can finish the pages i need. I have it all... Its just that i don't have a place to work. I can't work at christine's nor can i work at south jersey where there is no space for me. I would have to stay in the new house at jersey city. I would have to work quietly in the basement where me and jasper can sit down in a small cramped table and work. I hope i get ton2 package in time. Heck if i can teach jasper to be an artist that would be cool. Jasper is hard working and thats most of being an artist, there is also honest appraisal. Hearing what you don't want to hear but what you need to hear. Current conditions Its cramped here at jobert room. I can't draw given the heat of the day. I bet it would be much worse in winter. I guess i have to gain weight. But with no place to burn and build muscles i guess the north is the only place i have to be. Its ok if i don't see job or jas (if they stay south). I need to do this and I don't have much of a choice. Living and working without them had been something i got used to and lived by back at the philippines when they both went ahead of me to the states. I just hope no body bothers me... christine the devil i'm sure will try to ruin me though. Christine the Devil My oldersister is a total hoar. Selling her soul to the highest bidder and being such a hippocrite she uses people with no remores. She implacted me and my siblings as lazy and worthless to gain favor with my parents . Favor i care nothing for but causes my parents to use us unfairly, thus she controls us indircetly through my parents. She would say: ""i'm such a neat freak and you guys are making me stressed out"" counter clue - 1 her car is such a mess there is no room to sit except for the driver. How can she mean that. - her place when we first arrived WAS discheveled, there was no real evidence that she was tidy. Motive she wants us to stay as her free personal maids. Made evident by her moves towards our mother, her pitty tactics, flattery, and her evident ""use"" of us to clean up after HER mess when she is entertaining guests. My evil sister... the girl who used to steal from mom (and mom forgot all about it). Who never got punished and the REAL total drop out. Her plan Once we move she will take the garage... which is half of the first floor (basement like conditions)... the space relegated to me and jasper. Unfortunately... I will be still her maid. I wont clean up after that irresponsible, cock sucking, ass fucked, hoar. She will use pitty tactics and all to get us to do stuff for her. let all the guys she asks favors for fuck her.

"So, let me tell you about this wild night I had last weekend. It was a Friday night, and I was going out with my friends for some much-needed fun and relaxation. We decided to hit up this new club in town that everyone had been raving about.

We arrived at the club around 10 pm, and it was already packed with people. The music was blasting, and the energy in the air was palpable. We made our way to the bar and ordered a round of shots to kick off the night.

As the night went on, the drinks kept flowing, and I started feeling pretty buzzed. I was dancing like there was no tomorrow, completely lost in the music and the atmosphere. The DJ was killing it, playing all my favorite songs.

At some point, I noticed this attractive person making eye contact with me from across the room. They had this mysterious, sexy vibe about them that intrigued me. I decided to take a chance and make my way over to strike up a conversation.

We hit it off instantly. We talked about everything from our favorite music to our wildest adventures. The chemistry was undeniable, and before I knew it, we were making out on the dance floor like a couple of horny teenagers.

Things escalated quickly from there. We found a quieter corner of the club and started getting hot and heavy. Let's just say there were no inhibitions that night. We were wrapped up in our own little world, oblivious to the chaos happening around us.

Eventually, we decided to take things back to their place. We stumbled out of the club, barely able to walk straight. I'm pretty sure we even tripped a couple of times along the way, but it only added to the excitement.

Once we got to their apartment, it was like a scene out of a porno. We tore each other's clothes off, exploring each other's bodies with a passion that was almost animalistic. It was an intense, mind-blowing experience that left me breathless and wanting more.

The next morning, I woke up in a haze, my head pounding with a hangover. As I lay there, I couldn't help but reflect on the events of the previous night. It was a whirlwind, and part of me couldn't believe that it had actually happened.

But you know what? Despite the alcohol-induced fog, I realized that I had no regrets. It was a night of pure fun and pleasure, a wild adventure that I'll always remember. It was a reminder that sometimes it's okay to let loose and indulge in our primal desires.

Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not advocating for reckless behavior or encouraging one-night stands. Personal experiences like this can be exhilarating, but they also come with risks. It's essential to prioritize consent, safety, and respect in all our interactions.

So, that's the story of my wild night out. It was a crazy, unforgettable experience that I'll cherish forever. Life is full of unexpected moments, and sometimes you just have to go with the flow and embrace the excitement. Who knows what other thrilling adventures are waiting for me in the future?",1,
"As someone who has always been fascinated by the concept of time travel, I couldn't resist engaging in a debate with my old physics professor, Haskel van Manderpootz. You see, I had a reputation for being consistently late, and it was a running joke that I was just trying to find a way to travel through time to make it on time for appointments. Haskel, with his eccentric personality and arrogant demeanor, was the perfect person to have a discussion on the topic.

One day, after class, I decided to approach him and ask, ""Professor van Manderpootz, do you believe that time travel is possible?""

Haskel looked at me, his eyes gleaming with excitement. ""Ah, time travel! A fascinating subject indeed,"" he replied, a hint of smugness in his tone. ""My dear student, not only do I believe it is possible, but I have, in fact, conducted an experiment on time travel myself.""

My interest was piqued, and I eagerly pressed him for details. ""You conducted an experiment on time travel? Please, tell me more!""

Haskel cleared his throat and began to explain his experiment. He described constructing a complex device using superconducting magnets, lasers, and a series of precisely calibrated atomic clocks. He claimed that by manipulating the rotation of the Earth's gravitational field relative to the device, he was able to create a localized field that caused time to dilate within its confines.

According to Haskel, he had successfully demonstrated the effects of time dilation by measuring the difference in time experienced by two atomic clocks placed inside and outside the device. The clock inside the field had moved forward in time slightly slower than the one outside, providing evidence of time travel, at least on a small scale.

Skeptical, I questioned him further. ""But professor, doesn't time travel go against the laws of physics? Wouldn't altering the flow of time have catastrophic consequences?""

Haskel chuckled, clearly amused by my skepticism. ""Ah, you're thinking in terms of the linear progression of time. But time, my dear student, is a concept that is much more fluid than we comprehend. The laws of physics, as we understand them now, may not be all-encompassing. Time travel could very well be within the realm of possibility if we expand our understanding of the universe.""

Listening to Haskel's words, I couldn't help but feel a mix of awe and doubt. His ideas were captivating, but also seemed too good to be true. After all, if time travel were indeed possible, why hadn't it been discovered before?

With a sly grin, Haskel seemed to read my mind. ""Ah, the paradoxes of time travel! That is precisely why we haven't encountered any time travelers from the future, my dear student. The creation of time loops, grandfather paradoxes, and the potential to alter the course of history make time travel an incredibly risky endeavor. We may simply be unaware of its existence due to self-imposed regulations by future time-traveling civilizations.""

His argument made sense to me, but I still had reservations. ""Professor, if time travel were possible, wouldn't we have seen some evidence of it already? Like historical artifacts out of place or anomalies in the historical record?""

Haskel's eyes twinkled mischievously. ""Oh, my dear student, the evidence might be right in front of our noses, but we may not recognize it. After all, who's to say that some of the unexplained mysteries throughout history weren't caused by time travelers? Perhaps those strange disappearances or seemingly impossible inventions were the work of travelers from the future.""

As I pondered his words, my mind swirled with possibilities. The thought of exploring different time periods and witnessing historical events firsthand was undeniably thrilling. Yet, my rational side reminded me of the risks and complexities involved.

In the end, our conversation left me with a sense of wonder and curiosity. While Haskel's experiment and theories were compelling, I still approached the concept of time travel with caution. It was a subject that would continue to captivate me for years to come, prompting me to delve deeper into the intricate relationship between time and the laws of physics.

As I left Haskel's office, I couldn't help but smile, knowing that the timeless pursuit of knowledge would always be intertwined with humanity's fascination with the concept of time travel. And perhaps, one day, we may unlock its secrets and unravel the mysteries of the universe.",1,
"Nan Wallace couldn't believe her rotten luck. Stuck in her room with a sprained ankle, she watched from her window as her friends skipped and played in the sunshine, heading towards the much-anticipated picnic. It wasn't fair. She had been looking forward to that picnic for weeks, and now she was cooped up like a bird with a broken wing.

Her older sister, Maude, popped her head into the room, sympathy etched on her face. ""I'm sorry, Nan. It must be really frustrating.""

Nan sighed, her eyes welling up with tears. ""I just wanted to have fun with everyone. And now I'm stuck here.""

Maude sat down on the edge of Nan's bed and patted her sister's arm. ""I know it's tough, but maybe we can find a way to make the afternoon a little brighter.""

Nan brightened at the idea. ""How?""

Maude smiled mischievously. ""Well, we could tidy up our room. You know how much it bugs Dad when it's a mess. Plus, it'll take your mind off things.""

Nan considered the suggestion, and a small smile tugged at her lips. ""Yeah, I guess that could work. It'll keep me busy, at least.""

As they tidied, Nan's thoughts drifted to Florrie Hamilton, a quiet girl in their class who had been left out of the picnic invite. Nan had always thought Florrie should be included, even if she wasn't part of their social circle. She had seen the hurt on Florrie's face when the invitations were passed around, and it didn't sit right with Nan.

""Hey, Maude,"" Nan spoke up, breaking the silence. ""What if we invite Florrie over? She's all alone too.""

Maude paused, a thoughtful look crossing her face. ""That's a great idea, Nan! She probably feels left out. Let's write her a note inviting her to keep you company this afternoon.""

Nan smiled, her spirits lifting. ""Yes! And maybe we can get to know her better. She seems nice.""

Maude agreed, grabbing a pen and paper. They carefully crafted a heartfelt note, inviting Florrie to spend the afternoon with them. Nan sealed the envelope, excitement bubbling inside her. Maybe this sprained ankle wasn't such a disaster after all. Maybe it was a chance for Nan to reach out and make a new friend.

Meanwhile, Florrie Hamilton sat in her room, feeling hurt and alone. She had watched as her classmates excitedly planned for the picnic, secretly hoping that she, too, would be invited. But when the invitations were handed out, Florrie's heart sank. She was left out once again, feeling invisible and unwanted.

As she sat at her desk, contemplating transferring to the public school, a knock came at her door. Florrie opened it to find the mailman holding a letter. Confusion flickered across her face as she took the envelope, her name scrawled on the front.

She opened the letter, her eyes widening in surprise as she read the kind invitation from Nan Wallace. The invitation warmed her heart and she couldn't help but smile. Maybe there was hope for friendship and inclusion after all.

Florrie made her decision. She would accept Nan's invitation, hoping it would be a chance to break free from the isolation she felt. Tucking the letter into her pocket, she made her way to the Wallace's house, her heart pounding with anticipation.

Nan couldn't contain her excitement as the doorbell rang. She hobbled to the door, propped up on crutches, and swung it open to find Florrie standing there, a nervous smile on her face.

""Hey, Florrie!"" Nan greeted her, a broad grin stretching across her face. ""I'm so glad you could come. Let's have some fun!""

Florrie stepped inside, the warmth of Nan's words enveloping her. As they spent the afternoon chatting, playing games, and sharing stories, Nan discovered that Florrie had a quick wit and a kind heart. She realized that excluding Florrie from their social circle was a mistake, and she was determined to change that.

By the end of the day, Nan and Florrie had become fast friends. Nan had found a kindred spirit in Florrie, someone who understood what it felt like to be left out. And Florrie had found a place where she belonged, where her presence was valued and cherished.

As the sun set and Nan's ankle throbbed with pain, she couldn't help but feel grateful for her sprained ankle. It had led her to a newfound friendship, a bond that she knew would last a lifetime. And from that day forward, Nan made it her mission to ensure that no one felt excluded or alone, spreading the message of friendship and inclusion to her entire class.",1,
"Once upon a time in a quaint little town called Yonderland, there lived a person named Charlie who had a knack for finding themselves in the most peculiar situations. Charlie was an ordinary individual with an extraordinary sense of humor. They had a zest for life and an uncanny ability to find the silver lining in even the most perplexing predicaments.

One fateful day, while exploring the local flea market, Charlie stumbled upon a vendor selling a set of exquisite china. Mesmerized by its delicate design and vibrant colors, Charlie couldn't resist the temptation. Little did they know that this set of china held a hidden surprise.

Unbeknownst to Charlie, the china had a unique secret mechanism. As they placed it on the table at home, the plates, cups, and saucers began to speak. Yes, you read that right – they could talk!

""Goodness me! Who is this strange person who bought us?"" exclaimed the teapot with a haughty British accent.

""I have no idea, darling. But we must make the most of this situation,"" replied the sugar bowl, equally posh.

Charlie, taken aback by the sudden conversational abilities of their new china, couldn't help but burst into laughter. They were amused by the unexpected social commentary that had entered their life.

From that day forward, Charlie's daily routine became anything but ordinary. Morning tea turned into an engaging discussion on the latest gossip in the neighborhood.

""Did you hear what happened at the Jenkins' house last night?"" hushed the creamer, as if divulging a well-kept secret.

""I did, my dear. The scandalous behavior of Mr. Jenkins is simply too much to bear!"" replied the teacup, feigning shock.

Charlie couldn't help but be entertained by the hidden lives of the china. They enjoyed sipping their tea while listening to the tea set's witty banter. It was like being at a royal tea party every day.

But the talking china had another trick up their sleeve. Whenever Charlie had guests over for tea, the conversation became even livelier. The china's observations on human behavior were sharp, astute, and often hilariously accurate.

""Look at that gentleman over there. He's trying so hard to impress his date, but he keeps fumbling with his words!"" snorted the teacup, unable to contain its amusement.

""I'm afraid his chances at romance are as delicate as we are,"" joined in the teapot, chuckling heartily.

Charlie's guests, initially startled by the talking china, soon found themselves enchanted by the wit and humor that filled the room. The awkwardness of social gatherings melted away as everyone embraced the surreal experience of conversing with a tea set.

Word of this extraordinary china spread throughout Yonderland, drawing curious visitors from far and wide. Charlie's home became a hotspot for tea enthusiasts, socialites, and those who simply craved a good laugh.

The talking china became the talk of the town, attracting media attention and even landing Charlie a spot on a popular talk show. Their sense of humor and lighthearted outlook on life captivated audiences, leaving them in splits of laughter.

However, as with all good things, there came a time when Charlie had to bid farewell to their beloved tea set. The china, having served its purpose, was ready to move on to a new home and bring joy to another unsuspecting soul.

On the day Charlie packed the china into boxes, each piece whispered words of gratitude and farewells.

""Fare thee well, dear Charlie! You have brought us immeasurable joy,"" whispered the saucer.

""Indeed, we shall be forever indebted to your incredible sense of humor,"" added the creamer, teary-eyed.

As Charlie gazed at the now-silent china, they couldn't help but feel a twinge of nostalgia. The talking china had not only brought laughter but had also taught them the power of finding humor in the everyday absurdities of life.

From that day forward, Charlie carried the lessons and memories of the talking china in their heart. They continued to see the world through a lens of humor and remained in awe of the unexpected surprises life had to offer.

And so, dear reader, let this story remind you to embrace the humor in the mundane, to listen closely to the whispers of everyday objects, and to never underestimate the power of a simple cup of tea. After all, you never know what hidden surprises may be waiting to make you smile.",1,
"In the darkest corners of my mind, a flicker of light emerges. It is the idea of creating a new gospel, a sacred text born of reflection and imagination. A gospel without a central charismatic leader, but a collective voice of twelve individuals bound together by a shared purpose. A purpose to rebel against an oppressive empire, to seek justice, to struggle, and to find hope.

In this new gospel, the birth of children takes on a profound significance. These children, destined to challenge the empire, are conceived in a world where hope seems distant. They emerge from the wombs of mothers who have known suffering, who have tasted the bitterness of a life dictated by the empire's iron fist. Like Moses, these children are marked with a destiny to lead their people out of bondage, but this time, the bondage is not physical, but spiritual and emotional.

The tale begins with Mary, a young woman of humble origins. She gives birth to a son, Yeshua, whose name means ""salvation."" Mary and her husband Joseph are not royalty, but ordinary people living under the shadow of the empire. Yeshua's birth heralds a new era, a time when the downtrodden and oppressed will rise up against their oppressors.

Yeshua grows up, surrounded by a group of loyal companions. These twelve individuals, diverse in their backgrounds and experiences, come together in defiance of the empire's tyranny. They witness the injustices inflicted upon their people daily, their hearts heavy with grief and anger. They yearn for change, for a world where justice prevails and compassion reigns.

In this new gospel, miracles are not supernatural phenomena but acts of resistance. Instead of turning water into wine, Yeshua and his companions turn despair into determination, hatred into love, and oppression into liberation. They heal the wounded, both physically and spiritually, and their message spreads like wildfire.

The empire, threatened by this rising movement, takes drastic measures. Its soldiers descend upon the villages, seeking to crush the rebellion. Innocent lives are lost, and the wailing of grieving parents fills the air. Yet, amidst the pain, a glimmer of hope persists. The parents, consumed by their anger and grief, become the voice of the oppressed, demanding justice for their fallen children.

The narrative of this gospel alternates between the voices of the twelve companions and the grieving parents. We hear their anguish, their determination to carry on their children's legacy. We witness their struggle, their unwavering belief in the power of love and justice. These voices intertwine, painting a powerful tapestry of resilience and hope.

In the end, this new gospel is not about a single messianic figure but about the collective strength of ordinary people. It is a testament to the capacity of humanity to rise above adversity, to challenge systems of oppression, and to forge a path towards a better future. It is a call to action, inspiring readers to question the status quo and to reimagine the world in which we live.

As I reflect upon this creation, I am reminded of the words of Isaiah: ""The desert and the parched land will be glad; the wilderness will rejoice and blossom. Like the crocus, it will burst into bloom; it will rejoice greatly and shout for joy."" In the creation of this new gospel, I find solace in the belief that even in the darkest of times, the seeds of hope can take root and flourish.",1,
"Clement Augustus Trott (December 14, 1877 – April 14, 1950) was a highly decorated officer in the United States Army with the rank of major general in the United States Army. A West Point alumnus, Trott participated in the Philippine–American War and World War I, where he distinguished himself as chief of staff of the 5th Division.[1] Following the War, Trott remained in the Army and rose through the ranks to General officer rank. He completed his career as Commanding general, Fifth Corps Area in September 1941, shortly before the United States entry into World War II.[2][3] Clement A. Trott was born on December 14, 1877, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin as the son of immigrants from Germany. Following high school, he received an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, where he became active in the baseball team and was nicknamed ""The Baron"" due to his German ancestry. Trott graduated on February 15, 1899, with Bachelor's degree and was commissioned second lieutenant in the Infantry branch.[3][4] Many of his classmates became general officers later: Samuel T. Ansell, Charles M. Bundel, Clifton C. Carter, Stanley D. Embick, Robert C. Foy, Stuart Heintzelman, Charles D. Herron, Evan H. Humphrey, Frederick B. Kerr, Leon Kromer, Duncan K. Major Jr., Edward M. Markham, George Van Horn Moseley, Ephraim G. Peyton, George S. Simonds or James A. Woodruff.[1] Following the graduation, Trott was ordered to Camp Baker near Walker, Minnesota, for service with 7th Infantry Regiment. The Seventh Infantry was ordered to San Carlos, Arizona, in May 1900 and Trott participated in the guarding of the Mexican Border until August that year, when it was ordered to Fort Logan, Colorado. He was promoted to first lieutenant on September 15, 1900, and joined 5th Infantry Regiment at Fort Sheridan, Illinois.[3] Trott embarked for the Philippines by the end of March 1901 and participated in the combats against Moro insurgents until November 1903, when he was ordered back to the United States. Upon his arrival stateside, he was stationed at the Plattsburg Barracks until he was ordered to the Infantry and Cavalry School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in August 1904. Trott graduated with honors in July of the following year and attended the Command and Staff College also located there.[3] He completed the instruction on August 20, 1906, and was promoted to the rank of captain. Trott was subsequently ordered back to the United States Military Academy at West Point and assumed duty as an Instructor in the Department of Law. Due to his interest in the baseball during his tenure at the Academy as a Cadet, Trott accepted additional duty as Manager of the team and brought famous coach Sammy Strang to the team.[3][1] Trott left West Point in August 1910 and joined his old outfit, 5th Infantry Regiment at Plattsburg Barracks. He served as an Instructor at the Army School of the Line at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, from August to December 1912 and then sailed with 8th Infantry Regiment back to the Philippines.[3] His second tour in that country ended in September 1915, when he returned stateside and joined the 24th Infantry Regiment at the Presidio of San Francisco. Trott served with his new regiment at Presidio until February 1916, then moved to the Fort D.A. Russell, Wyoming. However during Pancho Villa Expedition in March that year, the 24th Infantry joined the punitive expedition to Mexico and participated in the skirmishes with Villa's forces.[3] By the beginning of November 1916, Trott returned to the United States and assumed duty as Assistant Professor of Military Science and Tactics at the University of Illinois. During his tenure there, the United States entered the World War and Trott was given a new assignment. He was promoted to major on May 15, 1917, and ordered to Fort Sheridan, Illinois, where he assumed duty, first as Company and then battalion commander within the Officers' Training Camp.[3] Trott was promoted again, this time to the temporary rank of lieutenant colonel, on August 5, and ordered to Camp Sherman, Ohio, where he joined the newly activated 330th Infantry Regiment, part of the 83rd Division. He was tasked with training of guardsmen of the Ohio National Guard until December 1917 when he embarked for France.[3] In January 1918, Trott joined the British 21st Division as an observer. After three weeks in that capacity, he was ordered to the General Staff College of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) at Langres. He completed the course and served there as an instructor until the end of June 1918, when he served again as an observer, now with the American 1st and 2nd Divisions during the hard fighting around Château Thierry and Montdidier.[3] Trott then rejoined the 83rd Division in early July and served as chief of staff of the division, commanded by Major General Edwin F. Glenn, which had only recently arrived in France. The division did not see any action as a complete formation and instead provided replacements for other combat formations in the AEF. Trott was meanwhile promoted to the temporary rank of colonel on July 30, and soon joined the headquarters of the 5th Division as its chief of staff under Major General John E. McMahon.[3] The 5th Division, a Regular Army formation (although in practise it was composed largely of draftees with only a relatively small number of professional soldiers), was a completely different kind of formation than his previous experience with the 83rd Division, and Trott had the opportunity to participate in the planning and execution of large-scale military operations. He served in that capacity during the Battle of Saint-Mihiel in mid-September and then during the Meuse–Argonne offensive in October-November that year. Trott distinguished himself in this capacity and was praised by both commanders of the 5th Division, McMahon and his successor, Major General Hanson E. Ely, who relieved McMahon in mid-October. Following the armistice with Germany in November 1918, the 5th Division marched to Luxembourg, where it was stationed near Esch-sur-Alzette for occupation duty until the",0,
"Market Lavington is a civil parish and large village with a population of about 2,200 on the northern edge of Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire, England, 5 miles (8.0 km) south of the market town of Devizes. The village lies on the B3098 Westbury–Urchfont road which skirts the edge of the Plain. The parish includes the hamlets of Northbrook, Lavington Sands and Fiddington Sands. There was a Roman settlement near the present parish church, which was followed by a Saxon settlement, including a cemetery which was used in the 5th to 7th centuries. Thus the area was continuously occupied from the late Roman period until the establishment of the medieval planned town in the 13th century.[2][3] The archaeology was assessed in advance of housebuilding to the northwest of the church in 1991–5, and building of the community centre and car park southwest of the church in 2006.[4] Domesday Book has two entries for Laventone, with a large combined population of 38 households, 12 acres of woodland and three mills.[5] The ancient parish included the detached tithing of Gore, about 2 miles (3.2 km) south of Market Lavington church, where a manor was recorded in Domesday Book;[6] this area was transferred to West Lavington in 1884 and is now farmland.[7] At the same time the tithing of Fiddington, a narrow strip separating Market Lavington from Easterton, was transferred from West Lavington.[7] In 1254 Richard Rochelle, a landowner, was granted a charter to hold a weekly market, which competed with markets at Devizes and Steeple Ashton. Markets continued to be held until the mid-19th century.[7] Thomas Tanner, who became Bishop of St Asaph, was born in 1674 at Market Lavington where his father (also Thomas) was vicar.[8] The Wessex Ridgeway, a long-distance footpath following the ancient track known as The Ridgeway, runs along the top of the escarpment above Market Lavington and passes within half a mile of the village.[7] Market Lavington developed around a crossroads where an east–west road (now the B3098) met a north–south road from Devizes to Salisbury. The latter was closed south of Market Lavington after the War Department purchased land for military use in 1889, and the road through West Lavington (now the A360) became the route to Salisbury.[7] The Stert and Westbury Railway, part of the route from London to Taunton, was built through the parish by the Great Western Railway in 1900. At the same time a station named Lavington was built a short distance outside Market Lavington parish, north of Littleton Panell where the line crosses the A360. It was closed in 1967 and no local stations remain; the nearest stations are Pewsey and Westbury. Market Lavington was formerly considered to be a town and received a Royal Charter to hold a weekly market in the year 1254.[3] The civil parish elects a parish council.[9] It is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for all significant local government functions. The parish falls in the Lavingtons and Erlestoke electoral ward. This ward starts in the south at West Lavington and stretches north to Worton. The total population of the parish taken at the 2011 census was 5,857.[10] The village has a co-op supermarket, a pharmacist, a butcher, a post office, a florist, a hairdresser, a pub, a café and other small businesses. There is also a nursing and residential home. The parish church of St Mary, in the west of the village, is from the late 13th century.[11] There is evidence of an earlier building in fragments of 12th-century stonework remounted as a cornice in the south porch, and other fragments elsewhere in the church.[12] In the 14th century the porch was added and the aisles widened; the tower was completed in the 15th.[11] The six bells in the tower were recast in 1876.[13] During restoration by Ewan Christian in 1864, the chancel arch, the nave and parts of the aisle walls were rebuilt, and buttresses were added to the south aisle. Further restoration in 1910 added the organ chamber and choir vestry, and the east wall was rebuilt.[7] There is a 14th-century piscina. Monuments include a marble carving of a mourning woman by John Flaxman, a memorial to Thomas Sainsbury (died 1795).[11] The building was recorded as Grade I listed in 1962.[11] The tithing of Easterton became a separate parish with its own church in 1874.[7] The benefices of Market Lavington and Easterton were united in 1962.[14] Today the church is part of the Lavingtons, Cheverells & Easterton benefice, a group of five churches.[15] A chapel at Gore was in existence by 1322. Around 1550 the chapel was still standing but unused, and it was later demolished.[7] The Old House, a 14th-century manor house, is Grade I listed. Built of roughcast stone with some brick, it contains the structure of an early medieval double-aisled open hall, described by Historic England as the only example in Wiltshire. The building was remodelled in the late 17th or early 18th century, and restored in 1875.[16] A new manor house, with service block and stables, was built in 1865 by Ewan Christian for Edward Pleydell-Bouverie, a politician and Ecclesiastical Commissioner. The construction is red brick, with blue brick patterning and stone dressings.[17] Since 1926 it has been owned by Dauntsey's School.[18] The Market Lavington Community Hall was built in 2007 and can accommodate 160 people seated or 250 standing.[19] It hosts regular activities such as short mat bowls, quilting, Tai Chi, yoga, Women's Institute, art, table tennis, a community choir and ballroom dancing.[20] The Old School has been converted into community space for hire and hosts clubs such as Girl Guides and a play group.[21] Market Lavington Museum is sited in the old Schoolmaster's Cottage at the back of the churchyard. It is open Saturday, Sunday, Wednesday and Bank Holiday afternoons from 2.30 to 4.30 pm between 1 May and 30 October.[22] Lavington School is a secondary school with a sixth form. The village also has a primary school, St Barnabas. The village is",0,
"wouldn't, knowing everyone on Earth was dead except Pa and Ma and Sis and you? Even at that, I don't suppose I should have been surprised. We all see things now and then. Ma has some pretty bad ones, to judge from the way she bugs her eyes at nothing and just screams and screams and huddles back against the blankets hanging around the Nest. Pa says it is natural we should react like that sometimes. When I'd recovered the pail and could look again at the opposite apartment, I got an idea of what Ma might be feeling at those times, for I saw it wasn't a young lady at all but simply a light--a tiny light that moved stealthily from window to window, just as if one of the cruel little stars had come down out of the airless sky to investigate why the Earth had gone away from the Sun, and maybe to hunt down something to torment or terrify, now that the Earth didn't have the Sun's protection. I tell you, the thought of it gave me the creeps. I just stood there shaking, and almost froze my feet and did frost my helmet so solid on the inside that I couldn't have seen the light even if it had come out of one of the windows to get me. Then I had the wit to go back inside. Pretty soon I was feeling my familiar way through the thirty or so blankets and rugs Pa has got hung around to slow down the escape of air from the Nest, and I wasn't quite so scared. I began to hear the tick-ticking of the clocks in the Nest and knew I was getting back into air, because there's no sound outside in the vacuum, of course. But my mind was still crawly and uneasy as I pushed through the last blankets--Pa's got them faced with aluminum foil to hold in the heat--and came into the Nest. * * * * * Let me tell you about the Nest. It's low and snug, just room for the four of us and our things. The floor is covered with thick woolly rugs. Three of the sides are blankets, and the blankets roofing it touch Pa's head. He tells me it's inside a much bigger room, but I've never seen the real walls or ceiling. Against one of the blanket-walls is a big set of shelves, with tools and books and other stuff, and on top of it a whole row of clocks. Pa's very fussy about keeping them wound. He says we must never forget time, and without a sun or moon, that would be easy to do. The fourth wall has blankets all over except around the fireplace, in which there is a fire that must never go out. It keeps us from freezing and does a lot more besides. One of us must always watch it. Some of the clocks are alarm and we can use them to remind us. In the early days there was only Ma to take turns with Pa--I think of that when she gets difficult--but now there's me to help, and Sis too. It's Pa who is the chief guardian of the fire, though. I always think of him that way: a tall man sitting cross-legged, frowning anxiously at the fire, his lined face golden in its light, and every so often carefully placing on it a piece of coal from the big heap beside it. Pa tells me there used to be guardians of the fire sometimes in the very old days--vestal virgins, he calls them--although there was unfrozen air all around then and you didn't really need one. He was sitting just that way now, though he got up quick to take the pail from me and bawl me out for loitering--he'd spotted my frozen helmet right off. That roused Ma and she joined in picking on me. She's always trying to get the load off her feelings, Pa explains. He shut her up pretty fast. Sis let off a couple of silly squeals too. Pa handled the pail of air in a twist of cloth. Now that it was inside the Nest, you could really feel its coldness. It just seemed to suck the heat out of everything. Even the flames cringed away from it as Pa put it down close by the fire. Yet it's that glimmery white stuff in the pail that keeps us alive. It slowly melts and vanishes and refreshes the Nest and feeds the fire. The blankets keep it from escaping too fast. Pa'd like to seal the whole place, but he can't--building's too earthquake-twisted, and besides he has to leave the chimney open for smoke. Pa says air is tiny molecules that fly away like a flash if there isn't something to stop them. We have to watch sharp not to let the air run low. Pa always keeps a big reserve supply of it in buckets behind the first blankets, along with extra coal and cans of food and other things, such as pails of snow to melt for water. We have to go way down to the bottom floor for that stuff, which is a mean trip, and get it through a door to outside. You see, when the Earth got cold, all the water in the air froze first and made a blanket ten feet thick or so everywhere, and then down on top of that dropped the crystals of frozen air, making another white blanket sixty or seventy feet thick maybe. Of course, all the parts of the air didn't freeze and snow down at the same time. First to drop out was the carbon dioxide--when you're shoveling for water, you have to make sure you don't go too high and get any of that stuff mixed in, for it would put you to sleep, maybe for good, and make the fire go out. Next there's the nitrogen,",0,
"s'incamminava alla casa di Orsola dell'Arca. La gente si fermava a veder passare il prete incedente a capo nudo, con la stola violacea, sotto l'ampio ombrello scarlatto, tra le lanterne portate dai clerici accese. La campanella squillava limpidamente accompagnando i salmi susurrati dal prete. I cani vagabondi si scansavano nei vicoli al passaggio. Mazzanti cessò di ammucchiare la neve all'angolo della piazza e si scoprì la zucca inchinandosi. Si spandeva in quel punto dal forno di Flaiano nell'aria l'odore caldo e sano del pane recente. Nella casa dell'inferma gli astanti udirono gli squilli, e udirono su per le scale il salire dei vegnenti. La vergine Orsola era sul letto, supina, tenuta dallo stupore della febbre, da una sonnolenza inerte, con la respirazione frequente rotta da i rantoli. Posava sul guanciale la testa quasi nuda di capelli, la faccia d'un colore quasi ceruleo ove le palpebre erano semichiuse sopra gli occhi vischiosi e le narici parevano annerite dal fumo. Ella faceva con le mani scarne piccoli gesti incerti, vaghi conati di prendere qualche cosa nel vuoto, strani segni improvvisi che davano quasi un senso di terrore a chi stava da presso; e nelle braccia pallide le passavano le contrazioni dei fasci muscolari, i sussulti dei tendini; e a volte un balbettamento inintelligibile le usciva dalle labbra, come se le parole le si impigliassero nella fuliggine della lingua, nel muco tenace delle gengive. Nella stanza si faceva quel silenzio tragico che suole precedere gli avvenimenti supremi, un silenzio dove il respiro dell'inferma e i gesticolamenti incerti e le irruzioni rauche della tosse aggravavano l'attesa della morte. Dalle finestre aperte entrava l'aria pura ed uscivano le esalazioni della malattia. Un vivo baglior bianco si rifrangeva dalla neve coprente i cornicioni e i capitelli corintii dell'arco di Portanova: il fiore cristallino dei ghiaccioli scintillava d'iridi all'altezza della stanza. Nell'interno, su le pareti, pendevano grandi medaglie sacre d'ottone, imagini di santi. Sotto un vetro una Madonna di Loreto tutta nera il volto il seno le braccia, come un idolo barbarico, luceva nella sua veste adorna di mezze lune d'oro. In un angolo, un piccolo altare candido portava un vecchio crocifisso di madreperla, tra due boccali turchini di Castelli pieni d'erbe aromatiche. Camilla, la sorella, l'unica parente, presso al letto, pallidissima, tergeva le labbra nerastre e i denti incrostati dell'inferma con un lino umido di aceto. Don Vincenzo Bucci, il medico, seduto, guardava il pomo d'argento della bella mazza, le belle corniole incise ch'egli aveva negli anelli delle dita, aspettando. Teodora La Jece, una tessitrice vicina, stava ritta, in silenzio, tutta intenta nell'atteggiare a dolore la faccia bianca e lentigginosa, gli occhi d'acciaio, la bocca crudele. — _Pax huic domui_ — disse il prete entrando. Apparve all'uscio Don Gennaro Tierno, lunghissimo e smilzo su piedi enormi, con i movimenti di un bruco che si snodi. Veniva dietro di lui Rosa Catena, una femmina che avea fatto pubblica professione d'impudicizia al suo tempo verde e che ora si salvava l'anima assistendo i moribondi, lavando i cadaveri, vestendoli e accomodandoli nella bara, senza prender mercede. Nella stanza di Orsola tutti erano in ginocchio, chini la faccia. L'inferma non udiva; una stupefazione intensa le teneva ancora i sensi. E l'aspersorio si levò su di lei, lucido nell'aria, aspergendo il letto. — _Asperges me, Domine, hyssopo, et mundabor..._ Ma Orsola non sentì l'onda purificatrice che la rendeva più bianca della neve innanzi al suo Signore. Ella stirava davanti a sè con le dita fragili le coperte, aveva un moto tremulo nelle labbra, nella gola il gorgoglio della parola che ella non poteva profferire. — _Exaudi nos, Domine sancte..._ Allora uno scoppio di pianto risonò fra le parole latine, e Camilla nascose nella sponda del letto la faccia rigata di lacrime. Il medico s'era accostato e teneva fra le dita inanellate il polso di Orsola. Egli voleva scuoterla, apprestarla a ricevere il Sacramento dalle mani del sacerdote di Gesù Cristo, fare che ella porgesse la lingua all'ostia. Orsola balbettò, gesticolò ancora vagamente nel vuoto, mentre la sollevavano su i guanciali. Ella non udiva se non un tintinno nei nervi dell'orecchio perturbati, a tratti un gridìo, a tratti una musica. Come fu sollevata, subitamente il rossore livido della faccia si mutò in un pallore di cadavere; la vescica di ghiaccio cadde dalla testa sul lenzuolo. — _Misereatur..._ Porse ella finalmente la lingua tremante, coperta d'una crosta mista di muco e di sangue nerastro, dove l'ostia vergine si posò. — _Ecce agnus Dei, ecce qui tollit peccata mundi..._ Ma ella non ritirò la lingua a quel contatto, perchè non aveva conscienza di quel che faceva: lo stupidimento non era rotto dal lume dell'Eucaristia. Camilla guardava con gli occhi rossi pieni di terrore e di dolore quella faccia terrea dove ogni segno di vita mancava a poco a poco, quella bocca aperta che pareva la bocca di uno strangolato. Il prete seguitava, nella solennità del suo ministerio, le preghiere latine lentamente. Tutti gli altri rimanevano genuflessi, sotto il diffuso albore che fuori dalla neve suscitava il meriggio. L'odore del pane caldo salì col vento e fece fremere le papille del naso ai clerici. — _Oremus!..._ Agli eccitamenti del medico Orsola richiuse le labbra. La riadagiarono supina; poichè il prete entrava nel sacramento dell'Estrema Unzione. I clerici genuflessi ripetevano sommessamente l'antifona dei sette Salmi penitenziali. — _Ne reminiscaris._ Teodora La Jece metteva di tratto in tratto un singulto soffocato, coperta il volto con le palme, a' piedi del letto. Rosa Catena stava ritta, accanto, con un occhio semichiuso da cui le colava di continuo un liquido giallognolo e con l'altro occhio cieco e bianco per un'albùgine; scorreva un rosario, mormorando. E mentre i Salmi sommessamente dal pavimento si elevavano, su quel mormorio confuso dominava la formula sacra del prete ungente in croce gli occhi, gli orecchi, le narici, la bocca, le mani dell'inferma inerte. — _... indulgeat tibi Dominus quidquid per gressum deliquisti. Amen._ Fu Camilla che scoperse i piedi della sorella: apparvero tra le coperte due piedi gialli, squamosi, lividi nelle unghie, che al",0,
"Orlando Ruben Jordan[1] (born April 21, 1974)[5] is an actor, stuntman, and semi-retired American professional wrestler. He is best known for his tenure in WWE on its SmackDown brand, where he was a one-time United States Champion and for his time with Impact Wrestling. Jordan made his WWE television debut on the May 31, 2003 episode of Velocity, where he defeated Jamie Noble.[6] On June 26, 2003, Jordan made his first SmackDown! appearance as a face at Madison Square Garden, where he lost to John Cena.[7] Although he did not win the match, he was impressive enough that when Cena attacked Jordan after the match was over, The Undertaker, with whom Cena was feuding, came to the ring and helped Jordan to his feet.[7] On the October 2 episode of SmackDown!, Jordan defeated Big Show via countout when Big Show had to run to the restroom after eating a burrito laced with laxatives.[8] Jordan answered an open challenge hosted by Brock Lesnar on the January 29, 2004 episode of SmackDown!, where he was quickly defeated.[9] After an absence of multiple months due to family issues,[10] Jordan returned on the August 5 episode of SmackDown!, defeating René Duprée. Later in the night, Jordan turned heel by saving WWE Champion John ""Bradshaw"" Layfield (JBL) from an attack by the Undertaker.[11] On the August 12 episode of SmackDown!, Jordan joined JBL's Cabinet, where he was appointed ""Chief of Staff"". Jordan faced the Undertaker in the main event later that night, losing by disqualification after JBL attacked Undertaker mid-match.[12] On the August 26 episode of SmackDown!, Jordan once again faced Undertaker, this time with JBL's WWE Championship on the line. The match once again ended in a disqualification after JBL again interfered.[13] On the November 25 episode of SmackDown!, Jordan and JBL defeated Eddie Guerrero and Booker T, after interference from The Basham Brothers,[14] who were made the Cabinet's ""co-secretaries of defense"" on the December 2 episode of SmackDown!.[15] Jordan, JBL and the Bashams were defeated by Booker T, the Undertaker and Eddie Guerrero in a 4-on-3 handicap match on the December 9 episode of SmackDown!.[16] Jordan entered his first Royal Rumble match at the Royal Rumble on January 30, 2005, but was eliminated by Booker T.[17] After JBL began a feud with John Cena over the WWE Championship leading up to WrestleMania 21, Jordan faced off with Cena on the March 3 edition of SmackDown!. Jordan defeated Cena with the help of JBL to win the United States Championship, his first and only title in WWE.[18] In a dark match before WrestleMania 21, Jordan competed in a 30-man battle royal, won by Booker T.[19] His first major successful title defense was against Heidenreich at Judgment Day.[20] At The Great American Bash, Jordan began feuding with the newly drafted Chris Benoit. Jordan defeated Benoit and retained his United States Championship after removing the turnbuckle pad and shoving Benoit head-first into the exposed steel and covered him for the win.[21] Benoit continued to chase Jordan for the title. He finally defeated Jordan (in a record 25.5 seconds) at SummerSlam to win the title.[22] Following this quick match, Jordan attempted to win the United States Championship back on multiple occasions, leading to 3 consecutive losses with all matches lasting less than a minute. The first rematch lasted 23.4 seconds.[23] During the second rematch, Jordan actually almost knocked out Benoit with a punch in the opening moments but still lost at 22.5 seconds, which was even faster than the first match.[24] During the third match, Jordan stalled until the time, which was being displayed on the TitanTron, went over 25 seconds.[25] He got so excited when his time went over 30 seconds that he dropped his guard and Benoit took the opportunity to lock on the Crippler Crossface for a win at the 49.8 second mark.[25] On the October 14 edition of SmackDown!, Jordan stated that he mastered every counter to Benoit's signature Crippler Crossface. Jordan also stated, if he tapped out to the Crippler Crossface, Jordan would quit this business. Jordan lived up to his words by countering every Crippler Crossface attempt by Benoit. The match ultimately ended after Jordan tapped out to Benoit's Sharpshooter. After those unsuccessful rematches, Jordan later broke away from JBL, although both made a few appearances together later on. When Booker T got injured halfway through his Best of Seven series for the United States Championship, he needed a replacement to face Chris Benoit.[26] As the series was at 3–1 in Booker's favor, Booker T only needed his replacement to win one match in order to become the United States Champion.[26] Jordan approached him about the position, but Booker T and his wife Sharmell belittled him and made jokes about his quick submission losses to Benoit.[26] Booker asked Randy Orton to substitute for him.[26] After Orton failed to win the deciding match, leading Jordan to once again ask for the position the next week,[26][27] Booker T once again turned Jordan down after belittling him.[27] During the sixth match in the series, Jordan jumped the rail, grabbed Booker T's crutch, and hit Benoit for a disqualification finish and thus giving Benoit the victory and tying the Best of Seven Series at 3–3.[27] The next week, Jordan ran to ringside to attempt to halt Booker T from winning the championship, but was unable to prevent Orton from eventually beating Benoit to win the series for Booker T. On the January 20 episode of SmackDown!, Jordan faced and lost to Randy Orton after Booker's wife Sharmell distracted the SmackDown! senior official referee Nick Patrick, before Booker hit him with a leg crutch. After the match, Chris Benoit saved him from Booker and Orton, turning him face for the first time since 2004. Jordan was then pushed down to Velocity and won several matches there. Jordan made his final SmackDown! appearance on the May 12 episode of SmackDown! in a backstage segment, telling Nunzio that he had seen someone who looked like his partner Vito",0,
"that curled so reprovingly. [Illustration: _In his mind was the certainty: This is no dream._] She had gone psycho. Had fled from the Cowl into the dreadful Outside, seventy-two hours ago. Gone to join that fanatical group of Venusian Colonists, those outlaw schizoids who planned to start over on Venus. ""Pat!"" Greg's hand reached as though she weren't just a three-dim image. ""Listen, Pat! Thank the Codes, you haven't blasted yet. I've been crazy, waiting for this call. Pat, I can't even go into integrated anesthesia without you around. My dreams don't seem to focus right."" ""That's too bad, Greg,"" she said. He moistened his lips slowly. He slid his hand toward the warning button beneath the table. Her eyes didn't notice, never left his face. Accusative, sad eyes. He felt sick. He pushed the button. Now! Now Drakeson up on the apartment roof would trace the point of her call. He'd chart her location with the rhodium tracker beams. Then the two of them would go and pick Pat up and prevent that insane, suicidal, one-way trip to Venus. She might consider it a very unfair thing, but then she was psycho. She'd be glad of it, after she was brought back, brain-probed, and re-conditioned. The thought made Greg even more ill. Brain-probing and re-conditioning involved months of a kind of mental agony that no one could adequately describe. The words were enough to give anesthetic nightmares to any Citizen. But, it was for the good of the Cowls, and of the psychos. Her voice was sad too, like her eyes. ""I was hoping you would join me, Greg. Anyway, I called to tell you that in about five hours, we're blasting. This is goodby."" He said something. Anything. Keep her talking, listening. Give Drakeson a chance to employ the rhodium tracker, and spot her location. A kind of panic got loose in Greg's brain. ""Pat, don't you have any insight at all? Can't you see that this is advanced psychosis, that--"" She interrupted. ""I've tried to explain to you before, Greg. But you've always preferred anesthesia. You loathe reality. But I'm part of reality."" Yes. He had dreams. The anesthetic cubicles, Stage Five where a man was master of thalamic introjection, dream imagery. A stage where any part of reality was supposed to have faded into utter inconsequence. But Pat Nichols had always been a part of his conditioned personality pattern. By taking her out of it, fate had struck him with an unbalance in psyche that disturbed the sole objective of life--to dream. ""But that's a suicide trip, Pat, and you'll never have a chance to be cured of your schizophrenia, even if you do get to Venus--"" Her interruption had weariness in it. ""Goodby, Greg. I'm sorry for you. That silly status quo, and futile dreaming. It will never let you realize what a fine man you are. You'll decay and die in some futile image. So goodby, Greg. And good dreaming."" She was gone from the screen. Maybe from earth, unless he got out there and stopped her before that suicide ship rocketed out from its hidden subterranean blast tube. * * * * * Greg Hurried. He didn't realize he could function so rapidly in the world of physical reality. In seconds he had zipped thin resilient aerosilk about his body, and was running across the wide plastic mesh roof toward the heliocruiser in which Drakeson was waiting. Greg felt the physical power flow as he ran. It sickened him. The conditioners kept the body in good shape, but only to allow the cortical-thalamic imagery faculties to function better. Actual physical business like this was revolting to any Cowl citizen. Any sort of physical and materialistic activity, divorced from anesthesia, might be a sign of encroaching psychosis. That was the fear. That fear of psychosis that might lead to violence. To change. The Cowls over the Cities protected them from any physical interference with an absolutely stabile, unchanging and static culture. But the Cowls hadn't been able to protect the Citizenry from insanity. During the past year, psychosis had been striking increasingly, without warning, indiscriminately. Greg dropped down beside the thin ascetic figure at the controls. He grabbed Drakeson's arm. ""Did you pick it up, Drake?"" ""Uh-huh,"" Drakeson drawled. His mouth was cynical, his gray eyes somber. ""Traced it down to a ten meter radius, but it's underground. About five miles out of Old Washington, just inside the big radioactivated forest east of the Ruins. About half an hour's flight as the crow might fly. If there was a crow left."" ""Then let's go. Lift this gadget out of here!"" A spot of nausea bounced into Greg's stomach at Drakeson's reference to what the big Chain blow-up had done to almost all high cellular life forms, including crows. Only insects and a few shielded humans had withstood the radiation. Most higher complex cellular organisms had paid for their complexity. But thanks to the establishment of the Cowled Cities and the Codes of non-change, non-violence, they wouldn't have to pay again. No chance for social change now that might lead to another such disaster. If they could only trace the cause for this psychosis epidemic-- Greg hadn't thought about it at all until Pat had started talking peculiarly, then when she had broken up completely and left the Cowl, then it had hit home, hard. The heliocruiser lifted slowly under Drakeson's awkward guidance. Only the Controllers, the Control Council Guards, could work the gadgetry of the City with practiced ease. Everybody else, naturally, was conditioned to various anesthesia states, and had no reason to deal with materialistic things. The cruiser lifted until it was flying directly beneath the opaque stuff of the Cowl, lost in the dazzling rainbows of sunlight shattering through. Drakeson said. ""We'll keep up here. Maybe the Controllers won't see us."" ""What?"" A peculiar coolness slid along Greg's spine. ""Maybe they won't see us,"" repeated Drakeson, and then he smiled wryly. ""Listen,",0,
"""....and most poor suckers are starving to death!"" My god, this past week was SO full!! First of all, it was a very busy week at urlLink work... This is a pic of my little cubicle that encapsulates my Being far more than any other location on Earth. As Wednesday came around I was getting serious cabin fever, so when urlLink Leela spontaneously invited me to some friend's urlLink Comic Book release hosted in urlLink The Coral Room , I was ready to go. Who doesn't love a huge wall of LIVE Mermen and Mermaids!? I called my pal Paul who was also synchronistically, spontaneously available, and we headed out after work to meet Leela. That night turned out to be surprisingly profound as Paul and I talked about Loss, Grief, Consciousness, Transformation, and Love. Although I have had a great support group around me throughout my oddly-quiet breakup with Nick, I have to give Paul the trophy for ""Greatest Breakthrough from Grief while in a Synchronistic, Spontaneous Environment among Swimming Mermaids and Too-Loud 80s Punk Rock"" ! Most people who are close to me tend to step back when I am grieving, angry, or lost and confused, because I am such a control-freak that I have convinced everyone I can do everything better by myself. That's a reality I prefer most of the time, but one that can bite me on the ass when I am really lonely or in need of a profound breakthrough. I think the resonance of what Paul had to say was amplified by the innocence through which it was delivered, because it was less advice and more of a personal story. Paul was sharing his perception of a friendship in his own life that had caused him a great deal of grief, depression, and anxiety. This friendship was one in which Paul would have preferred more, and one in which the friend was allowing a blur to occur between that ""friendship"" and ""more"". This had become frustrating and painful for quite a while, but over time Paul realized that most of the pain had come from his own EXPECTATIONS of the friend, and not from the friend. Paul finally allowed himself to see just how much the friend did Love Paul, how much the friend gave to his fullest capacity in his own way, and just because it was not in the way that Paul expected or wanted, it was still a depth of giving from the friend that had to be recognized. So when Paul basically let go of the inner demand for the friend to fit that expectation, Paul was able to finally Love and Be Loved in a more intimate and meaningful way. It is all bittersweet, but it struck a very powerful chord in me about Nick. Nick has always given me every ounce of Love he can manage. I know that. The fact that he will not love me in the way I want him to love me does not negate the reality of his important love for me in his way. As Paul spoke to me about his friend, a forgiveness toward myself and for Nick swept over me to the point of tears. I kept myself composed, of course, but I was feeling a relief from the anger and resentment toward Nick that I hadn't felt before. It was like I finally ""got it"". You know, on the surface it can easily look like Paul or I have ""made excuses"" for the behavior of the other person we wanted so much to be with, but that's not the case. The reason I am secure in my genuine realization is because Nick has never intentionally hurt me, as Paul can say about his friend, too. It would be one thing if these guys had been mean or insulting and then I accepted these lame philosophies just to make myself feel better, but in both relationships, Paul and I agree that our guys were 100% giving of 100% of what they could. It actually put into perspective how, ironically, Paul and I were the ones lacking in our efforts to ""love"". It put into perspective how conditional we had become. I can't say the grieving is over, but I can say that my night with Paul probably removed weeks, if not months, of time from the process. Thank you, Paul. And thanks to all of my friends for any part of support you have given me across my life! We said goodnight to Leela (who was just the cutest social butterfly of the night), and eventually Paul and I ended up at urlLink Barracuda. Paul and I continued some great conversation, but we quickly had to succumb to the tiny stage show that we had not realized would be ensuing. A 7-foot tall drag queen who could have easily passed as urlLink Kathy Griffin came onto the stage with a bored demeanor and a deep voice only to lip-synch to awful songs and pass around a spitoon for money. Despite my lack of interest in the show, the night wore on, and Paul left, and I stayed, and eventually I heard a lip-synched song by PEACHES. I know my friend urlLink MYKEY loves her, but I hate that raunchy, rap-like, rough shit. But that night/morning was the first time I actually found myself liking her, too! The atmosphere, the liquor, the people, the overall great night,... all contributed to my finally saying ""YES!"" to urlLink Peaches! Now I LOVE that song, ""fuck the pain away""! It was deliciously obnoxious and perfect for the night. I didn't get home until around 5am. I won't say why. I stayed home from work on Thursday to recuperate... Thursday night had been a plan for going to urlLink Chelsea's Clearview Classics Night at the theater. It was the first time we had heard about these great classics being played on the big screen every week! We were so excited because they were playing",0,
"Christmas dinner is a meal traditionally eaten at Christmas. This meal can take place any time from the evening of Christmas Eve to the evening of Christmas Day itself.[1] The meals are often particularly rich and substantial, in the tradition of the Christian feast day celebration, and form a significant part of gatherings held to celebrate the arrival of Christmastide.[2] In many cases, there is a ritual element to the meal related to the religious celebration, such as the saying of grace.[3] The actual meal consumed varies in different parts of the world with regional cuisines and local traditions. In many parts of the world, particularly former British colonies, the meal shares some connection with the English Christmas dinner involving roasted meats and pudding of some description. The Christmas pudding and Christmas cake evolved from this tradition. In countries without a lengthy Christian tradition, the Christmas meal may be more heavily influenced by popular culture. An example of this is Japan, where a KFC takeaway meal is traditionally consumed.[4] Indian people cook a variety of foods, including biryani with chicken or mutton, chicken and mutton curry, followed by cake or sweets like kheer.[5] Long established Christian communities such as Goan Catholics have pork dishes and beef dishes as part of their main course of their Christmas dinner. These include pork vindaloo and sorpatel. For dessert, a dish called bebinca is popular.[6] The Kerala Christian community is the largest Christianity community in India.[7] Keralites celebrate Christmas with midnight mass, Christmas carols and food. The Christmas celebration begins on Christmas Eve. Churches are decorated, Christmas trees and bigger Christmas stars from youth groups are the biggest attractions in Kerala. Pork Vindaloo, Beef Stew, and Mappas are the common dishes served during Christmas dinner. Keralites people go from home to home to celebrate and dance during carol time. All Keralites—including Hindus and Muslims—celebrate Christmas and share sweets and gifts and participate in carols and town celebrations.[4] Plum cake is a famous dessert in Kerala and family come together and cut the cake after the midnight mass, the cutting of plum cakes after Christmas mass is treated as a tradition in Kerala. Occasionally, wines commonly made from grapes as well as pineapples, gooseberries or other fruit, are consumed.[8] Japanese Christmas cake, a white sponge cake covered with cream and decorated with strawberries, is often consumed, and Stollen cake, made locally, is widely available. A successful advertising campaign in the 1970s made eating at KFC around Christmas a national custom. Its chicken meals are so popular during the season that stores take reservations months in advance.[9] Lebanese Christians celebrate Christmas dinners. The feast, usually on the night of the 24th and lunch on the 25th, is a big one. The family gets together at both meals, and some have the leftovers from the dinner prior to the lunch the next day. The traditional offering for Christmas is sugar-coated almonds. Roast turkey is the most common choice of meal.[10] Roasted duck, Lebanese salad (Tabbouleh) and pastries such as honey cake are common. Beirut celebrates Christmas by conducting glamorous and big Christmas parties. Western-style poinsettias, community Christmas trees, and Christmas lights are very popular. Christmas dinner in the Philippines is called Noche Buena following Hispanic custom, and is held towards midnight of 24 December. This usually comes after the entire family has attended the late evening Mass called the Misa de Gallo (""Mass of the Rooster""). The centerpiece of the Noche Buena is often the hamón, which is usually a cured leg of pork. This is usually served with queso de bola, literally a ball of edam cheese covered in red wax. Other ubiquitous dishes are pasta and, for dessert, fruit salad. The dinner would usually be accompanied by tsokolate or hot cocoa, made with pure, locally grown cacao beans. Some families prefer tsokolate prepared from tablea or pressed cocoa powder tablets that are either pure or slightly sweetened. Most of the foods served on Noche Buena are fresh and usually prepared the day of Christmas Eve.[11] Middle-class and affluent families tend to prepare sumptuous feasts which may include any of the following: lechón or spit-roasted pig; lumpia; escabeche; adobo; rellenong manok or stuffed chicken; roast turkey;[citation needed] mechado (beef stew); kaldereta (spicy beef stew); paella; and other traditional fiesta dishes. Less well-off families would opt for a more economical Noche Buena; the organising of even a simple gathering despite financial difficulties reflects the paramount importance in Filipino culture of familial (and, by extension, communal) unity. This focus on the family is common to all Filipino socio-economic classes and ethnic groups that observe Christmas. Most – if not all – members from the branches or extended families in a clan are expected to partake of the Noche Buena. Relatives living abroad, especially OFWs, are highly encouraged to return home for the occasion, as it is the most important Filipino Christian holiday of the year. Most families prefer to exchange Christmas presents right after dinner, contrary to the Western custom of opening presents on Christmas morning. In Austria, Christmas Eve is the celebration of the end of the pre-Christmas fast. Christmas is usually celebrated only by Christians. Christmas Eve is historically the day that the tree is decorated and lit with real candles, so that the Christkindl may visit. Christmas Day is a national holiday in Austria and most Austrians spend the day feasting with their family. Fried carp, Sachertorte, and Christmas biscuits (Lebkuchen and Weihnachtssterne) are eaten, as are many other chocolate delicacies including edible Christmas ornaments.[12] Christmas dinner is usually goose, ham served with Gluhwein, Rumpunsch, and chocolate mousse. A traditional Christmas meal in the Czech Republic is fried carp and potato salad which are eaten during Christmas dinner on the evening of 24 December.[13] It is often accompanied by a fish soup prepared from carp leftovers (head or bones) or a traditional Czech mushroom dish Kuba. Many households also prepare a great variety of unique Christmas biscuits to offer to visitors. These are prepared many",0,

"into the tight opening. ""Get that junk out of the way!"" he yelled, and his voice roared over the noise of the truck's engine. Kurt snapped his head around, his blue eyes thinning, then recognition spread humor crinkles around his eyes and mouth. ""All right, sir,"" he said. ""Just a second while I jump out, and I'll lift it out of your way."" ""With bare hands?"" Cutter said. ""With bare hands,"" Kurt said. Cutter's laugh boomed, and as he rounded the front of the truck, he struck the right front fender with his fist. Kurt roared back from the cab with his own laughter. He liked joking harshly with Kurt and with the rest of the truck drivers. They were simple, and they didn't have his mental strength. But they had another kind of strength. They had muscle and energy, and most important, they had guts. Twenty years before Cutter had driven a truck himself. The drivers knew that, and there was a bond between them, the drivers and himself, that seldom existed between employer and employee. The guard at the door came to a reflex attention, and Cutter bobbed his head curtly. Then, instead of taking the stairway that led up the front to the second floor and his office, he strode down the hallway to the left, angling through the shop on the first floor. He always walked through the shop. He liked the heavy driving sound of the machines in his ears, and the muscled look of the men, in their coarse work shirts and heavy-soled shoes. Here again was strength, in the machines and in the men. [Illustration] And here again too, the bond between Cutter and his employees was a thing as real as the whir and grind and thump of the machines, as real as the spray of metal dust, spitting away from a spinning saw blade. He was able to drive himself through to them, through the hard wall of unions and prejudices against business suits and white collars and soft clean hands, because they knew that at one time he had also been a machinist and then tool and die operator and then a shop foreman. He got through to them, and they respected him. They were even inspired by him, Cutter knew, by his energy and alertness and steel confidence. It was one good reason why their production continually skimmed along near the top level of efficiency. Cutter turned abruptly and started up the metal-lipped concrete steps to the second floor. He went up quickly, his square, almost chunky figure moving smoothly, and there was not the faintest shortening in his breath when he reached the level of his own office. Coming up the back steps required him to cross the entire administration office which contained the combined personnel of Production Control, Procurement, and Purchasing. And here, the sharp edge of elation, whetted by the walk past the loading dock and the truck drivers and the machine shop and the machinists, was dulled slightly. On either side of him as he paced rapidly across the room, were the rows of light-oak desks which contained the kind of men he did not like: fragile men, whether thin or fat, fragile just the same, in the eyes and mouth, and pale with their fragility. They affected steel postures behind those desks, but Cutter knew that the steel was synthetic, that there was nothing in that mimicked look of alertness and virility but posing. They were a breed he did not understand, because he had never been a part of them, and so this time, the invisible but very real quality of employer-employee relationship turned coldly brittle, like frozen cellophane. The sounds now, the clicking of typewriters, the sliding of file drawers, the squeak of adjusted swivel chairs--all of it--irritated him, rather than giving him inspiration, and so he hurried his way, especially when he passed that one fellow with the sad, frightened eyes, who touched his slim hands at the papers on his desk, like a cautious fawn testing the soundness of the earth in front of him. What was his name? Linden? God, Cutter thought, the epitome of the breed, this man: sallow and slow and so hesitant that he appeared to be about to leap from his chair at the slightest alarm. Cutter broke his aloofness long enough to glare at the man, and Linden turned his frightened eyes quickly to his desk and began shuffling his papers nervously. Some day, Cutter promised himself, he was going to stop in front of the man and shout, ""Booo!"" and scare the poor devil to hell and back. He pushed the glass doors that led to his own offices, and moving into Lucile's ante-room restored his humor. Lucile, matronly yet quick and youthfully spirited, smiled at him and met his eyes directly. Here was some strength again, and he felt the full energy of his early-morning drive returning fully. Lucile, behind her desk in this plain but expensive reception room, reminded him of fast, hard efficiency, the quality of accomplishment that he had dedicated himself to. ""Goddamned sweet morning, eh, Lucy?"" he called. ""Beautiful, George,"" she said. She had called him by his first name for years. He didn't mind, from her. Not many could do it, but those who could, successfully, he respected. ""What's up first?"" he asked, and she followed him into his own office. It was a high-ceilinged room, with walls bare except for a picture of Alexander Hamilton on one wall, and an award plaque from the State Chamber of Commerce on the opposite side of the room. He spun his leather-cushioned swivel chair toward him and sat down and placed his thick hands against the surface of the desk. Lucile took the only other chair in the office, to the side of the desk, and flipped open her appointment pad. ""Quay wants to see you right away. Says it's important."" Cutter nodded slightly and closed his eyes. Lucile",0,
"a strange sound began. Thin, scratchy, inaudible more than a yard away, weary but still cocky, there leaked from the shape in the hollow the sound of a human voice. ""I've tried my hands and arms and they seem to work,"" it began. ""I've wiggled my toes with entire success. It's well on the cards that I'm all in one piece and not broken up at all, though I don't see how it could happen. Right now I don't feel like struggling up and finding out. I'm fine where I am. I'll just lie here for a while and relax, and get some of the story on tape. This suit's got a built-in recorder, I might as well use it. That way even if I'm not as well as I feel, I'll leave a message. You probably know we're back and wonder what went wrong. ""I suppose I'm in a state of shock. That's why I can't seem to get up. Who wouldn't be shocked after luck like that? ""I've always been lucky, I guess. Luck got me a place in the _Whale_. Sure I'm a good astronomer but so are lots of other guys. If I were ten years older, it would have been an honor, being picked for the first long jump in the first starship ever. At my age it was luck. ""You'll want to know if the ship worked. Well, she did. Went like a bomb. We got lined up between Earth and Mars, you'll remember, and James pushed the button marked 'Jump'. Took his finger off the button and there we were: _Alpha Centauri_. Two months later your time, one second later by us. We covered our whole survey assignment like that, smooth as a pint of old and mild which right now I could certainly use. Better yet would be a pint of hot black coffee with sugar in. Failing that, I could even go for a long drink of cold water. There was never anything wrong with the _Whale_ till right at the end and even then I doubt if it was the ship itself that fouled things up. ""That was some survey assignment. We astronomers really lived. Wait till you see--but of course you won't. I could weep when I think of those miles of lovely color film, all gone up in smoke. * * * * * ""I'm shocked all right. I never said who I was. Matt Hennessy, from Farside Observatory, back of the Moon, just back from a proving flight _cum_ astronomical survey in the starship _Whale_. Whoever you are who finds this tape, you're made. Take it to any radio station or newspaper office. You'll find you can name your price and don't take any wooden nickels. ""Where had I got to? I'd told you how we happened to find Chang, hadn't I? That's what the natives called it. Walking, talking natives on a blue sky planet with 1.1 g gravity and a twenty per cent oxygen atmosphere at fifteen p.s.i. The odds against finding Chang on a six-sun survey on the first star jump ever must be up in the googols. We certainly were lucky. ""The Chang natives aren't very technical--haven't got space travel for instance. They're good astronomers, though. We were able to show them our sun, in their telescopes. In their way, they're a highly civilized people. Look more like cats than people, but they're people all right. If you doubt it, chew these facts over. ""One, they learned our language in four weeks. When I say they, I mean a ten-man team of them. ""Two, they brew a near-beer that's a lot nearer than the canned stuff we had aboard the _Whale_. ""Three, they've a great sense of humor. Ran rather to silly practical jokes, but still. Can't say I care for that hot-foot and belly-laugh stuff myself, but tastes differ. ""Four, the ten-man language team also learned chess and table tennis. ""But why go on? People who talk English, drink beer, like jokes and beat me at chess or table-tennis are people for my money, even if they look like tigers in trousers. ""It was funny the way they won all the time at table tennis. They certainly weren't so hot at it. Maybe that ten per cent extra gravity put us off our strokes. As for chess, Svendlov was our champion. He won sometimes. The rest of us seemed to lose whichever Chingsi we played. There again it wasn't so much that they were good. How could they be, in the time? It was more that we all seemed to make silly mistakes when we played them and that's fatal in chess. Of course it's a screwy situation, playing chess with something that grows its own fur coat, has yellow eyes an inch and a half long and long white whiskers. Could _you_ have kept your mind on the game? ""And don't think I fell victim to their feline charm. The children were pets, but you didn't feel like patting the adults on their big grinning heads. Personally I didn't like the one I knew best. He was called--well, we called him Charley, and he was the ethnologist, ambassador, contact man, or whatever you like to call him, who came back with us. Why I disliked him was because he was always trying to get the edge on you. All the time he had to be top. Great sense of humor, of course. I nearly broke my neck on that butter-slide he fixed up in the metal alleyway to the _Whale's_ engine room. Charley laughed fit to bust, everyone laughed, I even laughed myself though doing it hurt me more than the tumble had. Yes, life and soul of the party, old Charley ... ""My last sight of the _Minnow_ was a cabin full of dead and dying men, the sweetish stink of burned flesh and the choking reek of scorching insulation, the boat jolting and shuddering and beginning to break up,",0,
"groaned again as several stevedores came out on the blastway lugging a harp, a base fiddle and a kettle drum. ""Come off it, Pitchblend,"" one of the stevedores said with a grin. ""I didn't see you staying away from the music hall."" That was true enough, Pitchblend Hardesty had to admit. He was a small, wiry man with amazing strength in his slim body and the lore of a solar system which had been bypassed by thirtieth century civilization for the lures of interstellar exploration in his brain. While the symphony--the all-girl symphony--had been playing its engagement at Triton's make-shift music hall, Hardesty had visited the place three times. ""Well, it wasn't the music, sure as heck,"" he told his critic now. ""Who ever saw a hundred girls in one place at one time on Triton?"" The stevedore rolled his eyes and offered Pitchblend a suggestive whistle. Hardesty booted him in the rump, and the stevedore had all he could do to stop from falling into the kettle drum. * * * * * Just then a loud bell set up a lonely tolling and Pitchblend Hardesty exclaimed: ""Prison break!"" The bell could be heard all over the two-hundred square miles of inhabitable Triton, under the glassite dome which enclosed the small city, the spaceport, the immigration station for nearby Neptune and the Interstellar Penitentiary. The bell hadn't tolled for ten years; the last time it had tolled, Pitchblend Hardesty had been a newcomer on Neptune's big moon. That wasn't surprising, for Interstellar Penitentiary was as close to escape-proof as a prison could be. ""All right, all right,"" Pitchblend snapped. ""Hurry up and get her loaded."" ""What's the rush?"" one of the stevedores asked. ""The gals ain't even arrived from the hotel yet."" ""I'll tell you what the rush is,"" Pitchblend declared as the bell tolled again. ""If you were an escaped prisoner on Triton, just where would you head?"" ""Why, I don't know for sure, Pitchblend."" ""Then I'll tell you where. You'd head for the spaceport, fast as your legs could carry you. You'd head for an out-going spaceship, because it would be your only hope. And how many out-going spaceships are there tonight?"" ""Why, just two or three."" ""Because all our business is in the daytime. So if the convict was smart enough to get out, he'll be smart enough to come here."" ""We got no weapons,"" the stevedore said. ""We ain't even got a pea-shooter."" ""Weapons on Triton? You kidding? A frontier moon like this, the place would be blasted apart every night. Interstelpen couldn't hold all the disturbers of the peace if we had us some guns."" ""But the convict--"" ""Yeah,"" Pitchblend said grimly. ""He'll be armed, all right."" Pitchblend rushed back to the manifest shed as the bell tolled a third time. He got on the phone and called the desk of the Hotel Triton. ""Hardesty over at the spaceport,"" he said. ""Loading foreman."" ""Loading foreman?"" The mild, antiseptic voice at the other end of the connection said it as you would say talking dinosaur. ""Yeah, loading foreman. At night I'm in charge here. Listen, you the manager?"" ""The manager--"" haughtily--""is asleep. I am the night clerk."" ""O.K., then. You tell those hundred girls of yours to hurry. Don't scare them, but have you heard about the prison break?"" ""Heard about it? It's all I've been hearing. They--they want to stay and see what happens."" ""Don't let 'em!"" roared Pitchblend. ""Use any excuse you have to. Tell 'em we got centrifigal-upigal and perihelion-peritonitus over here at the spaceport, or any darn thing. Tell 'em if they want to blast off tonight, they'll have to get down here quick. You got it?"" ""Yes, but--"" ""Then do it."" Pitchblend hung up. The escape bell tolled a fourth time. * * * * * His name was House Bartock, he had killed two guards in his escape, and he was as desperate as a man could be. He had been sentenced to Interstelpen for killing a man on Mars in this enlightened age when capital punishment had been abolished. Recapture thus wouldn't mean death, but the prison authorities at Interstelpen could make their own interpretations of what life-in-prison meant. If House Bartock allowed himself to be retaken, he would probably spend the remaining years of his life in solitary confinement. He walked quickly now, but he did not run. He had had an impulse to run when the first escape bell had tolled, but that would have been foolish. Already he was on the outskirts of Triton City because they had not discovered his escape for two precious hours. He could hole up in the city, lose himself somewhere. But that would only be temporary. They would find him eventually. Or, he could make his way to the spaceport. He had money in his pocket--the dead guard's. He had a guardsman's uniform on, but stripped of its insignia it looked like the jumper and top-boots of any spaceman. He had false identification papers, if needed, which he had worked on for two years in the prison printshop where the prison newspaper was published. He had.... Suddenly he flattened himself on the ground to one side of the road, hugging the gravel and hardly daring to breathe. He'd heard a vehicle coming from the direction of Interstelpen. It roared up, making the ground vibrate; its lights flashed; it streaked by trailing a jet of fire. House Bartock didn't move until the afterglow had faded. Then he got up and walked steadily along the road which led from Interstelpen to Triton City. * * * * * ""Girls! Hurry with your packing! Girls!"" Sighing, Matilda Moriarity subsided. The girls, obviously, were in no hurry. That would have been out of character. Matilda Moriarity sighed again. She was short, stocky, fifty-two years old and the widow of a fabulously wealthy interstellar investment broker. She had a passion for classical music and, now that her husband had been dead three years, she",0,
"Irrigation has played a crucial role in the development and success of agriculture in Australia. With a climate that often experiences extended periods of drought and limited rainfall, irrigation has been necessary to ensure water supply and maintain crop productivity. However, the history of irrigation in Australia is not without its challenges, including significant environmental impacts and the complex task of developing sustainable irrigation schemes.

The history of irrigation in Australia dates back to the early 19th century when European settlers began attempting to cultivate the arid land. They recognized the need for a reliable water supply to sustain agriculture and began constructing simple irrigation systems such as dams and channels. These early irrigation efforts were mainly focused on providing water for livestock and small-scale farming.

In the early 20th century, along with the expansion of agriculture, larger-scale irrigation schemes were developed. One of the most notable examples is the River Murray Irrigation Scheme, which aimed to divert water from the Murray River to support large-scale agricultural development in the Murray-Darling Basin. This project, which started in the late 1800s, involved the construction of hundreds of kilometers of channels, weirs, and reservoirs to deliver water to farms across a vast area. The River Murray Irrigation Scheme transformed arid landscapes into productive farmland, contributing significantly to Australia's agricultural output.

However, the expansion of irrigation schemes in Australia has not come without its challenges. One of the most significant challenges is the environmental impact of diverting water from rivers and wetlands. The Murray-Darling Basin, for example, is a vital ecosystem that supports a diverse range of flora and fauna. Diverting water from the rivers for irrigation can disrupt the natural flow patterns and lead to a decline in water quality. Reduced water flow can also impact wetland habitats, affecting migratory bird populations and other aquatic species. Furthermore, the extensive irrigation in some areas has led to soil salinization, where the build-up of salts reduces soil fertility and inhibits crop growth.

In recent decades, the Australian government has recognized the need to address these environmental challenges and promote sustainable irrigation practices. Water management policies have been introduced to ensure the efficient use of water resources and minimize environmental impacts. These policies include caps on water extraction, the implementation of water trading systems, and the introduction of water-efficient irrigation technologies. These initiatives aim to balance the needs of agriculture with the preservation of natural ecosystems.

Another challenge faced by irrigation in Australia is the increasing competition for water resources. As the population grows and urban areas expand, the demand for water from various sectors, including agriculture, industry, and households, has intensified. This has led to conflicts over water allocation and calls for more equitable distribution. In some cases, water scarcity and competition have resulted in water restrictions, impacting the viability of agricultural production.

The development of irrigation schemes in Australia has also faced challenges related to infrastructure and water governance. Building and maintaining irrigation infrastructure is a costly endeavor, requiring significant investment and ongoing maintenance. Furthermore, the fragmented nature of water management across different states and territories has resulted in complex governance structures, making it challenging to coordinate and manage water resources effectively.

Despite these challenges, irrigation continues to be a critical component of Australia's agricultural sector. It allows farmers to produce a wide range of crops, including fruits, vegetables, and grains, even in regions with low rainfall. Australian agricultural exports heavily rely on irrigation-dependent commodities such as rice, cotton, and wine grapes. Irrigation also contributes to rural economies by providing employment opportunities and supporting regional development.

In conclusion, irrigation has played a vital role in the history and development of agriculture in Australia. While it has provided essential water supply for crops and livestock, it has also posed significant challenges, particularly in terms of environmental impacts and water management. The Australian government continues to prioritize sustainable irrigation practices to balance agriculture's needs with environmental conservation. As water resources become increasingly scarce, it is crucial to strike a balance between irrigation demands, competing sectors, and the conservation of natural ecosystems.",1,
"Well, as the clock ticks on, I'm more and more worried about this situation with the job. I don't know what to think since she hasn't called me back. I left two messages yesterday and then one this morning to let her know what times I would be available today. But I also suggested Monday might be better, although I'd fit her in whenever it was convenient for her. Truth is, I'm swamped today. But I guess all I can do is wait. And pray. BTW, thank you to all my friends who have been praying for me over this. Today R goes to a birthday party right after school. T's mom doesn't drive and her hubby couldn't get off work until 4 p.m., so I'm picking her up, taking her to get the balloons and then over to the place where the party is - Chuck E. Cheese. Then I'll come back to the school and get T, R and two other kids whose mom can't make it. We'll all go to the birthday party, then head home. Tomorrow is the kick-off for the Library Summer Reading Program that R and I have done for the last 4 years. She loves it as you get stickers on a pamphlet for every several books the kids read and it's a theme with prizes for completing the program, usually books, which we've always gotten some really good ones. Don't know what the theme is this year yet. They have a bunch of activities for the kids -a moon jump, a bike safety and check station thing, balloon animal makers, face painting, etc. She'll have a blast. I just hope it's not as hot as it was last year! It was in the 90's and it was miserable. T and several other of her friends are going to be there, too, so she'll have a lot of people to hang around with while she explores. J has to work overtime, though, so he'll go on a bike ride with her after he gets off work as she's been begging him to spend so extra time with her. I want to try to sqeeze in getting some shoes for her, too. She doesn't have any sandels and I saw a cute pair on sale at K-Mart in the Sunday paper, so I want to run over there. It's not that close to our house, so it will take a bit, but I can't find flats that will fit her foot well any place around here that I've looked. Then I need to do some cleaning as my house is a pit! Finally found someone to take my Sunday School class this week. I don't know how many people I called before I found someone, but thankfully, I did. So I called my brother - who just got in town late last night (blush) - and let him know. He said to bring anything we want to the pot luck as everyone is just bringing stuff. So, I'll do something quick and easy. My other brother is coming here, then riding with us. R can hardly wait to see him. She's made two books for him - pages she staples together as books, then writes in them and draws pictures. They are both like: I love my Uncle K. I can't wait to see him on Sunday. He is the greatest Uncle ever. She just adores him! He'll love getting those! It's taken me all day to type this up, I've had so much going on. So, I'm writing again about the job. While I was gone, D called back and left a message saying she'd spent all that time locating a power cord for her digital transcribing machine and wants to see me on Monday to work everything out!!!! I'm so relieved and excited! Finally, a job! And I really feel like this is perfect for me, too. Yippee!!!! Went up to R's school for lunch with her today, but we got there late and the kids were in the lunchroom already. So we sat with her and R shared her second slice of pizza with J, as well as the orange juice she always takes but never drinks - lol. They make them take a fruit (the juice) and a veggie. She eats the cucumbers, no problem, and a number of other veggies, but when it come to fruit, she's picky. Apples, oranges, bananas, cherries and grapes about cover it. Then we hung out a little bit while she was at recess and then left. I picked up T's mom, G, and took her to get the ballooons and take the stuff over to Chuck E. Cheese. J helped us carrying everything. It was windy as all get out right when she was bringing the cake out, too! Been having a lot of tornado warnings. But, we got everything there successfully. Then, when we got the balloons, J went in for them. As he was coming out, a grandma, mother and two little kids, maybe 3 4, were walking in. Anyway, Jay walked out in the wind and acted like the 11 balloons were making him blow away. He actually did it really well. G and I laughed so hard we cried. Then I saw these little kids with their mouths dropped open and freaking out. They thought he was really being blown away! ROFL! It was just too perfect! The birthday party was fun, the grown-ups able to chat without worrying about the kids too much and the kids playing all the games and rides. The party went from about 3:50 when we got there until 7:00 or so. Exhausting and, of course, my girl had a little breakdown. She was upset that she only had so many tickets (although I tried to get her more, without her knowing) and so she was crying and ultimately tore up her receipt. I got a replacement, but told her no prize. We'll see",0,
"Blowfish, a species of fish known for their unique appearance and fascinating behaviors, have long been a subject of intrigue and caution due to their toxicity. Found in both saltwater and freshwater environments, blowfish are notorious for their ability to produce a potent toxin known as tetrodotoxin.

The history of blowfish toxicity can be traced back to ancient times. In ancient Greece, blowfish were considered a delicacy, much like they are today in some parts of the world. However, consuming blowfish was not without risk, as it was known that certain parts of the fish contained a deadly poison. In fact, the philosopher Socrates is said to have met his demise after consuming a blowfish.

Tetrodotoxin, the primary toxin found in blowfish, is a highly potent neurotoxin that affects the nervous system. It acts by blocking nerve signals, leading to paralysis and, in severe cases, respiratory failure. The liver, ovaries, and skin of blowfish are particularly rich in tetrodotoxin, making them the most dangerous parts to consume.

Blowfish poisonings, often referred to as ""Fugu poisoning"" in Japan, where the consumption of blowfish is a popular culinary tradition, have been well-documented throughout history. While strict preparation guidelines are followed to minimize the risk, there have been cases of accidental poisonings due to improper handling or misguided attempts to prepare the fish.

Interestingly, despite the potential dangers associated with blowfish, scientists have also found practical applications for their toxin. Tetrodotoxin derived from blowfish has shown promise in medical research and as a potential treatment for various conditions, including pain management. However, extensive research is still needed to fully understand the medicinal properties of this toxin.

One question that arises when discussing blowfish toxicity is why these fish produce such a dangerous substance. It is believed that the toxin serves as a defense mechanism, deterring potential predators from preying on blowfish. However, the evolution of tetrodotoxin production in blowfish raises intriguing questions about its origin and the underlying genetic mechanisms that enable these fish to produce such a potent toxin.

It is worth noting that blowfish should never be consumed without the supervision of trained professionals, as mishandling or improper preparation can have severe consequences. In regions where blowfish consumption is popular, chefs must undergo rigorous training and obtain special licenses to ensure the safety of their customers.

In conclusion, blowfish are remarkable creatures, known for their toxicity and the risk associated with consuming them. Tetrodotoxin, their potent neurotoxin, has posed dangers to those who have attempted to prepare or consume these fish without proper expertise. However, the toxin derived from blowfish has also shown potential in the field of medicine. The study of blowfish and their toxicity continues to captivate scientists, prompting them to explore the origins and genetic mechanisms behind this intriguing defense mechanism.",1,
"Wow! So much to write about! I think this is going to be a long one! Whew, where to start? I think I will leave the good news for the end and start at the beginning... Way back when I was a baby.... not that far back? Oh okay, why don't I start at last Monday instead. I usually take my brother to school on Monday mornings and act as his aid for the morning (he's in Kindergarten). But this week he had a special Dr's appointment and my mom needed my help getting there and then watching Nicholas (the 5 month old foster baby that is with her right now - he was a preemie so he's still tiny). So I got to play with the baby (which involved feeding him, burping him - which meant I got spit up all over, and rocking him to sleep) while my mom and John went in to see the Dr. The Occupational therapist was there too. We've been trying to figure out what John's disabilities are for months with not much luck. He has a lot of behavioral challenges and so far we haven't had much success. But we finally seem to be getting somewhere. This Dr. figures that one of the things he has is FAS and/or ADHD and has prescribed Ritalin. We're going to see if that makes a difference. If it works then we might be able to get down to the next layer and figure out what his actual disability is. This will hopefully also help us get funding for him to have a full time aid for Grade 1 next year. He's been on the meds for a few days now and they seem to be making a difference already. When situations have come up that would normally cause him to have a total melt down that lasts about and hour, he's still melted down but it's been short - like 5 minutes. I'm hoping that once he's adjusted to the meds he'll be even better. Anyway, back to my week, on Monday, after the appointment, I went to work. I'm working 30 hours a week now, which is good. Of course this week, the week I start with the more hours, registrations slowed down and I got so caught up I had to make up stuff to do. Of course, by the end of the week I got some new projects to do - like calling references for a bunch of the summer volunteers. That's actually kind of interesting and fun. And it's a nice variation from the regular data entry and organization that I do. I'm really enjoying work though. It's a fun job and I work with some great people. My job centers mostly around taking registrations for camps for the summer and organizing all the information that we need. But it also involves arranging kids in cabins and greeting them at the start of camp and that kind of stuff. I can't believe it is June already. The past few months have been such a blur. In another 2 weeks I head up to camp for the first training weekend (right now the camp office is based in Victoria, so I don't have to drive out to Shawnigan lake every day) June 19 and 20. Then on June 25 we move the office up to Camp and then 28th we have a full week of training and finally on July 5, the first camp starts, and from that point on it's going to be chaos and mayhem, and many young children running all around... It's going to be GREAT! The rest of my week has been pretty good too. Voice lesson on Monday night went pretty well. I still don't know when the recital is but my songs are getting better. I really should practice though. I only have 2 more days until my next lesson, and my Italian song still needs some help. Not to mention my Elvish. Then I went to visit with Timea and the babies. Markus and Ayden are just the cutest kids ever! After they went to bed Timea and I finished etching the mirror she made me as my birthday present. It's now attached the the medicine cabinet I built, but it's still sitting in the hallway because I have to wait to get help to put it up and I haven't' been home early enough the rest of the week. On Wednesday I went to Jocylyns house for dinner after work. Amanda, Stefan and Amanda also came. I got there first but it took a while to get in because her house is GINORMOUS! She told me to go around the side of the house and knock on the back door. Only problem is, there are about 12 back doors!!!!! I did eventually find the right one though. Okay, Jocey's house is just so AMAZING! I love it so much! It's Huge and it's old, I'm thinking 1800's - ish. It has a very colonial style and rooms and doors all over the place. There were 4 floors, complete with large open sitting rooms, a dining room with the most amazing little nook surrounded by windows and containing one of the 2 grand piano's! The stair cases are cool and windy. And there are like a million bathrooms, all with claw footed bath tubs. And on the upper levels there are long, long hallways with all sorts of rooms off of them. I swear there's a secret passage in there somewhere. Jocey's room is really cool. Small doorway and interesting shape but such an awesome attic bedroom - description wouldn't do it justice, but believe me - it's great! The best part of the house though was the long corridor in the basement. It's all concrete, white and sterile, and VERY narrow. It leads to an entrance under the main door to the house and there are a few small rooms off the hall that",0,

The Devil is the greatest enigma that has ever confronted the human intelligence. So large a place has Satan taken in our imagination, and we might also say in our heart, that his expulsion therefrom, no matter what philosophy may teach us, must for ever remain an impossibility. As a character in imaginative literature Lucifer has not his equal in heaven above or on the earth beneath. In contrast to the idea of Good, which is the more exalted in proportion to its freedom from anthropomorphism, the idea of Evil owes to the presence of this element its chief value as a poetic theme. The discrowned archangel may have been inferior to St. Michael in military tactics, but he certainly is his superior in matters literary. The fair angels--all frankness and goodness--are beyond our comprehension, but the fallen angels, with all their faults and sufferings, are kin to us. There is a legend that the Devil has always had literary aspirations. The German theosophist Jacob Böhme relates that when Satan was asked to explain the cause of God’s enmity to him and his consequent downfall, he replied: “I wanted to be an author.” Whether or not the Devil has ever written anything over his own signature, he has certainly helped others compose their greatest works. It is a significant fact that the greatest imaginations have discerned an attraction in Diabolus. What would the world’s literature be if from it we eliminated Dante’s _Divine Comedy_, Calderón’s _Marvellous Magician_, Milton’s _Paradise Lost_, Goethe’s _Faust_, Byron’s _Cain_, Vigny’s _Eloa_, and Lermontov’s _Demon_? Sorry indeed would have been the plight of literature without a judicious admixture of the Diabolical. Without the Devil there would simply be no literature, because without his intervention there would be no plot, and without a plot the story of the world would lose its interest. Even now, when the belief in the Devil has gone out of fashion, and when the very mention of his name, far from causing men to cross themselves, brings a smile to their faces, Satan has continued to be a puissant personage in the realm of letters. As a matter of fact, Beelzebub has perhaps received his greatest elaboration at the hands of writers who believed in him just as little as Shakespeare did in the ghost of Hamlet’s father. Commenting on Anatole France’s _The Revolt of the Angels_, an American critic has recently written: “It is difficult to rehabilitate Beelzebub, not because people are of one mind concerning Beelzebub, but because they are of no mind at all.” How this demon must have laughed when he read these lines! Why, he needs no rehabilitation. The Devil has never been absent from the world of letters, just as he has never been missing from the world of men. Since the days of Job, Satan has taken a deep interest in the affairs of the human race; and while most writers content themselves with recording his activities on this planet, there never have been lacking men of sufficient courage",0,
"""Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved."" How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them? And how can they preach unless they are sent? As it is written, ""How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!""

The answer is certainly simple for us but our fellow Somali Muslims will not understand this. We know that Somali Muslims call us “the walking dead” who can drop any time because they can usually take our lives at their will. We all remember the Mogadishu underground house church where 12 of the 14 members were assassinated for their faith several years ago. For a Somali Muslim, a faith in Christ brings “death and destruction” but for us, Somali Christians, a faith in Christ Jesus brings eternal salvation—Liibaan, Dr. Gobe, Professor Xaaji, among others [Somali martyrs], know this first hand for they were killed for their faith and they are with the living Lord now. So for us, calling on the name of the Lord can bring to us physical death but our persecutors can’t touch our soul! Verse 13 clearly tells us that everyone who calls on the name of Jesus will be saved. Let us examine now what other passages of the Bible say about salvation in the name of the Lord. Salvation in the Bible 27Just as man is destined to die once, and after that to face judgment, 28so Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many people; and he will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him. Hebrews 9. 28""Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Matthew 11. 16""For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. 17For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. 18Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of God's one and only Son. John 3. 17The Spirit and the bride say, ""Come!"" And let him who hears say, ""Come!"" Whoever is thirsty, let him come; and whoever wishes, let him take the free gift of the water of life. Revelation 22. 32 And everyone who calls on the name of the LORD will be saved; for on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be deliverance, as the LORD has said, among the survivors whom the LORD calls. Joel 2. It indeed sounds too good to be true that the Lord Jesus died for the sins of all sinners or that he would take the sins of some who are “deep” in sin. Martin Luther calls this “the blessed exchange” because Jesus takes our ugly sins and gives us his righteousness. In verse 14, Paul asks three basic and thoughtful questions: 1. How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? 2. How can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? 3. How can they hear without someone preaching to them? The answer should also be basic but thoughtful: 1. One can’t call for help unless one believes help is available! 2. One can’t believe in Christ unless one hears of him! 3. Since one can’t hear of Christ without a preacher, we should all preach (Mt 28:19-20) Verse 15 tells us that we should all share the Good News for we are all the ambassadors of the living Lord “As the Father has sent me, I am sending you” John 20:21. Apostle Paul also said ““For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to boast of, for necessity is laid upon me; yes, woe is me if I do not preach the gospel!"" 1Corinthians 9:16. “Feet” tell the preparation to preach the Good News “With your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace (Ephesians 6:15).

"Harrie Irving Hancock was an accomplished American chemist and writer who left a lasting impact on children's literature. Known for his captivating storytelling, he is particularly remembered for his fictional depiction of a German invasion of the United States. This article will delve into his life, career, and notable works.

Born on April 12, 1866, in Hancock County, Indiana, Harrie Irving Hancock grew up with a keen interest in science and literature. After completing his education, he pursued a career in chemistry. He worked as a chemist for several years, delving into research and experiments in the field. However, his true passion lay in writing, and he eventually focused his career in that direction.

Hancock began his writing career in the late 19th century, contributing articles and short stories to various publications. His work gained recognition and acclaim, particularly in the realm of children's literature. He had a unique ability to capture the imagination of young readers, blending adventure, suspense, and educational elements into his stories.

One of Hancock's most notable works is his fictional depiction of a German invasion of the United States, a theme that fascinated readers during the early 20th century. The series, titled ""The Invasion of the United States,"" was set in a fictional near-future where Germany successfully invades and occupies America. The storylines revolved around American resistance against the invading forces, exploring themes of patriotism, bravery, and the resilience of the American spirit.

The series encompassed a total of twenty-six books, with each book adding depth to the narrative. The first book, ""The Invasion of the United States: Battle of Gettysburg,"" introduced readers to the initial conflict and the American response. As the story progressed, Hancock delved into various aspects of the invasion, including military strategies, political intrigue, and the impact on civilians. The series also featured strong characters who embodied American values and showcased the struggle against oppression.

Hancock's depiction of the invasion was not solely based on action and adventure. He skillfully weaved historical and political context into the narrative, giving readers a broader understanding of the events and the consequences of the invasion. Moreover, his unique perspective shed light on the anxieties and fears prevalent during that era, reflecting the concerns surrounding geopolitical conflicts and the possibility of invasion.

Hancock's work, particularly ""The Invasion of the United States"" series, resonated strongly with readers at the time. The books were not only entertaining but also tapped into a sense of national identity and unity. They instilled in readers a deep appreciation for the courage and sacrifices made by those who defended their homeland.

Outside of the German invasion series, Hancock wrote numerous other books for children. His storytelling prowess and ability to engage young readers set him apart from his contemporaries. Many of his works focused on adventure, exploration, and the triumph of good over evil. Some of his notable titles include ""The Motor Boat Club Series"", ""The Boy Allies Series,"" and ""The High School Boys' Series.""

Throughout his career, Harrie Irving Hancock established himself as a respected author in the realm of children's literature. His books, including the fictional depiction of a German invasion of the United States, continue to captivate readers even today. Hancock's ability to impart important values while entertaining his audience solidifies his legacy as a significant figure in American literature.",1,
"big and strapping for a woman, but otherwise not unattractive with her lusterless hair, slightly thick-featured face, small sagging bosom and heavy-calved legs. ""I'll take your bags,"" she told Ellaby, and led him from the station. She walked quickly, but not too quickly. You always had to find the happy medium, thought Ellaby. For Ellaby, finding the happy medium had always come easy. Ten years ago, when Ellaby had been graduated from the High Falls secondary school, the four words MOST LIKELY TO SUCCEED had been printed under his picture in the yearbook. It was expected by everyone: young Ellaby had learned his three R's--rules, rights, responsibilities--satisfactorily. Ellaby had neither excelled nor failed: he was by nature a first class citizen. Running to keep up with the too big, too long-legged Dorcas Sinclair who was carrying one of his suitcases in each hand, Ellaby was led from the pneumo-station. The splendid, unimaginative geometric precision of the Capitol stretched out before him in the dazzling summer sunlight, the view serving as a leaven for Ellaby's usually phlegmatic disposition. He could feel his spirits rise, his heart thump more rapidly, speeding the sudden flow of adrenalin through his body. [Illustration] This was the city. It was here where the fruits of whatever had gone wrong in Ellaby's upbringing or whatever had gone wrong in the linear arrangement of his genes would ripen. It was here where Ellaby, modal Ellaby would pass his tests for top-secret work; unsuspected, average Ellaby, would write his name in flaming letters across the pages of history. It was here where Ellaby would kill the Dictator. And after that--what? Chaos? A new order based not on modality but something else? Ellaby wasn't sure. No one in the organization knew for sure. The concept was staggering to Ellaby. It was the system--or nothing. Well, let the others worry about it. They did the planning. Ellaby was only the executioner. * * * * * The house was like all the others on the block, all the others in the Capitol, a grimly solid structure of lets-pretend brick fronting on a street which faded into distant haze, straight as a ruled line, to north and south, crossing the east-west avenues at precise right angles every five hundred feet. The grid pattern city, Ellaby remembered from his rights course in school, (every man has the right to a room and bath in any city as long as he is employed) made the best use of available space for houses. The strip city is unnecessary in time of peace--was there ever, had there ever been any other time? the radial city is preferred for rapid transportation, being the accepted pattern in the great economic hubs and ports like Greater New York and Hampton Roads. ""You will have to live here with me"" Dorcas Sinclair told Ellaby, ""until you pass your tests for employment. I don't have to tell you how much depends on the outcome of those tests, Ellaby."" ""But I can't fail them. I thought you knew my record."" With an unnerving unmodal violence, Dorcas Sinclair's strong fingers dug into the flabby muscle of Ellaby's upper arm. ""Well, you had better not,"" she said, her large teeth hardly parting to let the sounds out. Ellaby was suddenly alarmed. He had had very little truck with people of this sort. They were as unpredictable as the weather in High Falls which having a population under twenty-five thousand, had never qualified for weather control. Unlike modal man, they had never been exhaustively studied. Their likes and dislikes were not catered to, but their passions couldn't be predicted, either. ""Ease up, Dorcas,"" a deep voice said from the doorway leading to the kitchen. Ellaby stared in that direction gratefully. It was indecent for a woman, for anyone, to expose her emotions that way. Ellaby was almost inclined to thank the stranger. ""Stranger, nothing!"" Ellaby blurted aloud. Ellaby's face reddened and he apologized. ""I didn't mean to raise my voice,"" he explained. ""You surprised me."" ""I guess you didn't expect to find me here, at that. You haven't changed much, Ellaby."" Automatically, Ellaby mumbled his thanks for the compliment. Sam Mulden, though, had changed. He'd always been a radical. He wore his hair cropped too short. He was tall and thin, his elbows and knees exposed by the tunic he wore like knots on gnarled, living wood. Mulden looked older. He hadn't bothered to dye his graying hair, or to smooth the premature wrinkles on his long-nosed, thin-lipped face. He was smiling sardonically at Ellaby now, as if he could read Ellaby's mind. ""I might have known it would be you,"" he said. ""As soon as they said the assassin was coming from High Falls, I should have guessed."" ""Why?"" asked Ellaby. It was a question which had nudged for ten years at his docile patience. When people go out of their way to train you, though, to spend ten years teaching you every inch of Capitol territory without once taking you there, to make you proficient with various deadly weapons although your reflexes are splendidly modal, to teach you meaningless phrases like democratic inequality (?) and individuality (?) and the right to live a self-directed (?) life, to make your own decisions (?), when people act, in short, like a very thorough government school, even if their motives seem strangely misdirected, you don't question them. ""For two reasons,"" Mulden said. ""You can understand the first, Ellaby. If the second one bothers you, forget it. In the first place, you're so perfectly modal, the government would never suspect you. In the second place, you're so well adjusted you're bound to follow our instructions."" ""Or any instructions,"" Dorcas Sinclair said. ""That's what I'm afraid of, Mulden."" * * * * * Ellaby still couldn't get over it. He never expected to find poor, unfortunate Sam Mulden in such a high position in the organization or anywhere. He remembered Mulden clearly from their school days together. Mulden",0,
"I never thought it would come to this. Sitting here, alone in my room, I find myself reflecting on the end of our relationship. It feels like a lifetime ago that we were happy, that we were in love. The memories flood my mind, each one a dagger to my heart, reminding me of what we used to have.

The pain is unbearable at times. I go through the motions of everyday life, but inside, I am shattered. The tears come without warning, the ache in my chest a constant reminder of the void you left behind. I find solace in the darkness, in the quiet moments when I allow myself to grieve. It is here that I confront the reality of our breakup, the harsh truth that love doesn't always last.

I loved you with every fiber of my being. I gave you my heart, my trust, my everything. You were my world, my reason for waking up every morning, and now that world has crumbled beneath my feet. I find myself questioning everything, wondering where it all went wrong. Were there signs I missed? Was there something I could have done to save us?

The doubt and self-blame consume me. I dissect every moment, every word, searching for answers that may never come. But deep down, I know that it wasn't just me. Relationships are a dance, a delicate balance between two people. And somewhere along the way, we lost our rhythm.

Betrayal cuts the deepest, leaving wounds that take time to heal. It's the realization that someone you loved and trusted could hurt you so deeply. It's a bitter pill to swallow, and yet I must find a way to forgive. Not for your sake, but for mine. Carrying the weight of anger and resentment will only hold me back, will prevent me from moving on.

Closure is what I yearn for. I need to understand why you walked away, why our love wasn't enough. But perhaps closure is a myth, a fairy tale ending that only exists in movies. Perhaps the closure I seek can only come from within. I must learn to accept that sometimes, people change, and love isn't always enough to keep them together.

In this journey of healing, I have discovered a strength I never knew I possessed. It is the strength to pick up the pieces and start anew. It is the strength to love myself, despite the pain and the heartache. It is the strength to believe that someday, someone will see my worth and cherish me for who I am.

But for now, as I sit here amidst the shattered remnants of our love, I allow myself to feel. I embrace the sadness, the grief, the longing. For by feeling these emotions, I am reminded that I am alive. I am reminded that I have the capacity to love deeply, even if it means risking the agony of a broken heart.

And so, I take a deep breath and let go. I release the pain and the bitterness, allowing it to float away like a balloon caught in the wind. I'm not sure what the future holds, but I know that I am stronger for having loved you. I am wiser for having learned the lessons that heartbreak has taught me.

As I close this chapter of my life, I hold onto the hope that one day, I will find someone who will love me unconditionally, someone who will see the scars on my heart and choose to stay. Until then, I will continue to heal, to grow, and to believe that love will find its way back to me.",1,
"of to-day must always have felt suddenly boorish. She belonged to a politer age: you never knew it more surely than when she was putting you at your ease with a graciousness that had something of a command in it. Mrs Oliphant was herself the fine Scots gentlewoman she drew so incomparably in her books, most sympathetic when she unbent and a ramrod if she chose--the _grande dame_ at one moment, almost a girl, it might be, the next (her sense of fun often made her a girl again), she gave you the impression of one who loved to finger beautiful things, and always wore rare caps and fine lace as if they were part of her. She could be almost fearsomely correct, and in the middle of it become audacious (for there was a dash of the Bohemian about her); her likes and dislikes were intense; in talk she was extremely witty without trying to be so (she was often, I think, amused and surprised to hear what she had just said); her eyes were so expressive, and such a humorous gleam leapt into them when you attempted to impress her (with anything more pretentious than an umbrella), that to catch sight of them must often to the grandiloquent have been to come to an abrupt stop; and, more noticeable perhaps than anything else, she was of an intellect so alert that one wondered she ever fell asleep. That was but a first impression, a photograph of externals, little to be read in it of the beautiful soul and most heroic woman who was the real Mrs Oliphant. The last time I saw her, which was shortly before her death, I knew her better. The wit had all gone out of her eyes, though not quite from her talk; her face had grown very sweet and soft, and what had started to be the old laugh often ended pitifully. The two sons who had been so much to her were gone, and for the rest of her days she never forgot it, I think, for the length of a smile. She was less the novelist now than a pathetic figure in a novel. She was as brave as ever, but she had less self-control; and so, I suppose it was, that the more exquisite part of her, which the Scotswoman's reserve had kept hidden, came to the surface and dwelt for that last year in her face, as if to let all those who looked on Mrs Oliphant know what she was before she bade them good-bye. I wonder if there is among the younger Scottish novelists of to-day any one so foolish as to believe that he has a right to a stool near this woman, any one who has not experienced a sense of shame (and some rage at his heart) if he found that for the moment his little efforts were being taken more seriously than hers: I should like to lead the simple man by the ear down the long procession of her books. It is too long a procession, though there are so many fine figures in it--men and women and boys (the boy in 'Sir Tom' is surely among the best in fiction) in the earlier stories, nearly all women in the latest; but whether they would have been greater books had she revised one instead of beginning another is probably to be doubted. Not certainly because the best of them could not have been made better. That is obvious to almost any reader: there nearly always comes a point in Mrs Oliphant's novels where almost any writer of the younger school, without a sixth part of her capacity, could have stepped in with advantage. Often it is at the end of a fine scene, and what he would have had to tell her was that it was the end, for she seldom seemed to know. Even 'Kirsteen,' which I take to be the best, far the best, story of its kind that has come out of Scotland for the last score of years, could have been improved by the comparative duffer. Condensation, a more careful choice of words, we all learn these arts in the schools nowadays--they are natural to the spirit of the age; but Mrs Oliphant never learned them, they were contrary to her genius (as to that of some other novelists greater than she), and they would probably have trammelled her so much that the books would have lost more than they gained. We must take her as she was, believing that she knew the medium which best suited her talents, though it was not the best medium. Her short stories, of which this book is a sample, contain some of her finest work,--indeed nearly all of her deepest imaginings have appeared, as it happens, in this form. There is nothing in this volume that deserves to rank with, say, 'Old Lady Mary,' nor has it the rippling humour of the delicious 'Chronicles of Carlingford': its tale of the Fellow of his college who becomes a raving lunatic because society has discovered that his mother sells butter would be quite unworthy of inclusion were it not for the noble figure of the mother; yet the book has numberless flashes of insight, several of those women ""no longer in the first flush of youth"" of whom Mrs Oliphant wrote always with abundant sympathy, and latterly as if she loved them the best, and at least one sweet love story in ""Mademoiselle"" (Mademoiselle writes such a charming love letter, saying No, that if she had dropped it on the way to the post-office the first man who picked it up and read it would have rushed her to the registrar); and as if all this were not enough, she gives us in ""Queen Eleanor and Fair Rosamond"" as terrible and grim a picture of a man tired of fifty years of respectability as was ever written.

"Captain's Log, Day 37:

It is with a heavy heart and an uncertain mind that I make this entry into our log. The relentless grip of the pack ice has us firmly in its clutches, rendering our once mighty vessel, the Anna Maria, motionless. The bitter cold bites through the narrow cracks in our creaking wooden hull, and the howling winds serve as a constant reminder of our precarious predicament. As the doctor aboard this whaling ship, I find my duties extending beyond the realm of physical ailments, as the crew's discontent is reaching a boiling point.

Captain Harrington, a man of inscrutable character, commands our ship with a mix of authority and volatility. His once charismatic demeanor has given way to a brooding temperament, as the unyielding ice mocks his authority. The captain's unwavering determination to extract every ounce of oil from these frozen waters has pushed us deeper and deeper into danger. The crew, weary and dispirited, has begun to question his judgment, further exacerbating the volatile atmosphere aboard.

I, too, am plagued by doubts. I have watched as the once lush hunting grounds gave way to barren stretches of ice, the once abundant whales now elusive as specters in the deep. With the dwindling supplies and morale of our crew, I fear that the captain's ambitions may eventually lead us to trade our lives for whale oil.

To make matters worse, I recently bore witness to the captain's outburst towards me, an outburst that has left me shaken and confused. As the doctor, I have come to know his dark side intimately. His volatile temper and unpredictability are well-known amongst the crew, but it was never directed towards me until now. In a fit of frustration, Captain Harrington unleashed his fury upon me, accusing me of harboring doubt and spreading insubordination among the crew.

In that heated moment, I saw glimpses of a tortured soul, a captain burdened by the weight of expectations and haunted by his own ambition. It was as though his rage was born not only from the ice that ensnared us but from the depths of his own torment. I cannot help but wonder if the captain's relentless pursuit of profit is driven by a need to compensate for something lost, something he himself may not fully understand.

These thoughts weigh heavily on my mind as I tend to the physical and emotional wounds of my fellow crewmen. The ice, like a cruel mistress, shows no sign of relinquishing its grip, and the discontent amongst the crew grows with each passing day. I fear that if we do not find a way to free ourselves from this icy prison, the Anna Maria will become nothing more than a hollow vessel, swallowed by the frozen abyss.

As the doctor aboard this whaling ship, it is my duty to heal both the body and the spirit. But in this frozen wasteland, where hope seems to fade with each passing hour, I struggle to find solace for myself, let alone the crew. The pack ice has become a metaphor for our collective imprisonment, testing the limits of our resilience and sanity.

In the face of this unyielding adversity, I can only hope that Captain Harrington will find the strength to lead us out of this frozen nightmare. Perhaps his outburst towards me was merely a manifestation of the pressure he too feels, a desperate cry for control in a situation that has left us all feeling powerless. Only time will reveal whether his ambition will be our salvation or our undoing.

For now, I will continue to document our hardships, both physical and emotional. The frozen expanse stretches before us, seemingly endless, and I can't help but wonder if we will ever escape its icy grasp. As the ship's doctor, I can only do my best to keep the crew healthy and support them through this dark journey, praying that we find a path back to the open sea, where the warmth of the sun will once again grace our weary faces.",1,
"The South Lawn at the White House is an iconic and historic area located in Washington, D.C., at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. As the official residence and workplace of the President of the United States, the White House is known worldwide for its political significance and architectural grandeur. The South Lawn, situated at the back of the White House, plays a crucial role in the daily life of presidents and serves as a venue for various official ceremonies and events.

The South Lawn's history dates back to the early 19th century when it was first incorporated into the design of the White House. Architect James Hoban, who won a competition to design the presidential mansion, envisioned an expansive lawn that would complement the building's neoclassical style. Over the years, the South Lawn has undergone several transformations, reflecting the changing architectural trends and functional requirements of the presidency.

One of the most significant historical changes to the South Lawn occurred in the early 20th century under the tenure of President Theodore Roosevelt. In 1902, Roosevelt commissioned Charles F. McKim, a renowned architect, to redesign and expand the White House. As part of his plans, McKim extended the South Lawn approximately 20 feet closer to the White House, creating a more substantial outdoor space for presidential activities and public gatherings.

The South Lawn has played host to a multitude of notable features and events over the years. One of the most recognizable features is the South Portico, an elegant entrance leading from the lawn into the White House. This entrance is often used for welcoming foreign leaders and dignitaries. Another prominent feature is the Rose Garden, which was initially established by First Lady Ellen Wilson in 1913. The Rose Garden serves as a picturesque backdrop for presidential announcements, press conferences, and ceremonial events such as the annual Rose Garden Medal presentation.

The South Lawn has also witnessed numerous historic moments. One notable event that took place on the South Lawn was the signing of the Camp David Accords in 1978. President Jimmy Carter, Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin, and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat came together on the South Lawn to sign this historic peace treaty, marking a significant milestone in the Middle East peace process.

Additionally, the South Lawn has served as a venue for various recreational activities and traditions. Presidents and their families have used the lawn to play sports such as touch football, baseball, and even croquet. The annual Easter Egg Roll, a long-standing tradition dating back to 1878, takes place on the South Lawn, providing a joyful celebration for children and families each year.

Presidents have also used the South Lawn to address the nation during significant moments in history. From Franklin D. Roosevelt's fireside chats during the Great Depression to recent presidential addresses, the South Lawn has been a platform for leaders to communicate with the American people.

In recent years, the South Lawn has undergone renovations and improvements to enhance its functionality and accessibility. These changes include improved infrastructure, increased security measures, and the addition of new technology to support modern communications.

In conclusion, the South Lawn at the White House holds incredible historical and symbolic significance. Its location at the back of the White House, coupled with its stunning architecture and notable features, makes it an integral part of the presidential residence. Over the years, the South Lawn has witnessed historic events, been a venue for recreational activities, and served as a platform for presidential addresses. It is a place where tradition and history converge, representing the power and importance of the presidency in the United States.",1,
"Character 1: I really hope so. I don't know how much longer I can handle this uncertainty. It's like I'm stuck in a never-ending loop of confusion, and there's no way out.

Character 2: Have you tried doing any research on the internet? Maybe there's some historical information that could shed some light on what's happening to you.

Character 1: Oh, believe me, I've been researching like crazy. But it's like this place I'm in doesn't exist in any history books or online records. It's as if it's completely detached from our reality.

Character 2: That's mind-boggling. I can't even begin to comprehend how that's possible. But there has to be some explanation. Have you thought about talking to a professional? Maybe a psychologist or a paranormal investigator?

Character 1: I've considered it, but I'm afraid they'll just brush me off as a lunatic. Besides, how do you explain an alternate reality that no one else seems to acknowledge? It sounds so far-fetched.

Character 2: I understand your hesitation, but don't let fear hold you back. There might be someone out there who has encountered something similar or has the knowledge to understand what's happening to you. You won't know until you try.

Character 1: You're right, Morgan. I can't let fear dictate my actions. I need to be proactive and find someone who can help me unravel this mystery.

Character 2: That's the spirit! Remember, you're not alone in this. You have friends who care about you and want to support you through this ordeal. We'll be here every step of the way.

Character 1: Thank you, Morgan. Your support means the world to me. I can't express how grateful I am to have someone like you by my side.

Character 2: The feeling is mutual, my friend. We've been through thick and thin together, and this is just another challenge we'll face head-on.

Character 1: I truly appreciate your optimism. It gives me hope that there might be a resolution to all of this. Maybe one day, I'll wake up and find myself back in the reality I'm familiar with.

Character 2: And until that day comes, we'll keep searching for answers. We won't rest until we find a way to bring you back home.

Character 1: Thank you, Morgan. I couldn't ask for a better friend. Let's keep pushing forward and never give up.

Character 2: Absolutely! We'll overcome this strange experience together, no matter the odds.",1,
"The history of Christianity in the Ottoman Empire during the fifteenth to nineteenth centuries was marked by significant challenges and restrictions faced by the Orthodox Christian Church. The Ottoman Empire, which rose to power in the 15th century and lasted until the early 20th century, encompassed a vast territory that included many diverse religious and ethnic groups. While the empire was initially tolerant towards its Christian subjects, particularly the Orthodox Christians, this changed over time as the empire expanded and encountered political and religious tensions.

One of the key figures in the Orthodox Christian Church during this period was the ecumenical patriarch. The ecumenical patriarch held a position of religious and administrative power within the Orthodox Christian community. He was the leader of the Orthodox Church in the Ottoman Empire and held significant influence over the spiritual and religious affairs of the Orthodox Christians. The ecumenical patriarch was also responsible for negotiating and mediating between the Ottoman authorities and the Christian communities, which often placed him in a challenging position of maintaining the interests of his community while navigating the political landscape of the empire.

However, the ecumenical patriarch's power was not absolute, and he had to operate within the confines of the Ottoman system. The Ottoman authorities imposed various restrictions and challenges on the Christian communities. These restrictions included limitations on the construction and repair of churches, the payment of extra taxes, and restrictions on the religious practices of Christians. While the Ottomans practiced a form of religious tolerance that allowed Christians to practice their faith, they were also keen to maintain their own dominance and control over their subjects. This resulted in a complex relationship between the Christians and the Ottoman authorities.

The Ottoman Empire also saw the rise of various reform movements, including the Enlightenment, which had a profound impact on the Christian communities. The Enlightenment brought with it new ideas about reason, freedom, and individual rights that challenged the traditional religious order. This had a significant effect on the Orthodox Christian Church, as some members of the clergy and laity embraced these new ideas and sought to reform the Church in light of the changing times.

One of the key figures in this movement was Patriarch Cyril V, who served as the ecumenical patriarch from 1761 to 1763. Cyril V was influenced by the Enlightenment and sought to modernize the Orthodox Christian Church by introducing reforms in education, administration, and the relationship between the Church and the state. However, his attempts to reform the Church were met with resistance from conservative elements within the Church and the Ottoman authorities, leading to his deposition and subsequent exile.

The impact of the Enlightenment on the Orthodox Christian Church during the Ottoman Empire was mixed. While it brought about a renewed emphasis on education and intellectual discourse within the Church, it also exposed the Church to new challenges and divisions. The reforms proposed by figures like Cyril V were seen by some as a threat to the traditional religious order, leading to a conservative backlash within the Church.

Despite the challenges and restrictions faced by Christians under Ottoman rule, the Orthodox Christian Church managed to survive and maintain its presence in the empire. The Church played a crucial role in preserving the cultural and religious identity of its communities, and it served as a focal point for social, educational, and charitable activities. The ecumenical patriarch, despite the limitations on his power, continued to provide spiritual guidance and leadership to the Orthodox Christians, ensuring the survival and resilience of the Church.

In conclusion, the history of Christianity in the Ottoman Empire during the fifteenth to nineteenth centuries was a complex and challenging period for the Orthodox Christian Church. The ecumenical patriarch wielded religious and administrative power within the Orthodox Christian community, but faced restrictions and challenges imposed by the Ottoman authorities. The Enlightenment brought new ideas and challenges to the Church, with some members embracing reform and others resisting change. Despite these obstacles, the Orthodox Christian Church managed to survive and maintain its presence, playing a crucial role in preserving the cultural and religious identity of its communities.",1,
"darkness or to sudden blindness. You raise your hands gropingly before you. They touch a plain smooth surface, a wall. You spread them apart and each hand reaches a corner. You pivot slowly. A second wall, then a third, then a door. You are in a closet about four feet square. Your hand finds the knob of the door. It turns and you push the door open. There is light now. The door has opened to a lighted room ... a room that you have never seen before. * * * * * It is not large, but it is pleasantly furnished--although the furniture is of a style that is strange to you. Modesty makes you open the door cautiously the rest of the way. But the room is empty of people. You step into the room, turning to look behind you into the closet, which is now illuminated by light from the room. The closet is and is not a closet; it is the size and shape of one, but it contains nothing, not a single hook, no rod for hanging clothes, no shelf. It is an empty, blank-walled, four-by-four-foot space. You close the door to it and stand looking around the room. It is about twelve by sixteen feet. There is one door, but it is closed. There are no windows. Five pieces of furniture. Four of them you recognize--more or less. One looks like a very functional desk. One is obviously a chair ... a comfortable-looking one. There is a table, although its top is on several levels instead of only one. Another is a bed, or couch. Something shimmering is lying across it and you walk over and pick the shimmering something up and examine it. It is a garment. You are naked, so you put it on. Slippers are part way under the bed (or couch) and you slide your feet into them. They fit, and they feel warm and comfortable as nothing you have ever worn on your feet has felt. Like lamb's wool, but softer. You are dressed now. You look at the door--the only door of the room except that of the closet (closet?) from which you entered it. You walk to the door and before you try the knob, you see the small typewritten sign pasted just above it that reads: This door has a time lock set to open in one hour. For reasons you will soon understand, it is better that you do not leave this room before then. There is a letter for you on the desk. Please read it. It is not signed. You look at the desk and see that there is an envelope lying on it. You do not yet go to take that envelope from the desk and read the letter that must be in it. Why not? Because you are frightened. You see other things about the room. The lighting has no source that you can discover. It comes from nowhere. It is not indirect lighting; the ceiling and the walls are not reflecting it at all. [Illustration: Illustrated by VIDMER] They didn't have lighting like that, back where you came from. What did you mean by _back where you came from_? You close your eyes. You tell yourself: _I am Norman Hastings. I am an associate professor of mathematics at the University of Southern California. I am twenty-five years old, and this is the year nineteen hundred and fifty-four._ You open your eyes and look again. * * * * * They didn't use that style of furniture in Los Angeles--or anywhere else that you know of--in 1954. That thing over in the corner--you can't even guess what it is. So might your grandfather, at your age, have looked at a television set. You look down at yourself, at the shimmering garment that you found waiting for you. With thumb and forefinger you feel its texture. It's like nothing you've ever touched before. _I am Norman Hastings. This is nineteen hundred and fifty-four._ Suddenly you must know, and at once. You go to the desk and pick up the envelope that lies upon it. Your name is typed on the outside: _Norman Hastings_. Your hands shake a little as you open it. Do you blame them? There are several pages, typewritten. Dear Norman, it starts. You turn quickly to the end to look for the signature. It is unsigned. You turn back and start reading. ""Do not be afraid. There is nothing to fear, but much to explain. Much that you must understand before the time lock opens that door. Much that you must accept and--obey. ""You have already guessed that you are in the future--in what, to you, seems to be the future. The clothes and the room must have told you that. I planned it that way so the shock would not be too sudden, so you would realize it over the course of several minutes rather than read it here--and quite probably disbelieve what you read. ""The 'closet' from which you have just stepped is, as you have by now realized, a time machine. From it you stepped into the world of 2004. The date is April 7th, just fifty years from the time you last remember. ""You cannot return. ""I did this to you and you may hate me for it; I do not know. That is up to you to decide, but it does not matter. What does matter, and not to you alone, is another decision which you must make. I am incapable of making it. ""Who is writing this to you? I would rather not tell you just yet. By the time you have finished reading this, even though it is not signed (for I knew you would look first for a signature), I will not need to tell you who I am.

"The Panama–Pacific International Exposition held in San Francisco in 1915 was a momentous event that celebrated the completion of the Panama Canal and showcased the progress and achievements of the United States. As part of the commemoration, the United States Mint produced a series of commemorative coins known as the Panama–Pacific commemorative coins.

The Panama–Pacific commemorative coins were created to honor the exposition and the monumental construction of the Panama Canal. They were designed by Charles E. Barber, who was the Chief Engraver of the United States Mint at the time. Barber's design featured a ship sailing through the Panama Canal, with the Panama Canal Zone's official emblem, a shield symbolizing the United States' control over the canal, on the reverse side of the coin.

These coins were struck in various denominations, including half dollars, gold dollars, and $50 gold pieces. The half dollars were made of silver, while the gold dollars and $50 gold pieces were made of gold. The gold pieces were the largest and heaviest coins ever produced by the United States Mint, weighing in at approximately 2.5 ounces.

The production of these commemorative coins began in 1915, and they were available for purchase during the Panama–Pacific International Exposition. However, due to the high cost of production and the limited popularity of commemorative coins at the time, the demand for these coins was relatively low. As a result, the mintage numbers for the Panama–Pacific commemorative coins were relatively low, making them rare and highly sought after by collectors today.

One of the key individuals involved in the production and distribution of the Panama–Pacific commemorative coins was Treasury Secretary William G. McAdoo. McAdoo was a proponent of the commemorative coin program and played a pivotal role in ensuring the coins were minted and made available to the public. He believed that the coins would not only serve as a tribute to the achievements of the Panama–Pacific International Exposition but also generate revenue for the government.

Another significant figure in the story of the Panama–Pacific commemorative coins was numismatist Farran Zerbe. Zerbe was the president of the American Numismatic Association and a well-known advocate for commemorative coinage. He served as the official distributor of the Panama–Pacific commemorative coins and played a crucial role in promoting their sale and distribution to collectors and the general public.

Despite their limited mintage, the Panama–Pacific commemorative coins did not gain immediate popularity among collectors. Many were kept as souvenirs or passed down through generations, meaning that a significant number of these coins still exist today. However, due to their rarity and historical significance, these coins are highly valued by collectors and numismatists. Some of the rarest and most sought-after pieces include the $50 gold coins, which are extremely scarce and can fetch astronomical prices in the collector's market.

The history of private gold coins in the United States also adds to the allure of the Panama–Pacific commemorative coins. Private gold coins were minted by private individuals or companies during times of economic uncertainty or a shortage of legal tender. These coins often fluctuated in value and were not officially recognized by the government. However, the Panama–Pacific commemorative coins were commissioned and minted by the United States Mint, making them official government-issued coins.

In conclusion, the Panama–Pacific commemorative coins are not only beautiful pieces of numismatic art but also significant historical artifacts. They commemorate the completion of the Panama Canal and the Panama–Pacific International Exposition, an event that showcased the progress and achievements of the United States. The rarity and historical value of these coins have made them highly sought after by collectors and investors alike. Today, the Panama–Pacific commemorative coins serve as a reminder of a momentous time in American history and continue to captivate numismatists with their beauty and historical significance.",1,
"arg. A rough day. Don't you hate it when you don't know exactly what to say to someone, so you rethink what you ought to write or say about a million times in your head, and every time you stop and take stock, you realize your little mental thesis has drifted even farther from anything that might concievably convince or communicate? I also dislike being torn between furious reprisal and begging. Yeah, I tried to write something to carrie, and formatted it as a genuine and informative thing, as a snapshot of my thoughts and feelings, rather than analyzing it to death and formatting for chance of understanding and success. I keep forgetting she doesn't care about me anymore and has no inclination to read for content and correct for context. So I get a vaguely nice put-down back, and I don't know what to say in return. On one hand, I should just say what I think, and be done. I'm pretty certain I don't have much of a chance for any kind of actual friendship with her, as it is, I'm pretty much being tolerated, I think. Carrie has always felt this sense of duty to include people, despite not having much of an interest in them as people. I remember how she was so nice and inclusive and helpful to Brad, despite his issues. I don't really want or appreciate that kind of position. It sounds nice, but you end up seeing her once a month, and having to initiate and sustain all the communication that occurs, and for what? Some sense of being there? A little kick of hope every time she keeps talking to you? No thanks. On the other hand, I don't want to lose contact with her. She knows me pretty well. Probably better, in terms of details and experience than anyone. Her knowledge of me is skewed because she only saw me in my soft caring persona, only knowing me in Salt Lake City, while we were dating most of the time. So, given how well she knows me, it hurts that she seems to be so uncomfortable and disinterested in my presence, or thoughts. Is it a function of my characteristics, or hers? It almost doesn't even matter. Even supposing she had lost her mind ten seconds before I moved here(as she acted very differently back in SLC even after she left me) the judgement still hurts. She is the kind of person that I want to like me. I cared about her more than any person I've ever had a relationship with. I still care about her, even if it's poisoned with regret and loss and loneliness now. She would no doubt prefer that I provide my services as a friend, be happy in her presence, entertain, enjoy, and so on. I can understand not wanting to deal with someone else as a thinking feeling entity, who may not be in perfect synch with you. It's easier to ask them to shut up about anything you don't want them to talk about, and keep things in areas you enjoy. But that's not actually being friends with someone. It's just saying you are, and ignoring everything about them you don't like. You would think that eight months and a decision to leave a relationship behind me would deaden the emotions about a person. I probably won't ever date Carrie again. I have known this, if not quite accepted it, for a good time now. It's one of those things you have to decide to get through the blackness of loss. It's something I reconfirmed to myself time and time again, as things went on. But while that kind of decision changes your approach, the way you plan, the things you hope for, but it doesn't kill the emotions that remain. There is no bleach for the soul, that I have found. I wish that I could be as blase' as she is, and walk away from the emotions and desires that come with sharing something like that for so long. Maybe she never felt the way that I did. I liked to imagine that I could tell how she felt. That we communicated in silence. I guess this is all ancient history. It should be to me. It keeps rising up because she's here now, in front of my eyes(occasionally) when she had just disappeared after leaving me. This has been nagging in the back of my mind since yesterday. I wrote something to her last night about it, and got her reply today. I haven't replied back yet, and I don't know what to say. I've taken two long walks and a ridiculously long nap and shower, to indulge my thoughts, and haven't managed to exorcise, or come to a decision, so I turned to the last resort, the blog. It's really been occupying me more than it should, and I think I'll lay it to rest for the moment. I have other work to do, and other people to care about. Corey is out, and better, and seemingly legal-trouble free(very good). Crystal and I continue to correspond, and I wish she were out here, so that I could talk to her about it. She's been through some rough stuff in the past, and I feel like we have some commonality of interest and understanding. It's too bad that I met her when I did, otherwise, things might be happier. Talking to her long distance is very strange, I feel like I can't quite render the same connection into words and elements in emails, and she has the oddest spelling I've ever encountered. It's strangely compelling, but horrifically incorrect. It spoils much of what she says to me, until I correct it for myself. Talked to Noel not too long ago, he's still getting married, and pretty happy about it, insofar as text can communicate. I'm happy for him. I need to talk to Amanda more, get to know her",0,
"Seth Leon stood on the outskirts of the bustling city, watching as the revelers prepared for the grand festivities. His piercing gaze swept across the streets, taking in the vibrant colors and joyful laughter that filled the air. To the casual onlooker, he appeared to be just another face lost in the crowd, but Seth was anything but ordinary.

Tall and lean, with dark hair that framed a face marked by the scars of battles long fought, Seth exuded an air of mystery and danger. He was a man of few words, but his actions spoke volumes. Many whispered tales of his uncanny abilities and his involvement in secret missions that shaped the fate of nations. He was a figure shrouded in secrecy, and those who crossed his path often found themselves on the wrong end of his blade.

As Seth watched the merrymakers, a creeping sense of unease settled within him. It was a feeling he had grown accustomed to, a sixth sense that had saved his life on countless occasions. Despite the apparent joy and revelry, his intuition warned him of the ominous storm brewing just beyond the city walls.

Before he could contemplate further, a messenger appeared before him, delivering a summons from the ruler of the city. Seth's eyes narrowed, his instincts urging him to disregard the call, to retreat into the shadows and follow his own path. However, a flicker of curiosity tugged at the corners of his mind. The ruler's request was unusual, and Seth couldn't help but wonder what lay behind it.

Reluctantly, Seth made his way through the throngs of people, leaving a trail of confusion and curiosity in his wake. The townspeople, though fearful of him, couldn't help but be drawn to the enigmatic figure. Some whispered tales of his past exploits, while others trembled at the mere sight of him. Seth paid no mind to their reactions, knowing that appearances could be deceiving.

As Seth reached the grand palace, he was greeted by guards who eyed him warily. They seemed torn between awe and trepidation, unsure of what to make of this man who walked the thin line between hero and villain. With a nod, Seth followed the guards into the opulent halls, his footsteps echoing through the marble corridors.

Finally, Seth arrived in the ruler's private chambers, where an air of tension hung heavy in the air. The ruler, a middle-aged man with a crown perched precariously on his head, looked up as Seth entered. His eyes held a mixture of desperation and determination. Seth's gaze met his, and in that moment, a silent understanding passed between them.

The ruler spoke, his voice laced with urgency. ""Seth Leon, I have called upon you because I know of your unique abilities. Our city is on the brink of war, and I fear for the safety of our people. They are oblivious to the impending danger, blinded by the festivities. I need you to help me uncover the truth, to find the source of this threat.""

Seth listened intently, his instincts reaffirming the ruler's suspicions. He nodded, accepting the task laid before him. ""I will do what is necessary to protect this city and its people. Tell me what you know.""

And so, Seth Leon set out on a perilous journey, navigating the intricacies of a city on the brink of chaos. With each step, he uncovered fragments of a dark conspiracy, a web of deceit that threatened not only the city but the entire realm.

As he delved deeper into the shadows, Seth faced countless dangers and encountered allies and enemies alike. His unconventional methods, his ability to see beyond the surface, proved to be indispensable in unravelling the truth. Along the way, he found himself questioning his own motivations, his own place in a world torn apart by greed and power.

But Seth pressed on, driven by a sense of duty and an unwavering determination to protect those who could not protect themselves. He knew that the road ahead would be treacherous, that he would have to face unimaginable challenges, but he remained steadfast in his resolve.

In a world where appearances could be deceiving, Seth Leon stood as a beacon of truth, a lone figure fighting against the encroaching darkness. And as the city's festivities faded into the background, his journey continued, his destiny intertwined with the fate of the realm itself.",1,

It makes me so angry I can hardly see that the DEA felt free to come interrogate me and my house members because my business bought a solvent that was on their urlLink watch list from an independent vendor. It made my lightly unbalanced cousin-in-law go completely unstable and he can no longer work. I can not get this solvent anymore because I need special permission and would have to purchase huge quantities when I only need a few gallons a year. My business was shut down. I am not free. It makes me almost foam at the mouth to hear the garbage that is spewed from the mouth of our ""leaders"" everyday to try to cover the fact that they are a lot of lying, stealing, murderous sons-of-bitches, and the American public buys it. I have never missed a chance to vote but I am beginning to believe that it doesn't matter because (like a horse race) it is urlLink rigged anyway. I am not free. It makes me see red everytime someone is accused of being a terrorist (commie), unpatriotic, or incompetent when they speak out against government actions or policies. And the US public buys the media line and does nothing. I am not free. It makes me want to vomit everytime I see the face of ""our glorious leader"", coup de tat King George. Can't you see Cheney's hand up his ass urlLink making him speak . I am not free. It makes we want to move someplace far away whenever I look at the current face of American and realize that most people are willing slaves that put the chains on themselves. But where on this planet is far enough away to escape the long arm of ""Big Brother?"" When can we start colonizing the moon or Mars? I am not free. I am not angry about the urlLink pictures from Iraq. I expected it. I am only surprised that it took this long to get out.I have no anger left to spend on the predictable actions of our government to try to blame everyone but themselves. This is a government that does not understand freedom because it doesn't understand responsibility. To quote a favorite book of mine ""Freedom is the right to take responsibility for yourself."" I am not free. My government tells me what I can drink, eat, medicate myself with, where I can live, and what work I can do. If you don't believe me, try to be a gunsmith without a federal permit, or a therapist without a license. Try to start a business with paying the appropriate government bribes (permits and licenses] and see how long before some government thug comes to steal your belongings and shut you down. They always say it is to protect us but what if I don't want protection? What if I want freedom? What if I want to be able to shoot the mother f$#*@% that just poisoned my water? What if I want to try some unapproved medicine because it may save my life? What if I want to damage my body with something because I like the effect? You don't even have the right to kill yourself in this country. The government reserves the right to tell you if you can live or die, unless nature takes that power away from them. If they could prevent nature from causing death they would surely do it. Think of all the tax payers and wage slaves they could have if you could never die. Our government butts in where there is no real justification and mostly fails to act when there is a question of the common good. The common good dictates that our water and air not be poisoned. Have you read the "" urlLink Clear Skies "" manifesto? The common good dictates that our food supply not be contaminated. Do you know how they raise urlLink livestock , and process food? Do you read ingredient labels and understand what is urlLink actually in the food you are eating? The common good has nothing to do with some poor sot smoking crack to ease the pain of living or to hurry death. The common good does not have to do with who sleeps with whom and what they do. The common good does not have to with decisions",0,
"Alaigal Oivathillai (transl. Waves never cease) is a 1981 Indian-Tamil language coming of age Romantic film written and directed by Bharathiraja, from a story by Manivannan. The film stars two new debutants Karthik and Radha, while Thiagarajan, Silk Smitha and Kamala Kamesh appear in supporting roles. It follows Vichu (Karthik), a Hindu boy falls in love with Mary (Radha), a Christian girl. How the lovers unite braving all the obstacles, forms the crux of the story. The story and screenplay were written by Manivannan and Bharathiraja, respectively. Bharathiraja provided the voice-over for Thiagarajan, while Karthik's voice was dubbed by S. N. Surendar and Radha's voice was dubbed by Anuradha. The cinematography was handled by B. Kannan, and editing was handled by R. Bhaskaran. The music was composed by Ilaiyaraaja. The film was simultaneously shot along with its Telugu version titled Seethakoka Chilaka (1981) where Karthik reprised his role. Alaigal Oivathillai was released on 18 July 1981 to majorly positive reviews and became a blockbuster. The film received eight Tamil Nadu State Film Awards and went on to become a cult film in later years. It was also remade by Bharathiraja in Hindi as Lovers in 1983. Vichu, a laidback teenager from an orthodox Brahmin family, lives with his widowed mother, a music teacher, in a coastal village. Mary, a modernised Christian girl studying in a nearby town, returns to the village after finishing her examinations, where her wealthy brother David lives with his wife Elissy. David is ruthless, arrogant and feared by the villagers. However, he is extremely protective of his sister. Once when she sings with her friends, Vichu and his friends mock her singing skills. Feeling insulted, she decides to learn singing, obtains permission from David and enrolls in music classes under Vichu's mother. Mary soon excels and gets the appreciation of Vichu's mother. Vichu gets impressed with Mary's perseverance and when she sings a song exceedingly well, he loses his heart to her. He starts chasing her and expresses his love. Mary, however, avoids him and goes to the extent of slapping him. But the same anger turns into love when she realises his true love for her. The relationship between Vichu and Mary grows and they become very close to each other without their families knowing. Two children playing on the beach see Vichu and Mary romancing; one of them informs her mother, who in turn informs Elissy about their affair. Elissy berates Mary for courting a non-Christian and warns her of the consequences, should David learn. Elissy prevents Mary from leaving her house, instead arranging for Vichu's mother to teach her there. Vichu and Mary start exchanging messages written on paper pieces tucked in the harmonium. Despite Elissy's control, Mary manages to meet Vichu. Vichu's mother accidentally sees a note in the harmonium and cautions Vichu. However, he explains his true love and seeks her support. Mary gets admission in a city college, but her love for Vichu prompts her to adopt ingenious techniques to fall ill to enable her to get excuses to cancel the trip. Vichu's friends say the best way to resolve the matter is by proposing formally. Vichu and his friends visit David at his house and propose Vichu's marriage with Mary; David angrily refuses, beats Mary and berates Elissy for being irresponsible. He then locks up Mary and vows to stop her love affair with Vichu. During the course of events, David gets aroused by his servant Mari's wife undressing, enters the bathroom and rapes her. Elissy who sees the whole thing is too afraid to stop David and she frantically tries to divert Mari's attention to avoid exposing David and thereby shaming her family. Though he is caught in the act, David cleanly gets away due to his clout, and Mari and his wife, quietly leave the house without making a scene, after making a sarcastic comment to David that he had already 'repaid' them for their loyalty, and Elissy — rather than they — should be given the final payment for coolie services rendered, for standing 'guard' so faithfully during the shameful act. Hurt by the barbed comment but knowing she did wrong and enraged at David's lack of remorse and callousness when she confronted him about the rape, Elissy now turns against David. She decides to help Mary, who truly loves Vichu and assists Mary to meet Vichu secretly. David, who comes to know of this, decides to get Mary married to a relative in a hurry. The priest at the local church meets David and advises him to understand true love and support the young lovers, but David disagrees as he feels religion is more important than emotions. Elissy is against his plan, and advises Mary to meet Vichu and decide their future. Mary and Vichu decide not to run away, but to live in the same village. When they are together, David lands up, beats Vichu and his friends, takes Mary away and speeds up the process of her forced marriage. When Mary is determined to marry Vichu, Elissy takes her to Vichu's house and hands her over to his mother. Though Vichu's mother is apprehensive, she does not wish to abort their love and accepts Mary. However, David and his people arrive; Vichu's mother asks him and Mary to run away to a safer place. They both run away but remain at the beach. The night passes with protection from their friends. David meets the villagers and provokes them for allowing a Hindu to elope with a Christian. All the villagers join him and come to attack the lovers the next morning. Vichu and Mary notice the armed crowds coming and decide to face them. An armed David comes to attack Vichu, but is stopped by the priest who advises David to be a human and respect love. David insists that as a true Christian he will not allow Mary to marry someone of a different religion as long as she is Christian. In",0,
"Riding Pearl the mule was always an adventure. Let me tell you, she was something else! I mean, she was no Vicki, my sister's horse, but she had her own unique charm. First of all, Pearl was nothing like Vicki in terms of looks. While Vicki was sleek and muscular, Pearl was on the chunkier side. She had these big, round eyes that seemed to take up half of her face, and her fur was a mix of brown and gray. At times, she reminded me of a giant teddy bear.

But the differences didn't stop there. Vicki was like a well-trained athlete, always ready to race or jump over obstacles. But Pearl, well, let's just say she had a mind of her own. Trying to catch her in the pasture was a task in itself. While Vicki would come trotting over as soon as she saw me, Pearl would often give me this sassy look and run off, as if playing a game of tag. I had to use all my sneaky tactics, like hiding behind bushes or coaxing her with a carrot, to finally get a hold of her.

Once I had Pearl on a lead, the challenge was getting the bridle on her. She seemed to have a sixth sense about these things. The moment I tried to put the bridle over her head, she would toss her head up and back away. It was like she knew exactly what I was up to. It took a lot of patience and gentle coaxing to finally get that stubborn mule to accept the bridle. And believe me, it was a victory every time!

But the real fun began when I actually mounted Pearl. You see, Pearl had a limited repertoire of gaits. While Vicki could trot, canter, and gallop with ease, Pearl pretty much had two settings: slow and slower. It felt like we were stuck in slow motion sometimes. I would squeeze my legs and try to get her to pick up the pace, but she would just give me this side-eye as if to say, ""Nope, not happening today."" So, we would plod along at a leisurely pace, taking in the sights and sounds of the countryside.

Despite all the challenges, riding Pearl was a remarkable experience. She may not have been the fastest or most graceful ride, but she had a heart of gold. Whenever I was on her back, I felt this incredible sense of freedom. We would explore the trails and meander through the fields, just the two of us. There was something so peaceful about being in sync with her steady trot, as if time was suspended and all my worries melted away.

And it wasn't just the freedom that made riding Pearl special; it was the companionship too. Pearl was like a friend who listened without judgment. I could talk to her about anything and everything, and she would just flick her ears back and forth, as if she understood every word. There were moments when I would lean forward and rest my cheek against her warm neck, feeling this incredible connection between us.

So, yes, riding Pearl was an adventure. It wasn't always easy, and it definitely tested my patience. But there was something magical about the way she carried me through those trails, her ears swaying and her hooves hitting the ground with a steady rhythm. Pearl may have been no Vicki, but she was my partner in crime, and I wouldn't have traded those rides for anything in the world.",1,
"Kandahār (Pashto: کندھار; Kandahār, Dari: قندهار; Qandahār) is one of the thirty-four provinces of Afghanistan, located in the southern part of the country, sharing a border with Pakistan, to the south. It is surrounded by Helmand in the west, Uruzgan in the north and Zabul Province in the east. Its capital is the city of Kandahar, Afghanistan's second largest city, which is located on the Arghandab River. The greater region surrounding the province is called Loy Kandahar. The Emir of Afghanistan sends orders to Kabul from Kandahar making it the de facto capital of Afghanistan, although the main government body operates in Kabul. All meetings with the Emir take place in Kandahar, meetings excluding the Emir are in Kabul. The province contains about 18 districts, over 1,000 villages, and approximately 1,431,876 people (the 6th most populous province), which is mostly tribal and a rural society.[5] The main inhabitants of Kandahar province are the ethnic Pashtuns. They are followed by the Baloch people, Tajiks, Uzbeks, Turkmens and Hazaras.[6] There is speculation revolving around the origin of the name ""Kandahar"". It is believed to have started as one of many cities named after the Hellenistic conqueror Alexander the Great throughout his vast (mainly ex-Achaemenid) empire, its present form deriving from the Pashto rendering of Arabic Iskandariya = Ancient Alexandria (in Arachosia).[7] A temple to the deified Alexander as well as an inscription in Greek and Aramaic by the emperor Ashoka, who lived a few decades later, have been discovered in the old citadel.[8] Excavations of prehistoric sites by archaeologists such as Louis Dupree and others suggest that the region around Kandahar is one of the oldest human settlements known so far. ...Early peasant farming villages came into existence in Afghanistan ca. 5000 B.C., or 7000 years ago. Deh Morasi Ghundai, the first prehistoric site to be excavated in Afghanistan, lies 27 km (17 mi.) southwest of Kandahar (Dupree, 1951). Another Bronze Age village mound site with multiroomed mud-brick buildings dating from the same period sits nearby at Said Qala (J. Shaffer, 1970). Second millennium B.C. Bronze Age pottery, copper and bronze horse trappings and stone seals were found in the lowermost levels in the nearby cave called Shamshir Ghar (Dupree, 1950). In the Seistan, southwest of these Kandahar sites, two teams of American archaeologists discovered sites relating to the 2nd millennium B.C. (G. Dales, University Museum, University of Pennsylvania, 1969, 1971; W, Trousdale, Smithsonian Institution, 1971 – 76). Stylistically the finds from Deh Morasi and Said Qala tie in with those of pre-Indus Valley sites and with those of comparable age on the Iranian Plateau and in Central Asia, indicating cultural contacts during this very early age...[9] The area was called Arachosia and was a frequent target for conquest because of its strategic location in Asia, which connects Southern, Central and Southwest Asia. It was part of the Medes territory before falling to the Achaemenids. In 330 BC it was invaded by Alexander the Great and became part of the Seleucid Empire following his death. Later it came under the influence of the Indian emperor Ashoka, who erected a pillar there with a bilingual inscription in Greek and Aramaic. The territory was ruled by the Zunbils before Arabs of the Umayyad Caliphate arrived in the 7th century. The Arabs advanced through Sistan and conquered Sindh early in the eighth century. Elsewhere however their incursions were no more than temporary, and it was not until the rise of the Saffarid dynasty in the ninth century that the frontiers of Islam effectively reached Ghazni and Kabul. Even then a Hindu dynasty the Hindushahis, held Gandhara and eastern borders. From the tenth century onwards as Persian language and culture continued to spread into Afghanistan, the focus of power shifted to Ghazni, where a Turkic dynasty, who started by ruling the town for the Samanid dynasty of Bokhara, proceeded to create an empire in their own right. The greatest of the Ghaznavids was Mahmud, who ruled between 998 and 1030. He expelled the Hindus from Ghandhara.[10] Mahmud of Ghazni made the area part of the Ghaznavids in the 10th century, who were replaced by the Ghurids. After the destructions caused by Genghis Khan in the 13th century, the Timurids established rule and began rebuilding cities. From about 1383 until his death in 1407, Kandahar was governed by Pir Muhammad, a grandson of Timur. By the early 16th century, it fell to Babur briefly. From then on the province was controlled as their easternmost territories by the Shia Safavids, who regularly had wars with the Sunni Mughals -who ruled Qandahar as a short-lived subah (imperial province), bordering Kabul and Multan subahs, from the 1638 conquest till its loss in 1648 to the great Safavid rival- over the region, until the rise of Mir Wais Hotak in 1709. He rebelled against the Safavids and established the Hotaki dynasty which became a powerful Afghan empire until 1729 when Nader Shah declared war on the Ghilzai rulers. By 1738 the last Hotaki ruler Shah Hussain was defeated in what is now Old Kandahar. Ahmad Shah Durrani, the founding father of Afghanistan, gained control of the province in 1747 and made the city of Kandahar the capital of his new Afghan Empire. In the 1770s, the capital of the empire was transferred to Kabul. Ahmad Shah Durrani's mausoleum is located in the center of the city. British-led Indian forces occupied the province during the First Anglo-Afghan War from 1832 to 1842. They also occupied the city during the Second Anglo-Afghan War from 1878 to 1880. It remained peaceful for about 100 years until the late 1970s. During the Soviet occupation of 1979 to 1989, Kandahar province witnessed many fights between Soviet and local Mujahideen rebels. After the Soviet withdrawal the city fell to Gul Agha Sherzai, who became a powerful warlord and controlled the province. At the end of 1994, the Taliban took over the area and set out to conquer the rest of Afghanistan. Since the removal of the Taliban",0,
"I Am Not Alone Luckily, the people in my life are just as spirit prone as I am. The following stories I either witnessed or participated in or were told to me. On some, I'm sure I'm not 100% sure of all the details but I will try to be as accurate as possible. The Haint Yes, that is haint, not haunt. I refer to it as an ancient Appalachian word and possibly no one outside of Appalachia has heard this before. A haint is a banshee-like creature, mostly myth and folklore. Redneckin' Dictionary of Common Terms refers to it as an ""archiac rural for spooks, ghosts."" I stand by the opinion that it is more banshee like. My friend G.G. lived off a holler, off a holler, off a holler (that's hollow for you city folk) and before I ever came to know them, they had a haint. This haint would cry and wail at night time and stalk around their house. One night, her Uncle Jinks and her grandfather Tex rounded it up under the house and shut it up inside. She said the floorboards of their house rattled as it pitched and fought to get free. It raised quite a stink and she said every hair on her body stood at attention. It eventually fought its way free, how I'll never know, and eventually it left. Some folks believe a haint is actually your conscience. When you have a bad conscience the haint will follow you. I have a different theory of this particular haint, which I will relate next. The Indians One day I was sitting on G.G.'s porch enjoying whatever breeze would blow out of the mountains. Over a period of time, G.G's mom had been telling me about growing up in the area and how different it was now. She said G.G. should take me up past the old horse barn to where they had bulldozed to see if we could find any arrowheads as they had found a lot when it was first cut. That thought was far from my mind until I happen to look across the road and into the mountain. It wasn't the same mountain anymore. It was brushier, the road was gone and the creek ran differently. Coming down a small footpath was a tribe of indians. They walked single file carrying packs. I watched as long as I could and when I blinked the vision was gone. I realized then that the house was probably built on or very near an Indian burial ground. Certainly Indians had lived in that area as evidenced by finding all of the arrowheads. That would certainly explain, not just the haint, but the other odd occurrences that kept cropping up around there. Footsteps One night while at G.G.'s I left her bedroom and went to use the bathroom which was directly off the kitchen. G.G.'s house had wood floors that creaked so you knew when someone was up and about. I had just sat down to use the bathroom when I heard the footsteps come through the house. I figured G.G. was lying in wait to scare me. When I came out of the bathroom I looked quickly left and right. The front door was directly to my right and a countertop. Nothing. I stealthed my way through the rest of the house, checking darkened doorways to find, nothing. When I got back to the bedroom, G.G. was laying in the bed and I looked at her oddly. I asked if she had come through the house. She said no, that she thought it was me. Then we accused each other of playing a trick on the other one then decided, ""We're not alone."" She got her gun and we searched every corner of that house. Her mom was in the far back bedroom, fast asleep. Whoever it was had walked through the house behind me and then through the front door, well, without opening the door of course. That still gives me chills. I always suspected that it was Pa-Pa Tex, who had died the same year I was born. A friend helped in confirming this. The Walk-Through A girlfriend of mine in college could actually see ghosts and offered to come out to G.G.'s house to wander through and see what she could see and what energies she picked up. Needless to say, they weren't good. She described the feeling that she was not wanted there and that something very evil lurked about. She said ""the man in the kitchen"" kept watch over these spirits and kept them at bay. She described him in grey work pants, an old plaid red shirt with old black thick-framed glasses. There are no pictures of Pa-Pa Tex anywhere in that house, except photo albums, yet she described him perfectly from the pictures that I had seen. Further, Bek, had recurring dreams for most of her childhood and young adult life about the very road that we traveled and the house that G.G. lived in. She stopped having the dream about the time that G.G. and I became friends and I began traveling the road. Ivy Ivy was my big chocolate Lab who I tried to take everywhere with me. She and Bek made another trip to G.G.'s but this time they stayed in the car while I went in to get some things I had forgotten. G.G. was working out of town and happened to call while I was there. I went to stand at the kitchen door and waved to them then moved away to hang the phone up. I heard Ivy pitch a fit. She didn't normally do that when I left her sight as she was trained not to. (She was a Search and Rescue dog at the time.) When I went out to the car, Bek asked who had been there with me. I told her just me and G.G.'s mom. She asked if Uncle Jinks was there and",0,
"When I was in high school, I played football. In a small school like mine (34 people in my graduating class), if you had decent size or speed, you were automatically recruited to the football team. My high school just started their football program in 1989, 2 years before I started high school and, needless to say, we sucked. I suffered through two years of it where we went 3-6 my freshman year and 1-8 my sophomore year (we scored 3 touchdowns all year long. We rocked). After that, my coach was unceremoniously fired and this new coach was brought in. He kinda knew what he was doing. Things started looking up. His biggest change to the program was year-long weight room requirements, unless you played another sport during the year. I was decent enough in the weight room by my junior year, benching about 275 and squatting around 550, not bad for a lineman, and lifting weights, no matter how much you love it, gets ungodly and tedious after a while. So I decided to play a spring sport to break the monotony. I am perhaps the worst baseball player in the history of man, so that’s out. Linemen don’t usually translate well into playing tennis, so that’s a no-go. I love golf and all, but my typical round usually consists of building at least 2 snowmen per side (a score of 8 on one hole) and my high school has one of the best golf programs in the state, so that left the most logical choice: track (or more specifically, field. Shot put and discus). The track program at my school started my sophomore year and I took part in it, mainly because the other guys on the line were doing the same. However, we didn’t have a real throwing coach (he was along the lines of “Here’s the shot, go have fun” school of coaching), so I didn’t intend on going back. But now faced with sitting in a humid, somewhat rank weight room for 2 hours a day, the track program looked inviting. So back out to the field I went. Our coach that year decided to start taking things a little more seriously. We actually started to work on technique to make us semi-respectable. I was still struggling to reach 40 feet. It was my major goal for the year to throw 40 feet in a meet. I thought that was actually pretty good. Then we went to Bridgeton. Bridgeton High School was, hands down, the best track program in our conference and in South Jersey that year. They had the best runners, the best throwers and the best facilities I’d ever seen at a high school. By comparison, most of the meets we went to at schools had cinder tracks or sometimes asphalt. Bridgeton has one of those composite tracks that you see at D1 colleges. We get off the bus and it’s immediate intimidation. Hell, I’m sure their shoes and uniforms cost more than our hurdles and javelins. I still was feeling OK and thought that I would be able to at least place at the meet. Shot put is one of the first events of the competition, so we make our way over to the circle. We warm up a bit, and then they come over. The other team has already warmed up before, so I don’t get to see them in action before we start. I decide to slot myself as the first guy up, because I hate waiting around and just want to get it over with. I step in the circle, clear my mind and try to concentrate on my legs and hips and getting everything together in one motion. I glide across the circle and launch my first throw. It looked pretty good, but only went 38 -10. Okay, not bad , I tell myself. You have two more throws, and 39 feet may be good enough to get 3rd or steal 2nd. Then he steps in the circle. His name is Ray Wilks. I vaguely remember playing against him when we played Bridgeton in football. He was a linebacker. To look at him, he’s not much at all. Slightly taller than I was, maybe 6 feet at the most. Weight 180 soaking wet on a good day. He settles into the circle, rests the shot comfortably in the crook of his neck, and settles in. But something’s not right. He looks like he’s going to throw a discus, not a shot. Maybe he doesn’t know what event he’s in. I think about stopping him before I realize. He knows exactly what he’s doing. He spins across the circle like an Olympic shot putter and throws the 12 pound ball of steel like it’s made of Styrofoam. When it finally comes down and they measure it, 56-4, I know that I really don’t have a clue what I’m doing. Then I get a little angry. How can this little guy, who I could probably break in half on a football field, absolutely destroy me throwing a little ball like that? Doesn’t he know I can squat 550 lbs? That’s like 4 of him. After I calm down, which doesn’t take long, as my next throw goes out of bound and doesn’t count (even though it’s nowhere close to 40 feet and I’m all out-of-whack) I begin to realize. You can have all the talent/strength/knowledge/raw ability in the world. It’s the technique, stupid. Don’t try and fool yourself otherwise. I finally realized that I don’t even know what I don’t know, and that there are a million things that I’ll never begin to comprehend. I finally understood why the “favorite” (usually the guy/team that looks better on paper…the entity with the better raw stats) doesn’t always win. I learned that talent does not directly translate to success, if you don’t know the right way to apply the talent. So I tried to work on my technique as much as",0,

I.--PERSONAL.--The public has, perhaps, a right to be made acquainted with the title under which I, an unknown writer, come forward as the translator of a difficult Chinese work. In the spring of 1867 I began the study of Chinese at H.B.M.’s Legation, Peking, under an implied promise, in a despatch from the then Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, that successful efforts would be rewarded by proportionately rapid advancement in the service of which I was a member. Then followed a long novitiate of utterly uninteresting and, indeed, most repellent labour,--inseparable, however, from the acquisition of this language, which throughout its early stages demands more from sheer memory than from the exercise of any other intellectual faculty. At length, in the spring of 1877, while acting as Vice-Consul at Canton, I commenced the translation of the work here offered to the English reader. For such a task I had flattered myself into the belief that I possessed two of the requisite qualifications: an accurate knowledge of the grammatical structure of the language, and an extensive insight into the manners, customs, superstitions, and general social life of the Chinese. I had been variously stationed at Peking, Tientsin, Takow, and Taiwan Fu (in Formosa), Ningpo, Hankow, Swatow, and Canton, from the latter of which I was",0,
"The history and development of Alberta's electricity market can be traced back to the early 20th century when the province began to harness its natural resources to generate power. Initially, the electricity industry in Alberta was heavily dominated by coal-fired power plants. However, as the province's population grew and the demand for electricity increased, there was a need for diversification in the energy sources.

In the 1970s, concerns about the environmental impact of coal-fired power plants, along with the discovery of vast natural gas reserves in Alberta, led to a gradual shift towards the use of natural gas for electricity generation. Natural gas was seen as a cleaner alternative to coal, as it produced lower emissions and was more efficient. This transition was supported by the establishment of regulatory agencies to oversee the electricity market and ensure fair competition.

One of the key regulatory agencies in Alberta's electricity market is the Alberta Utilities Commission (AUC). Formed in 1913, the AUC is responsible for regulating the utility sector, including the electricity market. Its primary role is to ensure that consumers have access to reliable and affordable electricity services while promoting the development of a competitive market.

Another influential regulatory agency in Alberta's electricity market is the Alberta Electric System Operator (AESO). Established in 1996, the AESO is responsible for operating and planning the province's transmission system, ensuring the reliable supply of electricity to consumers. Additionally, the AESO is also responsible for facilitating the development of renewable energy projects in Alberta.

The early 2000s marked a significant turning point in Alberta's electricity market, as the government introduced policies to encourage the development of renewable energy sources. These policies aimed to diversify the province's energy mix and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, there was a rapid growth in renewable energy generation, primarily wind and solar power.

The Renewable Electricity Program, launched in 2017, further accelerated the growth of renewable energy in Alberta. Under this program, developers were invited to bid on long-term contracts to supply electricity from renewable sources. This initiative not only stimulated investment in renewable energy projects but also led to a decrease in the cost of renewable energy, making it more competitive with traditional forms of electricity generation.

While the transition towards natural gas and renewables has been a positive development for Alberta's electricity market in terms of environmental impact, it has also had implications for electricity prices. The cost of electricity in Alberta is influenced by various factors, including fuel prices, transmission costs, and government policies.

The shift away from coal-fired power plants towards natural gas and renewables has resulted in a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions but has also led to an increase in electricity prices. Natural gas prices are subject to market fluctuations, and the volatility in pricing has impacted the overall cost of electricity in the province.

Additionally, government policies and regulations have played a significant role in shaping electricity prices in Alberta. The introduction of a carbon pricing system, known as the carbon levy, in 2017, has added to the cost of electricity generation, which is ultimately passed on to consumers. The government has also implemented various programs to support the development of renewable energy, such as grants and subsidies. While these initiatives have contributed to the growth of renewable energy, they have also had an impact on electricity prices.

It is important to note that Alberta's electricity market is complex and influenced by a range of factors. Fluctuations in commodity prices, changes in government policies, and technological advancements all contribute to the constantly evolving landscape of the electricity market.

In conclusion, the history and development of Alberta's electricity market have seen a shift from coal to natural gas and renewables. Regulatory agencies like the AUC and the AESO have played a crucial role in overseeing the market and ensuring fair competition. Government policies aimed at promoting renewable energy have accelerated the growth of renewables, but also impacted electricity prices. The electricity market in Alberta continues to evolve, driven by the need for cleaner energy sources and the demand for affordable and reliable electricity.",1,
"The Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China is a prominent state building that serves as a venue for legislative and ceremonial activities conducted by the government of the People's Republic of China and the ruling Chinese Communist Party. Located in central Beijing's Tiananmen Square, the hall is primarily used for the full sessions of the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which take place annually in March. It also hosts the National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party every five years and the party's Central Committee meetings once a year.

Apart from its political functions, the Great Hall of the People is also utilized for various special events. It often serves as the venue for national-level meetings, anniversary celebrations, and memorial services for former leaders. It has even become a popular tourist attraction, drawing visitors from around the world who are interested in exploring Beijing's landmarks.

The construction of the Great Hall of the People began in August 1958 and was completed in September 1959 as part of the ""Ten Great Constructions"" project that commemorated the 10th Anniversary of the People's Republic of China. The design of the hall aimed to symbolize national unity and ethnic equality, reflecting the new Chinese character of the time. The building is truly impressive, spanning 171,801 square meters and featuring a length of 356 meters and a width of 206.5 meters. Its highest point reaches 46.5 meters.

The Great Hall of the People consists of three sections. The central hall, covering an area of 3,600 square meters, is particularly noteworthy. The interior of the central hall is adorned with colored marble, and 20 white marble pillars surround the space. A 12-meter-wide corridor is present on the middle floor, leading to the Great Hall of Ten Thousands. What makes the Great Hall even more intriguing is that each province, special administrative region, and autonomous region of China has its own hall within the Great Hall. These individual halls showcase unique characteristics and furnishings, providing a glimpse into the diverse cultures and traditions of China's regions.

One of the most impressive features within the Great Hall of the People is the Great Auditorium. It is China's largest auditorium, with a volume of 90,000 cubic meters. The Great Auditorium can accommodate up to 10,000 representatives and features a ceiling adorned with lights, including a prominent red star at its center. Another remarkable space within the Great Hall is the State Banquet Hall, which spans 7,000 square meters. This hall can entertain up to 7,000 guests and host up to 5,000 people for dining.

The Great Hall of the People serves as the political hub of Beijing and is home to the National People's Congress. Every year in March, it hosts the liang hui event, where both the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the National People's Congress convene for sessions lasting several weeks. The Chinese Communist Party also holds its National Congress every five years in the Great Hall. These political events demonstrate the central role that the Great Hall plays in China's governance.

In addition to its political significance, the Great Hall of the People has been used for meetings with foreign dignitaries, state funerals, and memorial services for top leaders. Notable events held at the hall include the state funerals for former leaders Liu Shaoqi, Hu Yaobang, Deng Xiaoping, and Jiang Zemin. These events underscore the historical and symbolic importance of the hall.

When not in use for official purposes, the Great Hall of the People is open to the public as a tourist attraction. Visitors can explore its grandeur and historical significance, gaining insight into China's political and cultural heritage. Additionally, the Great Hall has hosted non-political conventions and concerts, including the first Western show, Riverdance, in October 2003. The performance received an enthusiastic response from the audience, showcasing the hall's versatility as a venue for diverse events.

In conclusion, the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China stands as a significant symbol of the country's political and cultural heritage. With its grand architecture, it attracts both domestic and international visitors who are interested in exploring its historical importance. From hosting political events and meetings to accommodating cultural performances and conventions, the Great Hall of the People continues to play a vital role in shaping China's past, present, and future.",1,
"toward the sorting tubes a medium-size snowstorm consisting of the other nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine pieces of first-class mail chewed to confetti. Then, still convulsed, he snapped up a fresh ten thousand and proceeded to chomp and grind on them. Black Sorter was rugged. The rejected envelope was tongued up by Red Subsorter, who growled deep in his throat, said a very bad word, and passed it to Yellow Rerouter, who passed it to Green Rerouter, who passed it to Brown Study, who passed it to Pink Wastebasket. Unlike Black Sorter, Pink Wastebasket was very delicate, though highly intuitive--the machine equivalent of a White Russian countess. She was designed to scan in 3,137 codes, route special-delivery spacemail to interplanetary liners by messenger rocket, and distinguish 9s from upside-down 6s. Pink Wastebasket haughtily inhaled the offending envelope and almost instantly turned a bright crimson and began to tremble. After a few minutes, small atomic flames started to flicker from her mid-section. White Nursemaid Seven and Greasy Joe both received Pink Wastebasket's distress signal and got there as fast as their wheels would roll them, but the high-born machine's malady was beyond their simple skills of oilcan and electroshock. * * * * * They summoned other machine-tending-and-repairing machines, ones far more expert than themselves, but all were baffled. It was clear that Pink Wastebasket, who continued to tremble and flicker uncontrollably, was suffering from the equivalent of a major psychosis with severe psychosomatic symptoms. She spat a stream of filthy ions at Gray Psychiatrist, not recognizing her old friend. Meanwhile, the paper blizzard from Black Sorter was piling up in great drifts between the dark pillars of the sublevel, and flurries had reached Pink Wastebasket's aristocratic area. An expedition of sturdy machines, headed by two hastily summoned snowplows, was dispatched to immobilize Black Sorter at all costs. Pink Wastebasket, quivering like a demented hula dancer, was clearly approaching a crisis. Finally Gray Psychiatrist--after consulting with Green Surgeon, and even then with an irritated reluctance, as if he were calling in a witch-doctor--summoned a human being. The human being walked respectfully around Pink Wastebasket several times and then gave her a nervous little poke with a rubber-handled probe. Pink Wastebasket gently regurgitated her last snack, turned dead white, gave a last flicker and shake, and expired. Black Coroner recorded the immediate cause of death as tinkering by a human being. The human being, a bald and scrawny one named Potshelter, picked up the envelope responsible for all the trouble, stared at it incredulously, opened it with trembling fingers, scanned the contents briefly, gave a great shriek and ran off at top speed, forgetting to hop on his perambulator, which followed him making anxious clucking noises. The nearest human representative of the Solar Bureau of Investigation, a rather wooden-looking man named Krumbine, also bald, recognized Potshelter as soon as the latter burst gasping into his office, squeezing through the door while it was still dilating. The human beings whose work took them among the Top Brass, as the upper-echelon machines were sometimes referred to, formed a kind of human elite, just one big nervous family. ""Sit down, Potshelter,"" the SBI Man said. ""Hold still a second so the chair can grab you. Hitch onto the hookah and choose a tranquilizer from the tray at your elbow. Whatever deviation you've uncovered can't be that much of a danger to the planets. I imagine that when you leave this office, the Solar Battle Fleet will still be orbiting peacefully around Luna."" ""I seriously doubt that."" * * * * * Potshelter gulped a large lavender pill and took a deep breath. ""Krumbine, a letter turned up in the first-class mail this morning."" ""Great Scott!"" ""It is a letter from one person to another person."" ""Good Lord!"" ""The flow of advertising has been seriously interfered with. At a modest estimate, three hundred million pieces of expensive first-class advertising have already been chewed to rags and I'm not sure the Steel Helms--God bless 'em!--have the trouble in hand yet."" ""Judas Priest!"" ""Naturally the poor machines weren't able to cope with the letter. It was utterly outside their experience, beyond the furthest reach of their programming. It threw them into a terrible spasm. Pink Wastebasket is dead and at this very instant, if we're lucky, three police machines of the toughest blued steel are holding down Black Sorter and putting a muzzle on him."" ""Great Scott! It's incredible, Potshelter. And Pink Wastebasket dead? Take another tranquilizer, Potshelter, and hand over the tray."" Krumbine received it with trembling fingers, started to pick up a big pink pill but drew back his hand from it in sudden revulsion at its color and swallowed two blue oval ones instead. The man was obviously fighting to control himself. He said unsteadily, ""I almost never take doubles, but this news you bring--Good Lord! I seem to recall a case where someone tried to send a sound-tape through the mails, but that was before my time. Incidentally, is there any possibility that this is a letter sent by one _group_ of persons to another group? A hive or a therapy group or a social club? That would be bad enough, of course, but--"" ""No, just one single person sending to another."" Potshelter's expression set in grimly solicitous lines. ""I can see you don't quite understand, Krumbine. This is not a sound-tape, but a letter written in letters. You know, letters, characters--like books."" ""Don't mention books in this office!"" Krumbine drew himself up angrily and then slumped back. ""Excuse me, Potshelter, but I find this very difficult to face squarely. Do I understand you to say that one person has tried to use the mails to send a printed sheet of some sort to another?"" ""Worse than that. A written letter."" ""Written?

"As a librarian in a small New England town, I've had my fair share of interesting encounters with researchers and historians looking to uncover the mysteries of our rich history. So when a professor walked into our library one sunny afternoon, asking for information about a notorious mansion that had been the subject of local superstitions for decades, I couldn't help but be intrigued.

The professor, a middle-aged man with a kind smile and an air of determination, approached my desk with a stack of books and papers in his arms. He introduced himself as Professor Jameson, and explained that he was on a mission to prove that the dark past associated with the mansion was not the fault of the house itself, but rather the actions of its former inhabitants.

I must admit, I was a bit skeptical. The mansion, known as Blackwood Manor, had a long history of tragedy and misfortune. Local legends spoke of curses and hauntings, and many believed that the house itself was to blame. But Professor Jameson seemed convinced that there was more to the story, and he was determined to uncover the truth.

As we delved into the research together, I couldn't help but be impressed by the professor's dedication and knowledge. He had studied countless historical documents, newspaper articles, and even personal journals to piece together the history of the mansion and its former residents. Though I still had my doubts about his theory, I admired his commitment to finding the truth.

Over the course of several weeks, we spent countless hours pouring over dusty old books and manuscripts. I shared with him the local stories and superstitions that had been passed down through generations, while he shared with me his theories and findings. It was a fascinating exchange of knowledge and ideas.

While I remained skeptical of Professor Jameson's theory, I couldn't deny the evidence he presented. He had discovered that the mansion had a long history of tragic events, but upon closer examination, it became clear that these events were not the result of some supernatural curse, but rather the actions of the people who had lived there.

We discovered that one former resident, a wealthy businessman named Jonathan Blackwood, had been involved in a series of illegal activities that eventually led to his downfall. Another resident, a young woman named Emily Sinclair, had fallen victim to an elaborate con orchestrated by her own family. It was a web of deceit and tragedy that spanned generations, and had nothing to do with the house itself.

As our research progressed, I found myself becoming more open to the professor's theory. It was difficult to ignore the overwhelming evidence that pointed to the mansion as a mere backdrop for the actions of its inhabitants. The tragedy and misfortune were the result of human actions, not supernatural forces.

In the end, I agreed to assist Professor Jameson in his research. While I still held on to some of my skepticism, I respected his passion and dedication to uncovering the truth. Together, we combed through countless archives, interviewed locals, and pieced together the puzzle of Blackwood Manor.

Our findings were eventually published in a local historical journal, shedding new light on the infamous mansion and challenging the long-held superstitions surrounding it. While some residents of the town remained steadfast in their belief in the supernatural, others were open to the idea that perhaps the house itself was not to blame for its dark past.

Working with Professor Jameson was a rewarding experience that reminded me of the importance of questioning our own beliefs and seeking evidence to support or challenge them. It also highlighted the value of collaboration and the power of research in uncovering the truth.

As a librarian, I am privileged to be a custodian of knowledge and to assist researchers like Professor Jameson in their quest for the truth. It is through these partnerships that we can challenge long-held beliefs, shed new light on old legends, and contribute to a deeper understanding of our shared history.",1,
"Hurray!!! It’s finally done. My first piece of written work and in a couple of minutes (assuming I finish this piece in the first place) it would get posted onto RÊVES INFINIS . Now why my blog is named the way it has been, is quite a story in itself and considering that I hope (beyond my wildest expectations) to keep writing and fill my blog with unparallel idiocy, it’s quite certain that this story also can be told one day. Now coming back to the tale at hand; the intent earlier was to name this piece ‘Why did I finally start Blogging’, but repeated attempts to get myself onto typing a few words of self presumed wisdom brought about one absolute self discovery; the fact that I have never tried doing a ‘thing’, just because a lot others were doing it. Sound confusing? No, No, let me clarify…. when we try looking at it closely, it’s not all that confusing; what it rather turns out to be is a simple case of utter stupidity! From time immemorial (which in my case has to be 1978 or a couple of years later when I started making sense of things), I have always distanced myself as far a possible from the most popular (read fashionable) of the worldly pleasures our earthly kinfolks have invented. Without delving deeply into what happened years ago, let me list out a recent few…… The whole world went Potter crazy; The adventures of the extremely lovable witches wizards with the amazingly dim-witted muggles became an international hit catapulting poor little Mrs. Rowling from a one bedroom studio apartment into a Scottish castle and a new husband in tow. But for good old yours truly, Harry potter was just a fad, something to indulge in for those who had absolutely nothing else to do. The fact that every single Enid Blyton in sight was gobbled up as a kid, was something that was conveniently forgotten. And then when somebody did ask the question – “How did you find the Order of the Phoenix”? The reply was quite instant – “Harry Potter…… Who me??? Noooo Waaaay”. Though I never had to explain the reason for such an answer (probably my good friend never cared about the reason), my answer quite certainly sent the message that I was not to be considered one in the same pedestal as all those million poor souls who missed a beat in their heart on learning how Mrs. Mr. Potter were brutally killed by Lord Voldemort. A few years earlier; everybody I knew spent all their time (and almost all their pocket money) at a place with a very droll name ‘Cyber Café’. Now only heavens know why it was so mandatory to serve tasteless coffee when hundreds of college going teenagers paid through their nose(and waited with folded hands) as websites with crudely morphed pictures of some very popular actresses (and actors) came alive on the screens of Pentium machines, in closed cubicles of these cafés. It was also quite fashionable to own a free e-mail account (mostly hotmail), as it certainly added a few points in the ‘status quotient’ of an individual. And then one dear chum dared ask the question – “Hey dude what’s your e-mail id”? The reply did not require me to bat an eyelid – “Internet… Who me???? Noooo Waaaay”. Though my dear friend probably just wanted to send me a mail with a greeting message and questions on how I was doing (how very convenient!!!, considering we stayed in the adjacent rooms at the campus hostel), my answer certainly sent the message that I was not someone who would waste time at a stuffy 3’ X 3’ cubicle helping some industrious businessman mint money. The list could continue; Playing Computer Games…., Internet Chatting….., Watching WWF (as a kid)…….; However considering that I have already wasted quite a lot of our time and a tiny bit of space on blogspot’s server, let me leap into the latest of my adversary. Already having a cult following the world over, Blogging has certainly become a huge data source by itself. From writings on anything, everything, anybody and everybody to absolute useless personal stories (yes, yes I know this is one of them), blogsites are filled with information we could all want. The fact that it is written mostly by ordinary people definitely gives it an added personal touch. Then why do I hate Blogging? I guess it’s just because blogging has suddenly become outrageously popular. A lot of people I know started blogging (and more irritatingly talking in lengths about how much fun they were having writing their minds out) and this suddenly put me onto the “Noooo Waaaay” mode. Then what is it that has made this amazingly coooool anti-popularity icon (well I guess that’s what I think I’m) fall prey to something that’s becoming a rage with any and every head that spends a decent amount of time on the internet????? Trust me; I have not the faintest idea myself. That’s exactly why I had to change the title of my first ever post on a blog site. Well don’t blame me if you have been let down by the ending after being forced to expect a wonderful story on self realization and the need to change into a more intelligent being, all through these ramblings. Could it be that I have suddenly become a lot more mature, not worried about being a silly trend follower or has the world suddenly become a lot better for a normal completely sane individual like me. Well I guess; With all those time spent playing computer games chatting……. Realizing how paranoid I get if my mail box is not checked every 15 minutes….. Frantically waiting for the next Harry Potter to come out (that too after lapping each one of the first five word by word)……. I must have finally learnt to say the following 2 words, when asked if",0,
"Title: The Battle of Ferozeshah: Clash of Empires in the First Anglo-Sikh War

Introduction:

The Battle of Ferozeshah, fought between the Sikh Empire and the British East India Company, remains a significant chapter in the history of the Indian subcontinent. This clash, which took place from December 21 to 23, 1845, was a pivotal moment in the First Anglo-Sikh War. In this article, we will delve into the details of this battle, exploring the key players, strategies employed, and the outcomes that ultimately shaped the trajectory of British rule in India.

Key Players:

The battle pitted the formidable Sikh Empire, led by their courageous and capable commander-in-chief, General Lal Singh, against the British East India Company. On the British side, the main command was entrusted to Sir Hugh Gough, an experienced military leader who had already achieved success in several campaigns in India. Under Gough's command, distinguished officers such as Sir Harry Smith, Sir Henry Hardinge, and Sir John McCaskill played crucial roles in the battle.

Strategies:

General Lal Singh, aware of the British forces' superior artillery, devised a plan to engage the enemy in close combat to neutralize their firepower advantage. The Sikhs constructed a deep trench-like entrenchment, emulating the successful tactics employed by the Marathas in previous battles. This defensive entrenchment, running for about two miles, comprised a series of interconnected well-defended fortifications.

Gough, on the other hand, sought to exploit his numerical advantage and the superior British artillery. The British forces, consisting of both British and Indian soldiers, were well-trained and disciplined. Gough decided to attack the Sikh positions head-on, aiming to breach the enemy's defenses and overpower them through sheer force.

The Battle:

On December 21, 1845, the British forces launched their assault on the Sikh positions. The initial British attacks faced heavy resistance, as the Sikh defenses proved exceptionally resilient. The entrenched Sikh soldiers unleashed a barrage of musket fire, causing significant casualties among the British ranks. However, the British persisted, using their artillery to pound the Sikh positions relentlessly.

The Sikh soldiers, known for their bravery and tenacity, fought valiantly, launching counter-attacks to repel the British advances. The intense fighting continued throughout the day and well into the night. The British soldiers faced a formidable foe, but they remained determined and pressed forward, inch by inch, gradually gaining ground.

By the morning of December 22, the British had managed to breach the Sikh defenses, breaking through the entrenchments. This breakthrough necessitated a shift in tactics, as the battle transitioned from a defensive confrontation to a more mobile engagement on the open field.

Outcomes:

The Battle of Ferozeshah proved to be a fiercely fought encounter, resulting in heavy losses on both sides. The British forces, although they had managed to break through the Sikh defenses, suffered heavily. The Sikh warriors, renowned for their martial prowess, fought with exceptional bravery, inflicting significant casualties on the British ranks and demonstrating their resilience.

Despite their initial success, the British forces were unable to decisively defeat the Sikhs, who managed to regroup and continue their resistance. Ultimately, the battle ended inconclusively, with both sides claiming victory. However, the British were able to claim a strategic advantage due to their breakthrough, which allowed them to maintain pressure on the Sikh Empire in subsequent battles.

The Battle of Ferozeshah had far-reaching consequences. The British East India Company recognized the strength and resilience of the Sikh Empire and realized that the conflict would be protracted and costly. As a result, negotiations for peace were initiated, leading to the Treaty of Lahore in 1846, which marked the end of the First Anglo-Sikh War.

Conclusion:

The Battle of Ferozeshah stands as a testament to the bravery and determination exhibited by both sides. The Sikh Empire, under the leadership of General Lal Singh, put up a formidable defense against the better-equipped British forces. The battle showcased the successes and limitations of military strategies employed by each side, ultimately leading to a prolonged conflict.

This clash between the Sikh Empire and the British East India Company would shape the future of the Indian subcontinent, setting the stage for further conflicts and, ultimately, the establishment of British colonial rule. The Battle of Ferozeshah serves as a potent reminder of the complex and tumultuous history of the region, leaving a lasting impact on the collective memory of both the Sikh and British communities.",1,
"would happen to break the monotony. Now leave me the hell alone or I'll put you on report."" ""Now look here,"" Hansen began, practically beside himself with frustration, ""I saw that emergency light go on. Maybe it was activated automatically when something went out of order on your ship."" ""I don't allow emergencies on the Euclid Queen,"" said Fromer with growing anger. ""Now, if you don't--"" Hansen spared himself the indignity of being cut off. He broke contact himself. He sighed, reached for a book entitled _Emergency Procedure Rules_, and settled back in his chair. Fifteen minutes later the emergency light flashed on for the second time in two hundred years. With its red glow illuminating his freckled excited face, Hansen triumphantly placed another call to the Euclid Queen. ""This is Hansen on 43.4SC. Let me speak to Captain Fromer, please."" ""Er--the Captain has asked me to contact you. I'm the navigator. I was just about to call you. We have a small problem that--"" ""I'll speak to the Captain,"" Hansen repeated grimly. ""Now see here. I'm perfectly capable of handling this situation. Actually, it's hardly even an emergency. You were, it seems, signaled automatically when--"" ""If you'll check your emergency procedures,"" Hansen said, holding his thumb in the Rule Book, ""you'll note that the Relay Station Attendant contacts the Captain personally during all emergencies. Of course, if you want to violate--"" ""Look, old man,"" said the navigator, now sounding on the verge of tears, ""try to realize the spot I'm in. Fromer has ordered me to handle this thing without his assistance. He seems to feel that you have a grudge of some kind--"" ""If you don't put me in touch with Captain Fromer in five minutes, I'll put through a call to Sector Headquarters."" Hansen signaled off contact. If he knew nothing else about the situation, he knew that he had the upper hand. * * * * * Five minutes later Captain Fromer called him back. ""I am calling in accordance with emergency procedures,"" Fromer said between clinched teeth. ""The situation is this: We are reporting an emergency--"" ""What class emergency?"" Hansen interrupted. ""Class?"" asked Fromer, obviously caught off guard. ""Yes, Captain. There are three classes of emergencies. Major class, which would include death and injury. Mechanical class, including malfunction of Hegler units and such. And General class--"" ""Yes, yes, of course, General class by all means,"" Fromer said hurriedly. ""You see, it's hardly even an emergency. We--"" ""Just what is the nature of the trouble, Captain?"" ""Why, uh, well it seems that we were doing a preliminary landing procedure check, and ..."" ""Yes, go on."" ""Why, er, it seems that we can't get the door open."" It was Hansen's turn to be taken aback. ""You're pulling my leg, sir."" ""I most certainly am not,"" Captain Fromer said emphatically. ""You really mean that you can't open the door?"" ""I'm afraid so. Something's wrong with the mechanism. Our technical staff has never encountered a problem like this, and they advise me that any attempt at repair might possibly result in the opposite situation."" ""You mean not being able to get the door closed?"" ""Precisely. In other words, we can't land."" ""I see. Then I'm afraid there's nothing I can do except advise Sector Headquarters to send an emergency repair crew."" Captain Fromer sighed. ""I'm afraid so, too. How long will it take for a message to get there with your transmitting equipment?"" ""Two days, Captain. At a guess, there'll be a ship alongside within the week. You'll be maintaining your present position, I assume?"" ""Oh, we'll be here, all right,"" Fromer said bitterly. Then he cut contact. * * * * * As the single occupant of a large asteroid with nothing but time and boredom on his hands, Hansen was enjoying the whole situation immensely. He allowed himself the luxury of several dozen fantasies in which his name was mentioned prominently in galaxy-wide reports of the episode. He imagined that Captain Fromer was also creating vivid accounts--of quite another sort--that would soon be amusing several hundred billion news-hungry citizens of the Federation. When the repair ship arrived, it came, to Hansen's astonishment, to the asteroid, and not alongside Fromer's ship. He soon found out that there was someone else who shared the Captain's embarrassment. ""I'm Bullard,"" said a tall, thin, mournful man. ""Mind if I sit?"" ""Help yourself,"" Hansen waved a hand toward the meager accommodations. He had no idea why a Senior Engineer was being so deferential, but he enjoyed the feeling of power. ""You're probably wondering about a lot of things,"" Bullard began sadly. ""Frankly, we don't have any ideas about how we can fix Captain Fromer's door."" He waited to let that sink in. Then he continued: ""It took us three days back at the base to find out that when these ships were built, almost five hundred years ago, nobody bothered to include detail drawings of the door mechanism."" ""But why? You certainly know how to build--"" ""We know how to build Star Class ships, sure. We've built a few in the past century or two. There's never been need for replacement, really. These ships are designed to last forever. The original fleet was conceived to fill the System's needs for a full thousand years."" ""But the doors on the few ships that have been built. How--"" ""The ship's we've built were exact duplicates of Captain Fromer's ship--except for the door."" Bullard's long face radiated despair. ""No one ever questioned why the door mechanism wasn't included in the original plans. We simply designed another type--a different type--of door."" ""Well, you certainly can find out how this particular door works, can't you?"" ""I hope so,"" Bullard said, wringing his hands. ""But we have a couple of other problems. Number one, Captain Fromer has an extremely important passenger aboard. None other than His Exalted Excellency, R'thagna Bar. He is--or was--on his way home after concluding a treaty of friendship with the President of the Federation.""",0,
"In a small village nestled amidst rolling green hills, lived a humble peasant named Tomas. He toiled day and night, working the land that had been passed down through generations. Life was simple, but contentment resided in Tomas' heart as he found joy in the simple pleasures of his rural existence.

One Sunday morning, Tomas made his way to the village church. The sound of the church bells echoed through the air, calling the faithful to worship. As he entered the ancient stone building, the scent of incense filled his nostrils, and he took a seat among the congregation. At the front of the church stood Father Michael, the village priest, his kind eyes and warm smile inviting comfort and solace.

Over the years, Tomas developed a deep reverence for Father Michael. He admired the priest's unwavering faith and listened intently to his sermons, finding guidance and wisdom within his words. Father Michael, in turn, recognized Tomas' sincerity and dedication, often seeking him out for advice.

One significant event that marked a turning point in their relationship was when Tomas and his wife, Anna, welcomed their first child into the world. Overwhelmed with joy and a sense of responsibility, Tomas yearned for the baptism of his newborn. He approached Father Michael, his heart brimming with anticipation.

""Father, I wish to have my child baptized. I want to ensure that she is welcomed into the embrace of God,"" Tomas pleaded earnestly.

Father Michael, touched by Tomas' devotion, agreed without hesitation. Together, they organized a small ceremony, and as the holy water touched the baby's forehead, a sacred bond formed between the priest, the child, and her parents.

As the years went by, Tomas encountered the hardships that often befall those living off the land. Droughts parched the earth, and pests ravaged his crops. Yet, through it all, he turned to his faith, finding solace in the teachings of Father Michael. The priest became a pillar of strength, offering prayers and guidance during times of hardship.

One fateful day, tragedy struck the village. A terrible storm ravaged the countryside, destroying homes and livelihoods. Amidst the chaos, Tomas' entire house collapsed, leaving him and his family homeless. Distraught and weary, Tomas sought Father Michael's counsel.

""Father, I am lost. My house is gone, and my family is left with nothing. How can I find hope in these dire circumstances?"" Tomas asked, his voice trembling with despair.

Father Michael placed a comforting hand on Tomas' shoulder, offering kind words of reassurance. Together, they rallied the community, rebuilding not only Tomas' home but the spirits of all those affected by the storm.

Years passed, and Tomas' life took an unexpected turn. His beloved Anna fell gravely ill, leaving Tomas heartbroken and desperate. He turned to Father Michael for guidance and solace, his faith wavering under the weight of the impending loss.

""Father, why does God allow such suffering? I pray, but Anna's condition only worsens. I fear I will lose her,"" Tomas confessed, his voice breaking with sorrow.

The priest, grief evident in his eyes, embraced Tomas. He spoke of the mysteries of life, assuring him that even in the darkest of hours, faith could provide peace and acceptance. As Anna's health continued to decline, Father Michael stood by Tomas' side, offering prayers and spiritual comfort until her passing.

In the aftermath of Anna's death, Tomas' world became shrouded in darkness. Grief consumed him, leaving him questioning the very foundation of his faith. Doubts overshadowed his once unwavering belief in the divine.

Father Michael, understanding the depths of Tomas' pain, offered words of compassion. He assured him that doubt was a natural part of the journey and that even the strongest of believers questioned at times. Their bond of friendship deepened as they shared their grief, finding solace in their shared experiences.

With Father Michael's guidance, Tomas slowly regained his faith. He found strength in the memories of Anna, dedicating himself to honoring her through acts of kindness and compassion. Father Michael stood by his side, encouraging him every step of the way.

As the years went by, Tomas continued to turn to Father Michael for guidance, comfort, and strength during significant events in his life. The priest remained a steadfast presence, offering counsel and encouragement. Whether it was the joyous celebration of his daughter's wedding or the sorrowful farewell at his father's graveside, Father Michael was always there, ready to support Tomas in both his triumphs and trials.

Their relationship, nurtured through faith and shared experiences, grew into a lasting friendship. Tomas will forever be grateful for the wise counsel, unwavering support, and profound understanding Father Michael provided throughout the significant events of his life. Their bond is a testament to the power of faith and the profound impact a humble peasant and a dedicated priest can have on each other's lives.",1,
"Size is a fundamental concept that permeates our understanding of the world around us. From the dimensions of everyday objects to the vastness of the universe, size plays a significant role in how we perceive and interact with our environment. This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of size, covering its definition, measurement, human perception, and its application in various fields.

In its simplest form, size refers to the physical dimensions or extent of an object or entity. It can be measured in terms of length, width, and height, or in the case of more complex objects, through additional parameters such as depth, diameter, or volume. The units of measurement may vary depending on the context, ranging from millimeters for small scale objects to kilometers for large-scale distances.

Measuring size accurately is crucial for many practical purposes. In construction, for example, precise dimensions are required for constructing buildings and infrastructure. Similarly, in manufacturing, knowing the size of components is essential for ensuring proper fit and functionality. In medicine, accurate measurements of various body parts are crucial for diagnosis and treatment. In each of these cases, measurements rely on standardized units and instruments, such as rulers, calipers, or laser-based scanning devices.

However, size is not limited to physical dimensions alone. It also encompasses the concept of mass. Mass refers to the amount of matter present in an object and is typically measured in units such as kilograms or pounds. Unlike size, which can be altered by changing an object's shape, mass remains constant regardless of its shape or dimensions. Understanding the relationship between size and mass is essential in determining an object's weight and in the study of mechanics, where it plays a crucial role in calculations such as force and momentum.

Human perception of size is complex and can vary depending on several factors. One such factor is the observer's distance from the object. When viewing an object from a far distance, it may appear smaller than it actually is. Conversely, when viewing an object up close, it may appear larger. This phenomenon, known as the size-distance relationship, is a result of the human visual system's ability to judge an object's size based on its perceived distance.

Additionally, our perception of size can be influenced by factors such as lighting, context, and visual cues. For example, an object surrounded by smaller objects may appear larger in comparison. Similarly, lighting conditions, such as shadows, can create an illusion of size. These perceptual cues allow us to make judgments about the size of objects relative to our own bodies or familiar reference points.

Size is also a crucial consideration in various fields, from fashion to architecture to astronomy. In the fashion industry, standardized clothing sizes help ensure that garments fit customers properly. Door frame dimensions are standardized to allow for the smooth functioning of doors and ease of movement for people and objects. In astronomy, size becomes truly mind-boggling, as we explore the immense scale of celestial bodies and the vastness of the universe. Understanding the size and magnitude of stars, galaxies, and cosmic phenomena helps us unravel the mysteries of the universe.

In mathematics, size is often represented by the concept of magnitude. Magnitude refers to the relative size or quantity of a mathematical object, such as a number or vector. It allows us to compare and order objects based on their size. For example, in the number line, larger numbers have a greater magnitude than smaller ones. Magnitude is a fundamental concept in various branches of mathematics, such as algebra and calculus, and is crucial for solving equations, analyzing data, and understanding mathematical relationships.

In conclusion, size is a multidimensional concept that encompasses physical dimensions, mass, human perception, and mathematical magnitude. It is an essential consideration in fields ranging from construction and manufacturing to fashion and astronomy. Understanding and measuring size accurately is crucial for practical purposes, while our perception of size is influenced by various factors. Size plays a fundamental role in our understanding of the world, allowing us to navigate and interact with our environment effectively.",1,
"Michael stood at the edge of the seclusion he had known his entire life, his heart pounding with a mix of fear and excitement. He had grown up in a secluded religious community, where the outside world was seen as a sinful and dangerous place. But now, at the age of twenty-one, he had made the tough decision to leave this sheltered life behind and step into the unknown.

As he walked through the gates of the community, he couldn't help but feel a sense of awe and wonder. The world outside was a stark contrast to the simplicity and uniformity he had known. Tall buildings towered above him, their windows reflecting the vibrant colors of the bustling city. People hurried past him, their faces absorbed in their own lives. The noise, the lights, the sheer magnitude of it all overwhelmed him.

His first challenge was finding a place to stay. In the community, everyone lived together, sharing everything they had. But here, he had to find his own home. The apartment he found was small and modest, but it was his. It was his first taste of independence, of having a space to call his own. He slowly filled it with his few possessions, making it feel more like a home with each passing day.

The next hurdle was learning the ways of the outside world. Simple tasks such as grocery shopping or taking public transportation were overwhelming at first. There seemed to be unwritten rules and expectations that everyone else knew and followed effortlessly. Michael felt like an outsider, an alien in this new universe.

He decided to enroll in a community college to further his education and broaden his understanding of the world. It was here that he began to meet people from various walks of life, each with their own unique stories and experiences. He listened intently as they spoke of their ambitions, their dreams, and their struggles. He realized that his upbringing had shielded him from the complexities of the world, but it had also limited his perspective and understanding.

In his classes, Michael studied sociology, psychology, and philosophy, eager to learn more about the human condition and the ways in which societies functioned. He devoured books and articles, hungry for knowledge and understanding. The more he learned, the more he questioned the teachings of his religious community. He began to see the gaps in their beliefs and the rigidity of their practices.

As he became more immersed in the outside world and its ideologies, Michael found himself torn between his past and his present. He wrestled with guilt and doubt, feeling like he was betraying the community that had raised him. But he also felt a sense of liberation, a newfound freedom to explore his own beliefs and values.

One of the most striking differences he noticed was the diversity of relationships and the acceptance of different sexual orientations. In his community, love was confined to heterosexual relationships within the bounds of marriage. But in the outside world, he saw same-sex couples holding hands, expressing their love openly and without fear. It was a revelation that challenged everything he had been taught.

Navigating the dating scene was a whole other adventure. In the community, courtship was rigid and closely monitored. But here, he had the freedom to explore his own desires and preferences. He went on dates, experiencing the thrill and uncertainty of new connections. He had his heart broken and he broke hearts in return. It was a rollercoaster of emotions, but he wouldn't trade it for anything.

Through these experiences, Michael learned the value of individuality and self-expression. He realized that societal norms were not necessarily universal truths, but constructs that varied from culture to culture. He embraced his newfound freedom, but he also knew that he had a responsibility to advocate for change within his community.

As he continued his journey, Michael encountered many obstacles and made countless mistakes. But he also found acceptance, friendship, and love in unexpected places. He learned that the world was not as sinister as he had been led to believe. Yes, there were dark corners and injustices, but there was also beauty and resilience.

With time, Michael found a way to reconcile his past and his present, embracing the values he had learned in the outside world while still respecting the traditions and beliefs that had shaped him. He became a bridge between two worlds, using his experiences to promote understanding and acceptance.

His transition from a secluded religious community to the outside world was not easy, but it was a journey of self-discovery and growth. Michael emerged as a compassionate and open-minded individual, ready to embrace the challenges and opportunities that lay ahead.",1,
"Charles Everett Lively (March 6, 1887 – May 28, 1962) was an American private detective who worked as a labor spy for the Baldwin–Felts Detective Agency. He played an active role in the Coal Wars in Appalachia and Colorado during the early 20th century. Lively spied on the United Mine Workers of America in West Virginia and five other states, sometimes while working as a coal miner. After fatally shooting a striking miner during the Colorado Coalfield War, Lively spent several years working for Baldwin–Felts in the Great Plains before his assignment in Matewan, West Virginia. Lively was so successful posing as a UMWA activist that he became a union delegate and was once photographed with Mother Jones. His cover was abandoned in the wake of the Battle of Matewan in May 1920, in which seven Baldwin–Felts detectives were killed. The following year, Lively and another Baldwin–Felts operative killed Sid Hatfield, Matewan's pro-union police chief, and his associate Edward Chambers, apparently at the behest of the detective agency. Lively successfully claimed self-defense in the double homicide. His participation in three killings, with scant consequences, cemented his reputation as one of the most violent opponents of efforts to unionize the coal fields. He has been called ""the deadliest man in the West Virginia-Colorado coal mine wars"".[1] Lively was born on March 6, 1887, in Spring Hill, West Virginia, one of 11 children born to James Joseph Lively and Amelia Parsons. His father was a farmer who struggled to make a living, and his mother was illiterate. The 1900 census shows his name as ""Everett Lively"", and it is unclear if his birth name was ""Charles"". It is possible that name was added as an alias after he began work undercover in the coal fields. He then began calling himself ""Charles Everett Lively"" by 1940.[2] Lively began working as a coal miner at the age of 13, doing ""most anything about a mine—loading coal, running a machine"".[3] As a youth he was ""friendly and persuasive"", and became close to Fred Mooney, a future leader of District 17 of the United Mine Workers of America.[4] Lively joined the United Mine Workers of America in Kanawha County, West Virginia, in 1902, and remained in the union even after his work began with the Baldwin–Felts Detective Agency. He testified before Congress that he joined the detective agency in late 1912 or early 1913 in Fayette County, West Virginia.[5][3] However, the 1910 census indicates that he was in El Paso County, Colorado, employed in coal mines there. Since miners had little mobility at the time due to their poverty, it is entirely possible that he began work with Baldwin-Felts two years earlier than stated in his testimony.[6] Newspaper accounts indicate that Lively obtained employment in Colorado at the Pike's View mine in 1910, and was seriously injured there.[7] In 1913, he attended a UMWA convention as a delegate, representing the local in Gatewood, West Virginia. In addition to his mining pay, his initial salary from Baldwin-Felts was $75 a month plus expenses.[3] Sometime after 1910, Lively became active in the Western Federation of Miners, initially as a union organizer before becoming its president. After returning to West Virginia, he was sent to Huerfano County, Colorado,[8] assigned to infiltrate the UMWA local in La Veta, Colorado, and investigate a murder committed by union men. He did so successfully, using the name Everett Lively, and became vice-president of the local while working as a detective. He obtained evidence that led to the murder arrest of Jonathan Flockheart, who was secretary of the local.[9][3][10] In 1914, during the Colorado Coalfield War, Lively fatally shot a striking miner, a Swedish immigrant named Swan Oleen, in a saloon in La Veta. Lively claimed that the shooting was in self-defense. According to his biographer R.G. Yoho, it is likely that Lively killed Oleen deliberately, perhaps because of Oleen's union activities, and that he did so in order to infiltrate the Huerfano County jail. While in jail, as Everett Lively, he gathered information on union activities for the detective agency. At the behest of Albert Felts, co-owner of the agency, Lively's stay in the jail was extended to 16 months for information-gathering purposes. Lively's activities in the jail were probably conducted with the knowledge of the county sheriff, who was anti-union.[3][10][11] Lively subsequently pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter, and was sentenced to ten days in jail, with credit for time served. He was freed and ordered to leave Colorado, a decision that was necessary for his protection after the union became aware that he was a spy.[12] After leaving Colorado in 1915, he worked for Baldwin-Felts in Missouri for about a year, and then was assigned to Oklahoma, Kansas and Illinois, where he was located in 1917. His work in those regions is not known due to destruction of the agency's records in future years.[13] Lively returned to West Virginia in January or February 1920. Posing as a coal miner, he investigated the robbery of a company store and the burning of coal mining equipment. While engaged in those probes, Lively became known as a union sympathizer, for which he was fired. This firing only enhanced his reputation with union coal miners. After his firing, he was assigned to Williamson, Merrimac and then to Matewan in Mingo County, West Virginia, a scene of labor unrest, drawing a salary of $225 a month plus expenses from Baldwin-Felts.[14][3] In West Virginia he became an active member of the union, and became involved in organizing meetings, swearing in new members and planning strategies. At one point he posed with a photo that included other union activists and Mother Jones. He became widely viewed by union members as a future union leader.[15] Lively became the operator of a restaurant in Matewan just beneath the UMWA office. His restaurant became a popular hangout for union miners. Lively has testified that he began operating the restaurant after the Battle of Matewan, a gun battle on May 19, 1920, which",0,
"THE MARKET-HUNTER 171 THE PATH-MASTER 197 IN NAUVOO 223 MARLITT'S SHOES 241 PASQUE FLORIDA 263 A YOUNG MAN IN A HURRY ""Soyez tranquilles, mesdames.... Je suis un jeune homme press.... Mais modeste.""--LABICHE. At ten minutes before five in the evening the office doors of the Florida and Key West Railway Company flew open, and a young man emerged in a hurry. Suit-case in one hand, umbrella in the other, he sped along the corridor to the elevator-shaft, arriving in time to catch a glimpse of the lighted roof of the cage sliding into depths below. ""Down!"" he shouted; but the glimmering cage disappeared, descending until darkness enveloped it. Then the young man jammed his hat on his head, seized the suit-case and umbrella, and galloped down the steps. The spiral marble staircase echoed his clattering flight; scrub-women heard him coming and fled; he leaped a pail of water and a mop; several old gentlemen flattened themselves against the wall to give him room; and a blond young person with pencils in her hair lisped ""Gee!"" as he whizzed past and plunged through the storm-doors, which swung back, closing behind him with a hollow thwack. Outside in the darkness, gray with whirling snowflakes, he saw the wet lamps of cabs shining, and he darted along the line of hansoms and coups in frantic search for his own. ""Oh, there you are!"" he panted, flinging his suit-case up to a snow-covered driver. ""Do your best now; we're late!"" And he leaped into the dark coup, slammed the door, and sank back on the cushions, turning up the collar of his heavy overcoat. There was a young lady in the farther corner of the cab, buried to her nose in a fur coat. At intervals she shivered and pressed a fluffy muff against her face. A glimmer from the sleet-smeared lamps fell across her knees. Down-town flew the cab, swaying around icy corners, bumping over car-tracks, lurching, rattling, jouncing, while its silent occupants, huddled in separate corners, brooded moodily at their respective windows. Snow blotted the glass, melting and running down; and over the watery panes yellow light from shop windows played fantastically, distorting vision. Presently the young man pulled out his watch, fumbled for a match-box, struck a light, and groaned as he read the time. At the sound of the match striking, the young lady turned her head. Then, as the bright flame illuminated the young man's face, she sat bolt upright, dropping the muff to her lap with a cry of dismay. He looked up at her. The match burned his fingers; he dropped it and hurriedly lighted another; and the flickering radiance brightened upon the face of a girl whom he had never before laid eyes on. ""Good heavens!"" he said. ""Where's my sister?"" The young lady was startled, but resolute. ""You have made a dreadful mistake,"" she said; ""you are in the wrong cab--"" The match went out; there came a brief moment of darkness, then the cab turned a corner, and the ghostly light of electric lamps played over them in quivering succession. ""Will you please stop this cab?"" she said, unsteadily. ""You have mistaken my cab for yours. I was expecting my brother."" Stunned, he made no movement to obey. A sudden thrill of fear passed through her. ""I must ask you to stop this cab,"" she faltered. The idiotic blankness of his expression changed to acute alarm. ""Stop this cab?"" he cried. ""Nothing on earth can induce me to stop this cab!"" ""You must!"" she insisted, controlling her voice. ""You must stop it at once!"" ""How can I?"" he asked, excitedly; ""I'm late now; I haven't one second to spare!"" ""Do you refuse to leave this cab?"" ""I beg that you will compose yourself--"" ""Will you go?"" she insisted. A jounce sent them flying towards each other; they collided and recoiled, regarding one another in breathless indignation. ""This is simply hideous!"" said the young lady, seizing the door-handle. ""Please don't open that door!"" he said. She tried to wrench it open; the handle stuck--or perhaps the strength had left her wrist. But it was not courage that failed, for she faced him, head held high, and-- ""You coward!"" she said. Over his face a deep flush burned--and it was a good face, too--youthfully wilful, perhaps, with a firm, clean-cut chin and pleasant eyes. ""If I were a coward,"" he said, ""I'd stop this cab and get out. I never faced anything that frightened me half as much as you do!"" She looked him straight in the eyes, one hand twisting at the knob. ""Don't you suppose that this mistake of mine is as humiliating and unwelcome to me as it is to you?"" he said. ""If you stop this cab it will ruin somebody's life. Not mine--if it were my own life, I wouldn't hesitate."" Her hand, still clasping the silver knob, suddenly fell limp. ""You say that you are in a hurry?"" she asked, with dry lips. ""A desperate hurry,"" he replied. ""So am I,"" she said, bitterly; ""and, thanks to your stupidity, I must make the journey without my brother!"" There was a silence, then she turned towards him again: ""Where do you imagine this cab is going?"" ""It's going to Cortlandt Street--isn't it?"" Suddenly the recollection came to him that it was her cab, and that he had only told the driver to drive fast. The color left his face as he pressed it to the sleet-shot window. Fitful flickers of light, snow, darkness--that was all he could see. He turned a haggard countenance on her; he was at her mercy. But there was nothing vindictive in her. ""I also am going to Cortlandt Street; you need not be alarmed,"" she said. The color came back to his cheeks. ""I suppose,"" he ventured, ""that you are trying to catch the Eden Limited, as I am."" ""Yes,"" she said, coldly; ""my brother--"" An expression of utter horror came into her face. ""What on",0,
"Life on a research station on Neptune's moon Triton was not for the faint of heart. The extreme cold temperatures and isolation posed significant challenges for the scientists stationed there. Despite the inhospitable environment, a dedicated team of researchers had made Triton their home.

Thomas Gilchrist, an astrophysicist, had been on Triton for nearly two years. He had always been fascinated by the outer reaches of the solar system, and being given the opportunity to study the unique environment of Triton was a dream come true. However, the reality of life on Triton proved to be more challenging than he had anticipated.

Thomas spent most of his days studying the geological formations on Triton's surface, trying to unravel the mysteries of its formation. The research station was equipped with state-of-the-art equipment, allowing him to collect valuable data. But the isolation weighed heavily on him. There was no easy escape from the cold, desolate moon.

Thomas often found solace in his conversations with Rafael Alemn, a biologist who had joined the research team a few months before. Rafael was originally from Spain and had a zest for life that contrasted with the frigid surroundings. His presence brought a much-needed warmth to the station.

Rafael, too, had his reasons for choosing Triton as his research destination. He wanted to study the potential for life in extreme environments. Triton's icy surface presented a unique opportunity for him to explore the limits of life's resilience. But as he delved deeper into his work, Rafael couldn't shake the feeling of loneliness that pervaded the station.

Their conversations often revolved around the lack of recreational activities on Triton. Life on the moon was centered around work and maintaining stable family relationships. The researchers were discouraged from developing romantic relationships with each other, as it was believed that the isolation and extreme conditions would hinder successful relationships.

The decision to prioritize stable family life had its reasons. It was thought that maintaining a sense of normalcy and stability would help the scientists cope with the harsh conditions and reduce the potential for emotional distress. But for Thomas and Rafael, the absence of companionship only intensified their longing for human connection.

In their late-night conversations, Thomas and Rafael would often discuss their reasons for being on Triton. They would share their dreams, hopes, and the sacrifices they had made to pursue their passion for scientific discovery. They found solace in each other's company, forming a bond that transcended the isolation and coldness of Triton.

But no matter how deep their friendship grew, the longing for companionship remained. It was a constant ache in their hearts, a yearning for human touch and intimacy. They both understood the importance of their work and the sacrifices they had made, but it didn't make the longing any easier to bear.

As time passed, they realized that their research on Triton could only take them so far. They yearned for a deeper connection, for the presence of loved ones, and the comfort of home. They began to question whether the sacrifices they had made were worth the sense of isolation they felt.

Their experiences on Triton had taught them the true value of human relationships, of the warmth and support that comes from being surrounded by loved ones. They longed for the simple pleasures of everyday life, the laughter, and the intimacy that had become distant memories.

Life on a research station on Triton was a constant battle against the elements and the isolation. Thomas and Rafael had dedicated their lives to unraveling the mysteries of the universe, but they had come to realize that the pursuit of knowledge sometimes came at a great cost. As they continued their work, their longing for companionship and a sense of belonging remained, a reminder of the complex and paradoxical nature of human existence.",1,
"in a faded and frayed suit of mustard-colour, holding in his hand a broken straw hat. His face was rather fat and roundish; his build powerful but paunchy. The colour of face and hands showed open-air life and work. His manner was slow, apathetic, heavy. His speech was slow too, but it was the speech of an educated man, and the voice was curiously gentle. ""My wife's ill, doctor. Can you come?"" ""I can. What's the matter with her, Mr Tarn?"" He explained. I do not regard child-bearing as illness, and told him so. I told him further that he ought to have made his arrangements and to have engaged a doctor and nurse beforehand. ""In her own country they do not regard it as illness either. The women there do not have doctor or nurse. She did not wish it. But, however, as she seemed to suffer--"" ""Well, well. We'll get on. Where do you live?"" ""Felonsdene."" ""Eight miles away and right up on the downs. Phew! Can I get my car there?"" ""Most of the way at any rate--we could always walk the rest."" ""We'll chance it. I'll bring the car round. Shan't keep you a minute, Mr Tarn."" I kept him rather longer than that. There were the lamps to see to, and I had directions to give to my servants. I did not take my driver with me. He had been at work since eight in the morning. When I re-entered the surgery I found Tarn still standing in just the same pose and place, as if he had not moved a hair's-breadth since I left him. ""Ready now,"" I said, as I picked up my bag. He took out a pinch of sovereigns from his waistcoat-pocket, seven or eight of them. ""Your fee, doctor,"" he said. ""That can wait until I've done my work. Come along. Shall I lend you an overcoat?"" He thanked me but refused it, saying that he was used to all weathers. The night was fairly warm too. He sat beside me on the front seat. The first six miles were easy enough along a good road, and I talked to him as I drove. I omit the professional part of our conversation--the questions which a doctor would naturally put on such an occasion. ""So your wife's a foreigner,"" I said. ""What nationality?"" ""She is a woman of colour--a negress."" It is true that all coloured people inspire me with a feeling of physical repulsion, and equally true that I can set all feelings of repulsion aside when there is work to be done. ""Ah!"" I said. ""And you live up at Felonsdene. To tell the truth, I didn't know anybody lived there. I remember the place--came on it two years ago or more when I was roaming over the downs. There was a farm-house all in ruins--and, let me see, was there a cottage? I didn't come upon anybody living there then. I remember that, because I was thirsty after my walk and couldn't get a drink."" ""There was no one there then, and there is no cottage. We came last year. Part of the farm-house has been repaired."" ""Well, you've struck about the loneliest spot in England. Who's your landlord?"" ""Eh? It's mine--I bought it. Two acres and the farm-house. Had trouble to get it--a deal of trouble."" ""And who's with your wife now?"" I asked. ""Nobody. She's alone in the house."" ""Well, that's not right,"" I said. ""We have no servants--do everything ourselves. The nearest house is a farmer's at Sandene, three miles away, and we've had no dealings with him. It couldn't be helped, and--she's different, you know. I was not long in coming to you. I caught the mail-cart as soon as I reached the road, and got a lift."" ""Still, I'm thinking--how am I to get on?"" ""You'll find I can do anything a woman can do, and do it better. I am more intelligent and I have no nerves. You must pull up at the next gate, doctor. We strike across the downs there."" We had done the six miles, mostly up hill, in twenty-one minutes. Now we turned through the gate, along a turf track deeply rutted. Luckily the weather had been dry for the last fortnight. We crawled up to the top of the crest and then along it for a mile. I saw lights ahead in a hollow below. A dog barked savagely. ""That Felonsdene?"" I asked. ""That's it. The descent is bad."" When I got to it I found that it was very bad. I stopped the engines. ""If we break our necks we shan't be much use,"" I said. ""I'll leave the car here. There's nobody to run away with it."" ""Shall we take a lamp?"" he asked. ""Better."" He picked up my bag, unhitched one lamp, and extinguished the other, while I spread the rug over the seats. His ordinary slowness was deceptive. When he was actually doing something he was remarkably quick without being hurried. He was quick too in seeing a mechanical device--that was clear from the way he handled the lamps. We began the brief descent, and the dog barked more furiously than ever. ""Is that dog loose?"" I asked, as we neared the house. ""Yes,"" he said. ""But he's educated. He'd kill a stranger who came alone; he won't touch you."" He gave a whistle and the barking stopped. The dog, an enormous black retriever, came running towards us; his eyes in the lamplight had a liquid trustfulness. ""Heel,"" said Tarn sharply, and the dog paced quietly behind him, taking no notice of me whatever. We went through a yard surrounded by a wall of rough stone. By the light of the lamp I saw that the wall had been mended in places. There was a rough shed on the left, with crates and packing-cases under it. The front door was flush with the wall of the house. It was unlocked, and when Tarn",0,
"Muldoon had always been a skeptic when it came to job advertisements. He had seen too many scams and hoaxes to believe that any good could come out of responding to a mysterious ad. But on that fateful day, a particular advertisement caught his eye. The words were simple yet intriguing: ""Wanted: Broker for Secret Project. Inquire within.""

Curiosity got the better of Muldoon as he found himself dialing the number listed in the ad. After a few rings, a deep voice on the other side of the line answered, ""Hello, this is the Twins' Office. How may I assist you?""

Muldoon hesitated for a moment, unsure of how to proceed. ""Um, yes, I'm calling about the job advertisement I saw. The one for the broker position.""

There was a brief pause before the voice responded, ""Ah, splendid! I'm Mr. Poe, the Twins' assistant. They will be delighted to meet with you. Can you come to their office tomorrow at noon?""

Muldoon felt a surge of both excitement and apprehension. ""Yes, I can be there.""

The next day, he arrived at the address provided, a quaint building tucked away in a quiet neighborhood. The office had an air of mystery, as if it held secrets waiting to be discovered. Muldoon took a deep breath and walked inside.

The office was impeccably organized, with bookshelves lining the walls, stacked with a variety of volumes. The smell of old books filled the air. Muldoon was greeted by a pair of identical twin brothers, both wearing bowler hats and suspenders. They had an otherworldly radiance about them, as if they were characters from a bygone era.

""Ah, Mr. Muldoon, welcome!"" one of the twins exclaimed with a wide grin. ""I am Mortimer, and this is my brother, Montague.""

Muldoon shook their hands, feeling a shiver run down his spine. ""Nice to meet you both,"" he managed to say.

They led him into a small, dimly lit room filled with antique furniture. The walls were adorned with peculiar paintings, and a jar containing various colorful liquids sat on a table in the corner.

""Before we proceed, Mr. Muldoon, we must clarify the nature of our project,"" Montague began, his voice carrying a mix of excitement and mystery. ""You see, we have been working on an invention that will change the world, and we require a skilled broker to help bring it to fruition.""

Muldoon's skepticism resurfaced, but he couldn't help but be drawn in by the twins' enthusiasm. ""What exactly is this project?"" he inquired cautiously.

Mortimer and Montague exchanged a knowing look before Montague answered, ""We cannot reveal all the details just yet. What we can say is that it involves a groundbreaking fusion of science and art, something that has never been done before.""

The cryptic response only fueled Muldoon's curiosity. ""Alright, I'm intrigued,"" he admitted. ""But why me? Why did you choose me for this role?""

Mortimer leaned back in his chair, a mischievous glint in his eye. ""Mr. Muldoon, we have observed your astute mind, your ability to navigate complex situations. We believe you possess the talent and the discretion needed for this endeavor.""

Muldoon felt a mix of flattery and unease. The twins' words seemed almost too perfect, too tailored to his skills. ""I do have one question,"" he said, trying to maintain his composure. ""What guarantees do I have that this is not some elaborate scheme?""

Montague leaned forward, his voice dropping to a whisper. ""Mr. Muldoon, rest assured, we are nothing if not honorable. We can provide you with a generous salary, complete autonomy in your position, and, of course, the opportunity to be part of something monumental.""

Muldoon pondered their words, his mind whirling with uncertainty. Finally, he made up his mind. The allure of the unknown, the chance to be part of a mysterious project, was too tempting to ignore. ""Alright,"" he said. ""Count me in.""

Mortimer and Montague exchanged triumphant smiles. ""Splendid!"" they exclaimed in unison. ""Welcome to the team, Mr. Muldoon.""

As the days turned into weeks and then months, Muldoon found himself immersed in a world of intrigue and discovery. The twins led him through a labyrinth of experiments, each more awe-inspiring than the last. They introduced him to scientists, artists, and visionaries, all collaborating on their grand project, which was slowly taking shape.

Muldoon marveled at the twins' ingenuity and passion. They pushed the boundaries of what was deemed possible, blurring the lines between science and art, innovation and imagination. Their project began to unfold like a symphony, with Muldoon playing the role of conductor, orchestrating the various elements with precision and grace.

As time went on, Muldoon realized that the twins' project was not just about making a groundbreaking invention; it was about challenging the very fabric of society's limitations. It was about reminding humanity of its innate creativity and its ability to shape a better future.

In the end, Muldoon",1,
"Sir John Temple (1600 – 14 November 1677) was an Anglo-Irish lawyer, courtier and politician who sat in the Irish House of Commons at various times between 1641 and 1677 and in the House of Commons of England from 1646 to 1648. He was Master of the Rolls in Ireland. Temple was born in Ireland, the son of Sir William Temple, provost of Trinity College Dublin, and his wife Martha Harrison, daughter of Robert Harrison of Derbyshire. He was educated at Trinity College Dublin and spent some time travelling abroad.[1] On his return he entered the personal service of Charles I and was knighted. Temple returned to Ireland and on 31 January 1640 succeeded Sir Christopher Wandesford as Master of the Rolls in Ireland and was admitted to the Privy Council of Ireland. When the Irish Rebellion of 1641 broke out in October he served the government in provisioning the city. On 23 July 1642, he was elected Member of the Irish House of Commons for County Meath, being described as of Ballycrath, County Carlow. He tended to support the Parliamentary side and in August 1643 he was suspended from his office by the Lords Justices, Sir John Borlase and Sir Henry Tichborne, acting on instructions from King Charles. He was imprisoned in Dublin Castle with Sir William Parsons, Sir Adam Loftus, and Sir Robert Meredyth. The main charge against him was of writing in May and June two scandalous letters against the King, which suggested the King had favoured the rebels.[1] After a year's imprisonment he was exchanged, and in 1645 was chosen MP for Chichester in the Long Parliament of the English House of Commons[2] in compensation for the harsh treatment he had undergone. He received special thanks for the services he had rendered to the English interest in Ireland at the beginning of the rebellion.[1] In 1646 Temple published his Irish Rebellion; or an history of the beginning and first progresse of the generall rebellion raised within the kingdom of Ireland upon the … 23 Oct. 1641. Together with the barbarous cruelties and bloody massacres which ensued thereupon,[3] which created an immediate and great sensation. Its statements were received with unquestioning confidence, as the work of a professed eye-witness who could speak with authority, and did much to inflame popular indignation in Britain against the Irish.[4] Subsequently, the truth of many of its statements have been questioned and it became viewed as a partisan pamphlet rather than an historical treatise.[4] Temple's Irish Rebellion was often praised by authors hostile to Roman Catholicism, including John Milton [5] and Voltaire.[6] The Irish were so incensed against the book that one of the first resolutions of the Patriot Parliament of 1689 was to order it to be burnt by the common hangman.[1] In 1647, after peace was concluded between Ormonde and Parliament, Temple was appointed a commissioner for the government of Munster, and on 16 October 1648 was made joint commissioner with Sir William Parsons for the administration of the Great Seal of Ireland. However, he voted with the majority on 5 December 1648 in favour of the proposed compromise with King Charles, and was excluded from Parliament under Pride's Purge. For the next four years he took no part in public affairs, living quietly in London. As a result of his personal experience of the outbreak of the Irish Rebellion, Temple was appointed on 21 November 1653 as a commissioner ""to consider and advise from time to time how the titles of the Irish and others to any estate in Ireland, and likewise their delinquency according to their respective qualifications, might be put in the most speedy and exact way of adjudication consistent with justice"". When this work was completed, he returned to England in 1654, and, expressed his willingness to resume the regular execution of his old office of Master of the Rolls. In June 1655, he returned to Ireland with a highly recommendatory letter in his favour from Cromwell addressed to the Lord Deputy of Ireland, Charles Fleetwood and the Council of State. He received an increased official salary, and from time to time was given several grants of money for special services rendered by him. In September 1654 he was joined with Sir R. King, Benjamin Worsley, and others in a commission for letting and setting of houses and lands belonging to the state in the counties of Dublin, Kildare, and Carlow, and on 13 June 1656 he was appointed a commissioner for determining all differences among the adventurers concerning lands, etc. In recompense for his services he received on 6 July 1658 a grant of two leases for twenty-one years, the one comprising the town and lands of Moyle, Castletown, Park, etc., adjoining the town of Carlow, amounting to about 1,490 acres, in part afterwards confirmed to him under the Act of Settlement 1662 on 18 June 1666; the other of certain lands in the barony of Balrothery West, Co. Dublin, to which were added those of Lispoble (or Lispopple) in the same county on 30 March 1659 for a similar term of years. He obtained license to go to England for a whole year or more on 21 April 1659.[1] At the Restoration of Charles II in 1660, Temple was confirmed in his office of Master of the Rolls, sworn a member of the Privy Council, appointed a trustee for the '49 officers, and on 4 May 1661 was elected, with his eldest son Sir William Temple, 1st Baronet, to represent County Carlow in Parliament. On 6 May he obtained for the payment of a fine of £540, a reversionary lease from the queen mother Henrietta Maria of the park of Blandesby or Blansby, Pickering, Yorkshire, for a term of forty years. He received a confirmation in perpetuity of his lands in Co. Dublin, including those of Palmerstown, under the Act of Settlement on 29 July 1666; to which were added on 20 May 1669 others in counties Kilkenny, Meath, Westmeath, and Dublin. Other",0,
"reading the _Contes Drolatiques_, one could almost find one’s way about the towns and villages of Touraine, unassisted by map or guide. Not only is this book a work of art from its historical information and topographical accuracy; its claims to that distinction rest upon a broader foundation. Written in the nineteenth century in imitation of the style of the sixteenth, it is a triumph of literary archaeology. It is a model of that which it professes to imitate; the production of a writer who, to accomplish it, must have been at once historian, linguist, philosopher, archaeologist, and anatomist, and each in no ordinary degree. In France, his work has long been regarded as a classic--as a faithful picture of the last days of the moyen age, when kings and princesses, brave gentlemen and haughty ladies laughed openly at stories and jokes which are considered disgraceful by their more fastidious descendants. In England the difficulties of the language employed, and the quaintness and peculiarity of its style, have placed it beyond the reach of all but those thoroughly acquainted with the French of the sixteenth century. Taking into consideration the vast amount of historical information enshrined in its pages, the archaeological value which it must always possess for the student, and the dramatic interest of its stories, the translator has thought that an English edition of Balzac’s chef-d’oeuvre would be acceptable to many. It has, of course, been impossible to reproduce in all its vigour and freshness the language of the original. Many of the quips and cranks and puns have been lost in the process of Anglicising. These unavoidable blemishes apart, the writer ventures to hope that he has treated this great masterpiece in a reverent spirit, touched it with no sacrilegious hand, but, on the contrary, given as close a translation as the dissimilarities of the two languages permit. With this idea, no attempt had been made to polish or round many of the awkwardly constructed sentences which are characteristic of this volume. Rough, and occasionally obscure, they are far more in keeping with the spirit of the original than the polished periods of modern romance. Taking into consideration the many difficulties which he has had to overcome, and which those best acquainted with the French edition will best appreciate, the translator claims the indulgence of the critical reader for any shortcomings he may discover. The best plea that can be offered for such indulgence is the fact that, although _Les Contes Drolatiques_ was completed and published in 1837, the present is the first English version ever brought before the public. London, January, 1874 VOLUME I THE FIRST TEN TALES CONTENTS PROLOGUE THE FAIR IMPERIA THE VENIAL SIN HOW THE GOOD MAN BRUYN TOOK A WIFE HOW THE SENESCHAL STRUGGLED WITH HIS WIFE’S MODESTY THAT WHICH IS ONLY A VENIAL SIN HOW AND BY WHOM THE SAID CHILD WAS PROCURED HOW THE SAID LOVE-SIN WAS REPENTED OF AND LED TO GREAT MOURNING THE KING’S SWEETHEART THE DEVIL’S HEIR THE MERRIE JESTS OF KING LOUIS THE ELEVENTH THE HIGH CONSTABLE’S WIFE THE MAID OF THILOUSE THE BROTHER-IN-ARMS THE VICAR OF AZAY-LE-RIDEAU THE REPROACH EPILOGUE PROLOGUE This is a book of the highest flavour, full of right hearty merriment, spiced to the palate of the illustrious and very precious tosspots and drinkers, to whom our worthy compatriot, Francois Rabelais, the eternal honour of Touraine, addressed himself. Be it nevertheless understood, the author has no other desire than to be a good Touranian, and joyfully to chronicle the merry doings of the famous people of this sweet and productive land, more fertile in cuckolds, dandies and witty wags than any other, and which has furnished a good share of men of renown in France, as witness the departed Courier of piquant memory; Verville, author of _Moyen de Parvenir_, and others equally well known, among whom we will specially mention the Sieur Descartes, because he was a melancholy genius, and devoted himself more to brown studies than to drinks and dainties, a man of whom all the cooks and confectioners of Tours have a wise horror, whom they despise, and will not hear spoken of, and say, “Where does he live?” if his name is mentioned. Now this work is the production of the joyous leisure of good old monks, of whom there are many vestiges scattered about the country, at Grenadiere-les-St.-Cyr, in the village of Sacche-les-Azay-le-Rideau, at Marmoustiers, Veretz, Roche-Cobon, and the certain storehouses of good stories, which storehouses are the upper stories of old canons and wise dames, who remember the good old days when they could enjoy a hearty laugh without looking to see if their hilarity disturbed the sit of your ruffle, as do the young women of the present day, who wish to take their pleasure gravely--a custom which suits our Gay France as much as a water jug would the head of a queen. Since laughter is a privilege granted to man alone, and he has sufficient causes for tears within his reach, without adding to them by books, I have considered it a thing most patriotic to publish a drachm of merriment for these times, when weariness falls like a fine rain, wetting us, soaking into us, and dissolving those ancient customs which make the people to reap public amusement from the Republic. But of those old pantagruelists who allowed God and the king to conduct their own affairs without putting of their finger in the pie oftener than they could help, being content to look on and laugh, there are very few left. They are dying out day by day in such manner that I fear greatly to see these illustrious fragments of the ancient breviary spat upon, staled upon, set at naught, dishonoured, and blamed, the which I should be loath to see, since I have and bear great respect for the refuse of our Gallic antiquities. Bear in mind also, ye wild critics, you scrapers-up of words, harpies who mangle the intentions",0,

"Gwynne Shotwell (née Rowley; born November 23, 1963) is an American businesswoman and engineer. She is the president and chief operating officer of SpaceX, an American space transportation company, where she is responsible for day-to-day operations and company growth.[1] As of 2022[update], Shotwell is listed as the 31st most powerful woman in the world by Forbes.[2] In 2020, she was included on Time's list of the 100 most influential people in the world.[3] Shotwell was born in Evanston, Illinois, as the middle of three daughters to a brain surgeon and an artist, and was raised in Libertyville, Illinois.[4] In 1982, she graduated from Libertyville High School.[5] In 1969, she watched a television broadcast of the Apollo 11 mission with her family, but remembers finding it ""boring"" and was not interested in space at the time. Shotwell excelled in both academics and athletics in high school, where she was on the cheerleading and Varsity basketball teams while achieving at the top of her class.[4] Her interests changed during high school after her mother took her to a panel discussion at the Illinois Institute of Technology by the Society of Women Engineers, where a mechanical engineer in particular inspired Shotwell to become an engineer.[6] Following this, she decided to apply to Northwestern University, where she received a Bachelor of Science in mechanical engineering, and later a Master of Science degree in applied mathematics.[4][7] At the beginning of her career, Shotwell had an interview with IBM on the day of the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, which disturbed her and she did not get a job offer. Instead, Shotwell took a job in the automotive industry at Chrysler Corporation's management training program, which she initially enjoyed[7] but later grew tired of[4] and left to return to Northwestern for her graduate degree.[8] In 1988, Shotwell began work at the El Segundo research center of The Aerospace Corporation, and did technical work on military space research and development contracts. An early project she worked on was STS-39.[7] During a ten-year tenure, she worked in thermal analysis.[4] Shotwell worked in both space systems engineering and project management positions.[9] She left The Aerospace Corporation in 1998 to become director of the space systems division at Microcosm Inc.[4] There, she served on the executive committee and was responsible for business development. Shotwell left Microcosm in 2002 to join SpaceX, a private, commercial, space exploration company founded by Elon Musk in the same year.[10] She convinced Musk that SpaceX should hire a dedicated employee to work on business development full-time during a visit to the company, but had not planned to join the company herself. Shotwell took the job two weeks later.[11] In December 2008, Shotwell was promoted to company president following her role in the successful negotiation of the first Commercial Resupply Services contract with the NASA Administrator (and former SpaceX contractor) Mike Griffin.[12] This followed SpaceX's first successful launch of the Falcon 1 on its fourth attempt earlier in the year.[13] She was responsible for leading the effort on building the Falcon Vehicle manifest to over 50 launches, generating $5 billion in revenue. This included a commercial connection to the International Space Station for resupplying services, where they were able to deliver cargo and supplies to the astronauts.[9] Shotwell is currently the President and COO of SpaceX, responsible for day-to-day operations and managing all customer and strategic relations to support company growth.[14] She oversaw the first landing of an orbital rocket's first stage on land and on an ocean platform, the first relaunch and landing of a used orbital rocket, the first controlled flyback and recovery of a payload fairing, and the first re-flight of a commercial cargo spacecraft.[9] SpaceX has a multibillion-dollar contract with NASA to deliver astronauts and science instruments to the International Space Station. On May 30, 2020, SpaceX became the first private company to launch two astronauts to Earth orbit.[15] On February 6, 2019, Polaris Industries announced that Shotwell would join their board of directors on March 1, 2019.[16] Shotwell has served on the California Space Authority Board of Directors and its executive committee after she was elected in 2004. She has served as an officer on the AIAA Space Systems Technical Committee and participates in a variety of STEM related programs. She led a committee that raised over $350,000 in scholarships for the Frank J. Redd Student Competition over 6 years.[17] Shotwell gave a TEDx Talk at TEDxChapmanU in June 2013 on the importance of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.[18] She speaks regularly to business audiences and gave a talk for the ""Captains of Industry"" series at the Brent Scowcroft Center on International Security in June 2014 on private entrepreneurial accomplishments in advancing spaceflight technology.[19] At the 2018 TED conference, Shotwell was interviewed by Chris Anderson about the future plans of SpaceX.[20] At the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing on September 28, 2018, Shotwell's talk was titled ""Launching Our Future"" and she discussed her vision and advancements for aerospace technology, as well as why diversity and the inclusion of women are necessary to advance as a society.[21] On February 8, 2023 Gwynne Shotwell, President of Starlink, announced that the company had taken measures to prevent the use of Starlink service to control combat drones.[22] SpaceX restricted the licensing of Starlink communication technology to exclude direct military use of Starlink on weapon systems. The limitation restricted use by Ukraine of Starlink antennas on uncrewed surface vehicles deployed in the fall, potentially shifting the balance of power in the naval war in the Black Sea.[23] Shotwell stated that ""Ukrainians have leveraged it in ways that were unintentional and not part of any agreement"", as the contract was intended for humanitarian purposes such as ""providing broadband internet to hospitals, banks and families affected by Russia's invasion"".[22][24] She added ""while we were pleased to provide connectivity"", SpaceX did not intend Starlink to be ""weaponized"".[24] The company apparently knew the military is using them for communications, ""and thats's okay.""[24] ""But our intent was never to have",0,
"wonder for men to conjure with..... after it has been lost to them and they have turned middle-aged. And so well did we conjure, that Romance came and for an hour led us far from the man-city and its snarling roar. Bardwell, in a way, started it by quoting from Thoreau; but it was old Trefethan, bald-headed and dewlapped, who took up the quotation and for the hour to come was romance incarnate. At first we wondered how many Scotches he had consumed since dinner, but very soon all that was forgotten. “It was in 1898--I was thirty-five then,” he said. “Yes, I know you are adding it up. You're right. I'm forty-seven now; look ten years more; and the doctors say--damn the doctors anyway!” He lifted the long glass to his lips and sipped it slowly to soothe away his irritation. “But I was young... once. I was young twelve years ago, and I had hair on top of my head, and my stomach was lean as a runner's, and the longest day was none too long for me. I was a husky back there in '98. You remember me, Milner. You knew me then. Wasn't I a pretty good bit of all right?” Milner nodded and agreed. Like Trefethan, he was another mining engineer who had cleaned up a fortune in the Klondike. “You certainly were, old man,” Milner said. “I'll never forget when you cleaned out those lumberjacks in the M. & M. that night that little newspaper man started the row. Slavin was in the country at the time,”--this to us--“and his manager wanted to get up a match with Trefethan.” “Well, look at me now,” Trefethan commanded angrily. “That's what the Goldstead did to me--God knows how many millions, but nothing left in my soul..... nor in my veins. The good red blood is gone. I am a jellyfish, a huge, gross mass of oscillating protoplasm, a--a...” But language failed him, and he drew solace from the long glass. “Women looked at me then; and turned their heads to look a second time. Strange that I never married. But the girl. That's what I started to tell you about. I met her a thousand miles from anywhere, and then some. And she quoted to me those very words of Thoreau that Bardwell quoted a moment ago--the ones about the day-born gods and the night-born.” “It was after I had made my locations on Goldstead--and didn't know what a treasure-pot that that trip creek was going to prove--that I made that trip east over the Rockies, angling across to the Great Up North there the Rockies are something more than a back-bone. They are a boundary, a dividing line, a wall impregnable and unscalable. There is no intercourse across them, though, on occasion, from the early days, wandering trappers have crossed them, though more were lost by the way than ever came through. And that was precisely why I tackled the job. It was a traverse any man would be proud to make. I am prouder of it right now than anything else I have ever done. “It is an unknown land. Great stretches of it have never been explored. There are big valleys there where the white man has never set foot, and Indian tribes as primitive as ten thousand years... almost, for they have had some contact with the whites. Parties of them come out once in a while to trade, and that is all. Even the Hudson Bay Company failed to find them and farm them. “And now the girl. I was coming up a stream--you'd call it a river in California--uncharted--and unnamed. It was a noble valley, now shut in by high canyon walls, and again opening out into beautiful stretches, wide and long, with pasture shoulder-high in the bottoms, meadows dotted with flowers, and with clumps of timberspruce--virgin and magnificent. The dogs were packing on their backs, and were sore-footed and played out; while I was looking for any bunch of Indians to get sleds and drivers from and go on with the first snow. It was late fall, but the way those flowers persisted surprised me. I was supposed to be in sub-arctic America, and high up among the buttresses of the Rockies, and yet there was that everlasting spread of flowers. Some day the white settlers will be in there and growing wheat down all that valley. “And then I lifted a smoke, and heard the barking of the dogs--Indian dogs--and came into camp. There must have been five hundred of them, proper Indians at that, and I could see by the jerking-frames that the fall hunting had been good. And then I met her--Lucy. That was her name. Sign language--that was all we could talk with, till they led me to a big fly--you know, half a tent, open on the one side where a campfire burned. It was all of moose-skins, this fly--moose-skins, smoke-cured, hand-rubbed, and golden-brown. Under it everything was neat and orderly as no Indian camp ever was. The bed was laid on fresh spruce boughs. There were furs galore, and on top of all was a robe of swanskins--white swan-skins--I have never seen anything like that robe. And on top of it, sitting cross-legged, was Lucy. She was nut-brown. I have called her a girl. But she was not. She was a woman, a nut-brown woman, an Amazon, a full-blooded, full-bodied woman, and royal ripe. And her eyes were blue. “That's what took me off my feet--her eyes--blue, not China blue, but deep blue, like the sea and sky all melted into one, and very wise. More than that, they had laughter in them--warm laughter, sun-warm and human, very human, and... shall I say feminine? They were. They were a woman's eyes, a proper woman's eyes. You know what that means. Can I say more? Also, in those blue eyes were, at the same time, a wild unrest, a wistful yearning, and a repose,",0,

"when you're with it."" ""The ship ought to be checked. Our bodies ought to be looked at."" ""We know there is no danger any more, Kelly. Do not go. There are so many interesting experiences we have not even begun to share yet. We are only half way through your life and we have not even started to experience your impressions of your colorful and complex Earth culture. And we have not even started on the adult lives of Lakrit or Lljub. Come back with your Crew, Kelly."" ""But no one's checked the ship for over a year!"" ""Please do not worry about the ship, Kelly. In fifty years nothing has gone wrong. We can trust the ship thoroughly now, it will take care of us."" ""_It_ will take care of _us_! That's a helluva way to look at it!"" ""There can be no danger now, Kelly. In fifty years we have encountered every conceivable danger, every imaginable kind of world or possible menace."" ""Have we?"" Kelly thought. ""Every danger from outside maybe, and I'm not even sure of that. But how about danger from inside?"" ""Inside?"" ""Us. How about apathy for instance? Apathy's a real danger. You talk about this space-can like it was a big metal mother! Listen, I'm supposed to see that this tub holds together. At least until we get back somewhere near enough to the Solar system so we'll feel we've been somewhere else!"" ""But, Kelly--"" ""I'm getting out for a while, I tell you!"" ""All right,"" the Crew sighed. The light loom faded a bit, down to a self-indulgent glow. ""Hurry back to us, Kelly."" ""I'll give some thought to it."" So Kelly concentrated on the increasingly painful and difficult task of tearing his consciousness free of the big glob of protoplasm in the tank, and getting it back into his body that hibernated in the bunkroom. As usual the switch was too painful. It stretched and stretched and finally snapped in an all too familiar explosion of shocking light. * * * * * His bones creaked. His skin rustled as he sat up and looked around. There was the old feeling that there was dust over everything when there was no dust. There was all that emptiness sweeping away into the endless silence and he thought again, as he always did, how comforting and cozy it was being a part of the Crew. But someone had to check the ship. It was only machinery after all, and machinery could wear out, sooner or later. And he wasn't at all sure, as he kept insisting, that they had encountered all the possible dangers. It might seem that in fifty years you could run into everything. But fifty years was no time at all out here where time had no real meaning any more. His body squeaked as he took a few tentative steps about the bunkroom. One did not actually forget how to walk. It was just awkward as the devil. And the blood, the entire autonomic system, tended to slow down. It seemed reluctant to step up general metabolism. Apathy. Sure it was a danger. This time, Kelly decided, I'll do something about it. He was the engineer and he had signed on the great odyssey to keep the ship going. But the Crew was part of the ship. Was not there an obligation even greater to keep the Crew going? The four others lived but almost imperceptibly in some very low state of slowed metabolism there in the bunkroom and Kelly looked at them. The faithful and the wonderful ones. The ones with whom he had shared so many dangers and awful silences that the five of them had been able to evolve the idea of the protoplasm in the tank and merge their consciousness in it. Kew, the Venusian, in her bowl of self-renewing nitrate. Lakrit from a Jovian satellite, a fluorine fellow of distinction inside a sphere of gaseous sulphur. A crystalline character with a sense of humor named Lljub, whose form gave off a paled glint as it nourished itself on silicates. And a highly intelligent but humble six-foot-long sponge labeled Urdaz stuck in a foundation of chemical sediment at the bottom of a tank of reprocessing salt water. Each with their own special kind of appendages and sensitivities, each able to move his special closed-system about through the ship by means of clever types of mobility. But basically, in outward form, they were too alien to have much in common. Only as intelligences, as life forces, could they share a common bed. And it had evolved to that in fifty years. A bed of protoplasm in a shock-absorbent tank. Kelly looked at them warmly and thought about how it had worked out. The strange thing was that it did have a lot of good things to recommend it. Or had had them. It had solved the problem of intimate communication and driven back the tides of loneliness. It had lessened the dangers of mental and physical illnesses in the material bodies and assured a prolongation of the life of each body, which was important in itself, for this trip had proven to be a lot longer than even the most pessimistic had anticipated. The Crew, pulsing in its tank, Kelly thought oddly, is a new life form. One that had evolved to meet the exigencies of deep space which had proven to be alien to any adaptability common to any world that rotated through it. But maybe they were too damn happy, Kelly thought. Too contented. If they ran into a real emergency now, the ship would be finished. The Crew in the tank was, itself, incapable of action of any overt kind. It could not manipulate anything. It could only be happy. And the bodies here in the bunkroom could not rally fast enough to meet a sudden crisis. And they had agreed that the first law was survival. But to survive this way might well",0,
"that took risks on hanging, and in which my client held a policy, it is hard to see how he could decently have been acquitted. If your Honor would like to hear about it for instruction and guidance of your Honor's mind, this unfortunate man, my client, will consent to give himself the pain of relating it under oath."" The district attorney said: ""Your Honor, I object. Such a statement would be in the nature of evidence, and the testimony in this case is closed. The prisoner's statement should have been introduced three years ago, in the spring of 1881."" ""In a statutory sense,"" said the judge, ""you are right, and in the Court of Objections and Technicalities you would get a ruling in your favor. But not in a Court of Acquittal. The objection is overruled."" ""I except,"" said the district attorney. ""You cannot do that,"" the judge said. ""I must remind you that in order to take an exception you must first get this case transferred for a time to the Court of Exceptions on a formal motion duly supported by affidavits. A motion to that effect by your predecessor in office was denied by me during the first year of this trial. Mr. Clerk, swear the prisoner."" The customary oath having been administered, I made the following statement, which impressed the judge with so strong a sense of the comparative triviality of the offense for which I was on trial that he made no further search for mitigating circumstances, but simply instructed the jury to acquit, and I left the court, without a stain upon my reputation: ""I was born in 1856 in Kalamakee, Mich., of honest and reputable parents, one of whom Heaven has mercifully spared to comfort me in my later years. In 1867 the family came to California and settled near Nigger Head, where my father opened a road agency and prospered beyond the dreams of avarice. He was a reticent, saturnine man then, though his increasing years have now somewhat relaxed the austerity of his disposition, and I believe that nothing but his memory of the sad event for which I am now on trial prevents him from manifesting a genuine hilarity. ""Four years after we had set up the road agency an itinerant preacher came along, and having no other way to pay for the night's lodging that we gave him, favored us with an exhortation of such power that, praise God, we were all converted to religion. My father at once sent for his brother, the Hon. William Ridley of Stockton, and on his arrival turned over the agency to him, charging him nothing for the franchise nor plant--the latter consisting of a Winchester rifle, a sawed-off shotgun, and an assortment of masks made out of flour sacks. The family then moved to Ghost Rock and opened a dance house. It was called 'The Saints' Rest Hurdy-Gurdy,' and the proceedings each night began with prayer. It was there that my now sainted mother, by her grace in the dance, acquired the _sobriquet_ of 'The Bucking Walrus.' ""In the fall of '75 I had occasion to visit Coyote, on the road to Mahala, and took the stage at Ghost Rock. There were four other passengers. About three miles beyond Nigger Head, persons whom I identified as my Uncle William and his two sons held up the stage. Finding nothing in the express box, they went through the passengers. I acted a most honorable part in the affair, placing myself in line with the others, holding up my hands and permitting myself to be deprived of forty dollars and a gold watch. From my behavior no one could have suspected that I knew the gentlemen who gave the entertainment. A few days later, when I went to Nigger Head and asked for the return of my money and watch my uncle and cousins swore they knew nothing of the matter, and they affected a belief that my father and I had done the job ourselves in dishonest violation of commercial good faith. Uncle William even threatened to retaliate by starting an opposition dance house at Ghost Rock. As 'The Saints' Rest' had become rather unpopular, I saw that this would assuredly ruin it and prove a paying enterprise, so I told my uncle that I was willing to overlook the past if he would take me into the scheme and keep the partnership a secret from my father. This fair offer he rejected, and I then perceived that it would be better and more satisfactory if he were dead. ""My plans to that end were soon perfected, and communicating them to my dear parents I had the gratification of receiving their approval. My father said he was proud of me, and my mother promised that although her religion forbade her to assist in taking human life I should have the advantage of her prayers for my success. As a preliminary measure looking to my security in case of detection I made an application for membership in that powerful order, the Knights of Murder, and in due course was received as a member of the Ghost Rock commandery. On the day that my probation ended I was for the first time permitted to inspect the records of the order and learn who belonged to it--all the rites of initiation having been conducted in masks. Fancy my delight when, in looking over the roll of membership, I found the third name to be that of my uncle, who indeed was junior vice-chancellor of the order! Here was an opportunity exceeding my wildest dreams--to murder I could add insubordination and treachery. It was what my good mother would have called 'a special Providence.' ""At about this time something occurred which caused my cup of joy, already full, to overflow on all sides, a circular cataract of bliss. Three men, strangers in that locality, were arrested for the stage robbery in which I had lost my money",0,
"Rant time, then. More brainfarts as one commentator required. Three things have been getting on my nerves recently. 1. The irrationality of Ex-Girlfriend 2. The Ease with which Melodrama becomes a Constructed Moodswing Indicator amongst people that should know better 3. This staying off the booze business. 1. The Ex. Without divulging too much information, the lady and mother of my child that left me on my birthday two and a half years ago for an old man that keeps ferrets, has been particularly irritating of late. Why? Well, we don't argue any more. We don't bicker. I let her keep the car, and heh, when I visit, she now allows me to drive it. She is being nice to my family. She is seeming to be more emotionally and mentally stable than ever (and she has had a lot of mindaltering issues to deal in her time, the poor mite). But she is being nice to me. And I'm finding this incredible hard to understand. I'm not used to it. She doesn't ring me up to cry down the phone anymore. She hasn't mentioned suicide for nearly three months. She is on the cusp of giving up the fags. She isn't moaning about her image. This is all very odd. I think she's fallen in love with someone, and I am finding this rather odd to come to terms with. I mean, it's not that I still like her in a coupling up kind of way, but usually when I go on my fortnightly visits, I stay on her sofa (and apart from engaging in the nookie) things were mostly the same as they were before she left. Shopping, play areas, days out, arguments, washing up together, bamboozle. (The ferret man isn't on the scene anymore, by the way). It's like my pretend family. The flip side to my split life. And now it's like she has moved on and I am left in this unpredictable limbo space. I don't think I ever fell completely out of love with her, but could happily co-exist with the frequent visits, etc etc, so I saw enough to know I was relieved that we had split up, but also saw enough to justify that I hadn't invested so much of my love in someone so unworthwhile. Now all I can see are the good sides, and it is making me mightily confused. I don't want to get back together with her (even though, in terms of seeing my son as frequently as I possibly can it would make sense). We'd drive each other beserk. She doesn't know the meaning of the word monogamy, and I don't know the meaning of the word jealousy. I just found the ferret man funny. That's why I think she left, to prove a point - that I should take her more seriously. However, the thought of her being happy with someone else, yes, HAPPY, is really annoying. And the reason I can think of for why is that it means I'll have no excuse to happily meander through my up-north life companionless if my pseudo-relationship life down-south is to end. Guess that makes me the irrational one. Hmmmm, needs some thought. 2. Constructed Melodrama. I have had to put up with a hell of a lot of emotional shit in my short life. A manic depressive mother, a violently alcoholic father, a bulimic depressed ex, the death of my grandfather (my pseudo - dad) because of hospital error and it's attendant after-effects on the above. In short, I have become incredibly cold to a lot of life's little worries. I don't mean to say that this is indicative that I don't give a toss about people that are upset about things that seem minor to me. Rather, the opposite. The smallest of problems, in one person's specific context, can really be to them something so bad that creates in them such tremendous anger, or upset, that they cannot do anything but express their emotions via the backdoor route of melodrama. Melodramatic is defined, by the first web dictionary I could get hold of, as: ""showing much stronger emotions than are necessary or usual for a situation"". I think when someone is upset by something, it is human nature to exaggerate the emotional response to the cause, either as a cry for attention, or as an attempt towards articulating the problem in one's own words so one can see the banality of the issue and then move on. I have no problem with this. It's a very human thing to do, and something we all need to do from time to time to stay sane. Where I have a problem with Melodrama, per se, is where people turn to it in a routine manner as a method of either (a) trying to generate sympathy instead of just saying in plain terms what the fucking fuck the matter is, (b) trying to persuade onself that they are a victim when, if common sense is allowed into the equation, no victim status exists. Indeed, when someone is so content with wanting to be a victim, that tiny things are played up, via melodrama, to deliberately inflate the problem, and consciously endorse the constructed victim status (c) Melodramatically state the intent to do something less than good, thus creating the impression that the emotive responses of the person are far greater than indeed they might be, but using melodrama as an excuse to blame poor actions on emotions when one really should know better. Now, I have not explained these very well here. Don't get me wrong, melodrama has it's purposes. As a cry for help, it can very effective. As a way of allowing people knowledge that you're hurting, it is effective. As a way of asking for help, without saying 'will you help me', it is effective. But the deliberate deployment of melodrama as a way to try and enforce sympathy and justify dickheadedness, is, in my mindset,",0,
"several days spent in a primitive jail. Her almost jet black hair was a tangled mess, hanging in strings to her shoulders. He wrinkled his nose in distaste at the odor filling the small compartment. There was romance in history, he thought, when viewed in the abstract, but not when one faced history in the person of a female who had languished several days in an unsanitary prison. ""Pray, Sir,"" she asked slowly, and so softly he scarcely heard her, ""Art thou the Lord? Or one of His Angels?"" Nat started to laugh, but she looked so pitiful he checked himself. ""No, I'm a human being, just like yourself--except that I've never been accused of witchcraft!"" A look of fear crossed her face. ""Verily, I testify unto thee that I am no witch, but have the fear of God before mine eyes."" She was almost frantic in her statement. She cringed farther into the corner. Nat noticed the raw wounds on her wrists where the irons had chafed her. ""Sure, sure, I believe you,"" Nat said sharply. ""They won't hang you now!"" Then he added glumly, ""But they'll probably do worse to me if they find out what _I've_ done!"" She looked up at him, wonder in her deep blue eyes, her long lashes blinking slowly. Even her bedraggled appearance and the dirt that literally covered her could not hide from Nat the beauty of her eyes. ""Then perhaps thou art an emissary of the Evil One, though thou hast a kind look to thy features that seemeth not to come of the Devil."" This time Nat laughed. He had read the ancient records known as _books_ but hearing someone talk in archaic _book_ fashion was too much. ""That was quite a speech, Pretty Eyes. But get it through your head that I'm a normal human who had a momentary lapse and did an abnormal thing. I used the paralysis ray on wide range, stopped the show and hauled you off the gallows. Right now we're in a time machine headed for ... I'm not sure where."" The girl forgot her fear in momentary puzzlement. ""Paralysis ray?"" she repeated slowly, ""Stop the show? Time machine?"" ""Oh, skip it,"" he said. ""What we need right now is a chance to get you cleaned up--and I think I know just the place. There's a pretty beach in 18th century Mexico. It's warm, and there's a fresh water stream running into the ocean. You can wash off some of that prison grime."" * * * * * The sun beat down on Nat's blonde head as he sat on a rock overlooking a river mouth and several miles of Mexican beach. Abby--he'd finally discovered that her name was Abigaile Goodyeare--was behind a clump of bushes beside the stream, vainly trying to wash her voluminous clothing. Now that the shock and humor had passed, Nat was deeply worried. He couldn't take Abby back to his own time and announce that he hadn't the heart to see her hanged, on the other hand, he simply could not take her back to 17th century New England to be hanged for witchcraft. If he dropped her off in any other time, they'd think she was insane. Nat had been making a routine historical survey, part of the work on his thesis about life in 17th century New England. And on his first venture into time, he had ended up committing one of the most serious crimes possible in his society--Time Meddling. Earlier in the day, just before leaving Earth University in the 25th century, tall, ascetic Anton Bor, Chief of the Time Inspection Corps, had impressed on him the penalties for Time Meddling. Fixing Nat with cold grey eyes, Bor had recited the familiar warning in calculated tones: ""At no time, and under no circumstance, are people in past ages to know they are being observed."" It was Nat's first solo adventure into time, and his indoctrination, as thorough as it was, had not prepared him for the shock he experienced a few hours later. He had been completely unprepared for the scene that lay before his eyes as he came out of the thick woods into a clearing. A gallows had been erected on a mound in the center of the cleared space and a large crowd had gathered to watch what seemed to be an execution. Checking his invisibility shield, Nat moved closer. A tall, gaunt man, with a look of righteous wrath on his face was reading from a scroll. Except for his clothing, the man looked exactly like Anton Bor, Chief of the TIC. Nat shook his head in disbelief, but strained his ears to hear what the man was reading. ""... she was found guilty of felonyes and witchcrafts whereof she stood indicted and sentence of death accordingly passed that she be hanged by the neck until she be dead...."" Nat tore his eyes from the man with the scroll and looked at the _witch_. He gasped audibly at what he saw, so that several people nearby looked curiously around. Realizing his error, he stood completely still until the people he had disturbed turned their attention back to the gallows. Again he looked at the woman. She was no half insane old hag, a busybody who had meddled her way into a witchcraft trial, but a bewildered, fearful young woman who couldn't have been more than 18 or 19 years old. Her hands were tied behind her back, pulling her bulky dress tight across her bosom. Her tangled, matted, black hair, the dirt on her face, her wrinkled disheveled clothing could not hide a great natural beauty. But what affected Nat most, was the look on her face. It was that of a frightened, helpless animal, cornered by a vicious, heartless predator. The self-righteous bearing of the tall man, the lack of sympathy and idle curiosity mirrored in the faces of the crowd infuriated Nat. Impulsively he had used his paralysis ray,",0,
"...what about me... Friday to say the least, was quite the day. I'll just go over the important parts, as everything else is not really important. I'm becoming a very crazy lunch time gambler lately, as I've been gambling everyday for the past week at lunch. Ever since Tai has busted out those chips and cards, oh man, I've been hooked like crazy. Although we only play for 5$ to buy in, which isn't very much, it's still fun to risk it. The more important part being that I've been winning :) So on Friday, oh man, it was hilarious, I lost $5 in the first 10 minutes, because we were continuing the game from the previous day, and I was already down $4 so I just put the rest of the cash into one game which I lost. No big deal, really, so in the second game, it was between Tai, Jason, Manh, Wade and I. The game started off pretty steadily and Manh and Wade bowed out really early in one hand where they both risked way too high for what they had. They both had 2 pairs, and the table clearly allowed for a straight which Tai had, and I still don't know why they both went all in that game. They we're in an ""alliance"" so, that just baffles me. Basically, within 10 minutes Manh and Wade were eliminated and Tai and Jason both were up quite a bit. In two games, after, the game totally switched as I beat Tai in two ""All-In"" Occasions. Putting me up to $20.25 at the end of the period. It was fucking great. The first game, I had a 2-D and a 4-H, and I was Big, so I was forced to play the hand anyway. The flop came up as something like ""5-H, 3-S, K-C"" , i was like hot fucking damn, I almost have a straight, and Tai was holding a king, while Jason folded early. The turn came up as an Ace, and i was like fuck ya, and I went all in. Tai called me thinking I was bluffing and bam!, I took his money like no one's business. The consequent game was even better. I had a 9, 10 in my hand and the flop came up as ""K, J, 10"", the Turn - ""9"" and the River was some other important card, but anyway, I went all in, and Tai called me again, and again, BAM! , I took his money. Man, it was great. Okay, enough with that, afterschool I chose to drive Greg home, I dunno why, I just felt compelled to do so. So I did :/ You might be saying, well, he lives like really close to you, so what's the problem? The problem was that I had to drive back to school to pick up Hannah to go out for dinner with Jenna and Josh. LOL ! Oh yeah, that was a real waste of gas... The four of us went to Bamboo Garden, and we ordered a variety of things, it was funny because everything that Hannah wanted to eat had meat in it, hah :p I don't think there are Asian Vegetarians, it just doesn't make sense, not eating meat? who does that? :p. So, I got the Thai Peanut Chicken, and I forgot to order how spicey I wanted it and so I got the really really really really really weak sauce. I was like ""Shit, how am I suppose to train for the Death Value Buffalo Wings?!"" We had a pretty good meal but I had to eat a portion of Hannah's and Josh a potion of Jenna's, and surpisingly Veronica almost finished her food. I was quite surprised... like very... she nearly ate the whole damn thing. So during that, everyone else was planning to go to Crystal's church for this Youth Event/Free the Natives thing and I opted to joined them instead of heading over to Leslie's early. I don't know what's worse, people telling you that you're the next generation of leaders, over and over again, or watching Double Dragon (the movie). Eh, the first 30 minutes of the Youth Event honestly felt like a mother fucking AA meeting. We sat in this circle, doing this lame ass go-around-talk-about-yourself-and-your-interest bit. I so felt like bursting out ""Hi, my name is Danny, and I'm a gamblaholic."" Jesus Christ, was that painful. It was so bad because me and Hannah just kept looking at each other with the "" WHAT THE FUCK"" look. Imagine that for 2 and a bit hours, throw in some comments by prepubescent girls who's codename, yes she said ""codename"" as ""Barbie"". SHE CALLED HERSELF BARBIE! and some African minister who was well, I don't know... wasn't very motivating, but did get across his message. Don't get me wrong, some points of the whole thing were interesting, but a majority, oh my lord, someone gouge my eyes out please! It was a a decent thing, something I never done before, and looking back at it, it wasn't that bad. I mean, sure they were preaching God, and resting everything on God, and that Christians were like the only 'good' people left on Earth, but if you replace those words with humanity and people, then it makes much more sense to people like me. So yeah, not too shabby, and Josh can play the piano really well too, and afterwords we played some obviously prevalent Church version of Hide 'n go Seek, called Sardines or something. It was fun, and I like bumped into a few pews and what not, heh, walking around in the dark = dangerous. Afterwords, I drove Josh and Jenna to Josh's house, so you know... they can do the freaky freaky... lol j/k... But yeah, after that, I went to Leslie's and everybody was already like half asleep, it was honestly like a quarter to 10, and they were all alseep. RIDICULOUS! I had some",0,

The waters of the bay contain all manner of fish, wherefore its surface is ploughed by the keels of all manner of fishing boats manned by all manner of fishermen. To protect the fish from this motley floating population many wise laws have been passed, and there is a fish patrol to see that these laws are enforced. Exciting times are the lot of the fish patrol: in its history more than one dead patrolman has marked defeat, and more often dead fishermen across their illegal nets have marked success. Wildest among the fisher-folk may be accounted the Chinese shrimp-catchers. It is the habit of the shrimp to crawl along the bottom in vast armies till it reaches fresh water, when it turns about and crawls back again to the salt. And where the tide ebbs and flows, the Chinese sink great bag-nets to the bottom, with gaping mouths, into which the shrimp crawls and from which it is transferred to the boiling-pot. This in itself would not be bad, were it not for the small mesh of the nets, so small that the tiniest fishes, little new-hatched things not a quarter of an inch long, cannot pass through. The beautiful beaches of Points Pedro and Pablo, where are the shrimp-catchers villages, are made fearful by the stench from myriads of decaying fish, and against this wasteful destruction it has ever been the duty of the fish patrol to act. When I was a youngster of sixteen, a good sloop-sailor and all-round bay-waterman, my sloop, the _Reindeer_, was chartered by the Fish Commission, and I became for the time being a deputy patrolman. After a deal of work among the Greek fishermen of the Upper Bay and rivers, where knives flashed at the beginning of trouble and men permitted themselves to be made prisoners only after a revolver was thrust in their faces, we hailed with delight an expedition to the Lower Bay against the Chinese shrimp-catchers. There were six of us, in two boats, and to avoid suspicion we ran down after dark and dropped anchor under a projecting bluff of land known as Point Pinole. As the east paled with the first light of dawn we got under way again, and hauled close on the land breeze as we slanted across the bay toward Point Pedro. The morning mists curled and clung to the water so that we could see nothing, but we busied ourselves driving the chill from our bodies with hot coffee. Also we had to devote ourselves to the miserable task of bailing, for in some incomprehensible way the _Reindeer_ had sprung a generous leak. Half the night had been spent in overhauling the ballast and exploring the seams, but the labor had been without avail. The water still poured in, and perforce we doubled up in the cockpit and tossed it out again. After coffee, three of the men withdrew to the other boat, a Columbia River salmon boat, leaving three of us in the _Reindeer_. Then the two craft proceeded in company till the sun showed over the eastern skyline. Its fiery rays dispelled the clinging vapors, and there, before our eyes, like a picture, lay the shrimp fleet, spread out in a great half-moon, the tips of the crescent fully three miles apart, and each junk moored fast to the buoy of a shrimp-net. But there was no stir, no sign of life. The situation dawned upon us. While waiting for slack water, in which to lift their heavy nets from the bed of the bay, the Chinese had all gone to sleep below. We were elated, and our plan of battle was swiftly formed. ""Throw each of your two men on to a junk,"" whispered Le Grant to me from the salmon boat. ""And you make fast to a third yourself. We'll do the same, and there's no reason in the world why we shouldn't capture six junks at the least."" Then we separated. I put the _Reindeer_ about on the other tack, ran up under the lee of a junk, shivered the mainsail into the wind and lost headway, and forged past the stern of the junk so slowly and so near that one of the patrolmen stepped lightly aboard. Then I kept off, filled the mainsail, and bore away for a second junk. Up to this time there had been no noise, but from the first junk captured by the salmon boat an uproar now broke forth. There was shrill Oriental yelling, a pistol shot, and more yelling. ""It's all up. They're warning the others,"" said George, the remaining patrolman, as he stood beside me in the cockpit. By this time we were in the thick of the fleet, and the alarm was spreading with incredible swiftness. The decks were beginning to swarm with half-awakened and half-naked Chinese. Cries and yells of warning and anger were flying over the quiet water, and somewhere a conch shell was being blown with great success. To the right of us I saw the captain of a junk chop away his mooring line with an axe and spring to help his crew at the hoisting of the huge, outlandish lug-sail. But to the left the first heads were popping up from below on another junk,",0,
"Dear Journal,

It has been a while since I last poured my heart out onto these pages, but today I feel the need to reflect on the challenges I have faced as a single parent and the difficult decisions I have made regarding the fathers of my children. The road has been rocky, filled with regrets and uncertainties, but also with determination and unwavering love for my sons, Matthew and Jonathan.

Let me begin with Matthew's father, Billy Jo Hatch. I met him when I was just a naive and boy-crazy teenager. Looking back, I realize how easily I fell for his charms, his confidence, and that air of adventure that surrounded him. Our time together was a whirlwind, passionate and reckless. In the summer of 1997, I made the impulsive decision to run away from home and seek refuge with Billy and his mother. It was a period of boredom and rebellion, as my dear friend Kimberly was away in Nebraska. I was lost in his world, naively believing that it was better than the one I had left behind. But the truth soon emerged - Billy was not the responsible partner I needed, nor the father figure my child deserved. He had his own demons to battle, and I couldn't risk my child's safety and happiness by staying with him. So, with a heavy heart and an ocean of tears, I made the difficult decision to leave him and return home.

The journey back wasn't easy. I carried the weight of guilt and shame, telling my family a twisted version of the truth, implying that Billy had been abusive toward me. It wasn't entirely false - he had become emotionally and verbally abusive at times. But I twisted the story, exaggerating the truth to protect myself and my child. Looking back, I sometimes wonder if I made the right choice. If I had been more honest, would things have turned out differently? But I quickly remind myself that I did what I believed was best for my child, even if it meant resorting to lies.

On April 15th, 1998, after a long and arduous labor, I gave birth to my firstborn, Eric Matthew Yates. Billy's presence in my life grew fainter with each passing day, and the last time I saw him was in July of that year. He claimed he was getting better, that he wanted to be a father, but deep down, I knew he wasn't ready to grow up and take on the responsibilities of parenthood. And so, with a heavy heart laden with uncertainty, I carried on, determined to provide my child with the love, security, and stability he deserved.

Now, let me reflect on Jonathan's father, Donald Ralph Springer Jr. He was my high school sweetheart, and we shared many cherished memories. But our love was tumultuous and fiery, filled with passionate fights and endless make-ups. When I made the decision to quit school in October of 1996, our relationship suffered. We lost touch, and life went on without each other. However, fate had a different plan for us. After a car accident in November 2000, I started having strange feelings, anxiety attacks that shook me to the core. It was in that moment of vulnerability that I realized life was too short, that I didn't want to live with regrets. So I set out on a mission to find Donnie, to reconnect and rekindle what we once had. And that's exactly what happened.

But we made a grave mistake. Instead of starting anew, we picked up where we left off, assuming that time had not changed us. It was a foolish decision, driven by our longing for what once was. In September of 2001, I discovered that I was pregnant again. This time, however, Donnie did not share my joy. He didn't want the pregnancy to continue, and his opposition shook me to my core. It was a painful blow, but I knew in my heart that I couldn't consider an abortion. The love for my unborn child was undeniable, and I couldn't betray that bond. Our relationship deteriorated rapidly after that revelation, and I knew I had to make yet another difficult decision for the sake of my children.

On the 4th of May, 2002, I gave birth to my second son, Jonathan Michael Yates. The labor was quick and intense, and through it all, my mother stood by my side, supporting me through the pain and uncertainties. As I watch my children grow up so fast, I can't help but wonder what would have happened if their fathers had been ready to step up and be a part of their lives. Did I make the right decisions? Was I wrong about their readiness? These are questions that haunt me in the darkest hours of the night, filling my mind with doubt and regret. But ultimately, I know that my children come first. Their happiness and well-being are my top priorities. I want them to have stable and loving environments, where they can grow and flourish without the chaos and uncertainty of absent fathers.

Being a single parent is no easy feat. It is a role that comes with immense challenges, exhaustion, and moments of doubt. But through it all, I am determined to provide my sons with the love, support, and opportunities they deserve. They are truly my miracles, my guiding lights in this chaotic world. And so, I will continue to make the tough choices, to sacrifice",1,
"everywhere. ""Thirty minutes out of Litchfield, sir,"" the ship's officer repeated. ""You'll go off by the midship gangway on the starboard side."" ""Yes, I know. Thank you."" The first mate held out the clipboard he was carrying. ""Would you mind checking over this, Mr. Maxwell? Your baggage list."" ""Certainly."" He glanced at the slip of paper. Valises, eighteen and twenty-five kilos, two; trunks, seventy-five and seventy kilos, two; microbook case, one-fifty kilos, one. The last item fanned up a little flicker of anger in him, not at any person, even himself, but at the situation in which he found himself and the futility of the whole thing. ""Yes, that's everything. I have no hand-luggage, just this stuff."" He noticed that this was the only baggage list under the clip; the other papers were all freight and express manifests. ""Not many passengers left aboard, are there?"" ""You're the only one in first-class, sir,"" the mate replied. ""About forty farm-laborers on the lower deck. Everybody else got off at the other stops. Litchfield's the end of the run. You know anything about the place?"" ""I was born there. I've been away at school for the last five years."" ""On Baldur?"" ""Terra. University of Montevideo."" Once Conn would have said it almost boastfully. The mate gave him a quick look of surprised respect, then grinned and nodded. ""Of course; I should have known. You're Rodney Maxwell's son, aren't you? Your father's one of our regular freight shippers. Been sending out a lot of stuff lately."" He looked as though he would have liked to continue the conversation, but said: ""Sorry, I've got to go. Lot of things to attend to before landing."" He touched the visor of his cap and turned away. The mountains were closer when Conn looked forward again, and he glanced down. Five years and two space voyages ago, seen from the afterdeck of this ship or one of her sisters, the woods had been green with new foliage, and the wine-melon fields had been in pink blossom. He tried to picture the scene sliding away below instead of drawing in toward him, as though to force himself back to a moment of the irretrievable past. But the moment was gone, and with it the eager excitement and the half-formed anticipations of the things he would learn and accomplish on Terra. The things he would learn--microbook case, one-fifty kilos, one. One of the steel trunks was full of things he had learned and accomplished, too. Maybe they, at least, had some value.... The woods were autumn-tinted now and the fields were bare and brown. They had gotten the crop in early this year, for the fields had all been harvested. Those workers below must be going out for the wine-pressing. That extra hands were needed for that meant a big crop, and yet it seemed that less land was under cultivation than when he had gone away. He could see squares of low brush among the new forests that had grown up in the last forty years, and the few stands of original timber looked like hills above the second growth. Those trees had been standing when the planet had been colonized. That had been two hundred years ago, at the middle of the Seventh Century, Atomic Era. The name of the planet--Poictesme--told that: the Surromanticist Movement, when the critics and professors were rediscovering James Branch Cabell. * * * * * Funny how much was coming back to him now--things he had picked up from the minimal liberal-arts and general-humanities courses he had taken and then forgotten in his absorption with the science and tech studies. The first extrasolar planets, as they had been discovered, had been named from Norse mythology--Odin and Baldur and Thor, Uller and Freya, Bifrost and Asgard and Niflheim. When the Norse names ran out, the discoverers had turned to other mythologies, Celtic and Egyptian and Hindu and Assyrian, and by the middle of the Seventh Century they were naming planets for almost anything. Anything, that is, but actual persons; their names were reserved for stars. Like Alpha Gartner, the sun of Poictesme, and Beta Gartner, a buckshot-sized pink glow in the southeast, and Gamma Gartner, out of sight on the other side of the world, all named for old Genji Gartner, the scholarly and half-piratical adventurer whose ship had been the first to approach the three stars and discover that each of them had planets. Forty-two planets in all, from a couple of methane-giants on Gamma to airless little things with one-sixth Terran gravity. Alpha II had been the only one in the Trisystem with an oxygen atmosphere and life. So Gartner had landed on it, and named it Poictesme, and the settlement that had grown up around the first landing site had been called Storisende. Thirty years later, Genji Gartner died there, after seeing the camp grow to a metropolis, and was buried under a massive monument. Some of the other planets had been rich in metals, and mines had been opened, and atmosphere-domed factories and processing plants built. None of them could produce anything but hydroponic and tissue-culture foodstuffs, and natural foods from Poictesme had been less expensive, even on the planets of Gamma and Beta. So Poictesme had concentrated on agriculture and grown wealthy at it. Then, within fifty years of Genji Gartner's death, the economics of interstellar trade overtook the Trisystem and the mines and factories closed down. It was no longer possible to ship the output to a profitable market, in the face of the growing self-sufficiency of the colonial planets and the irreducibly high cost of space-freighting. Below, the brown fields and the red and yellow woods were merging into a ten-mile-square desert of crumbling concrete--empty and roofless sheds and warehouses and barracks, brush-choked parade grounds and landing fields, airship docks, and even a spaceport. They were more recent, dating from Poictesme's second brief and hectic prosperity, when the Terran Federation's Third Fleet-Army Force had occupied the Gartner",0,
"A Fau de Verzy is either a Dwarf Beech (Fagus sylvatica variety tortuosa), a dwarf oak tree, or a dwarf chestnut tree. These grow in the forest of Verzy, 25 km south of Reims in France. In this forest are less than a thousand dwarf beeches, some dozen dwarf oaks and some dwarf chestnuts (see Biology below), but this article speaks in the main about dwarf beeches. The word fau designated the beech in Old French (the plural was faux); this word came from the Latin fagus, now the French word for beech is hêtre that has a Germanic origin. These trees therefore give the name, Les Faux de Verzy, to the touristic area located in France 25 km south of Reims in Marne where the world’s largest concentration of dwarf beeches stands with about a thousand trees. They are not more than 4 or 5 metres (13 or 16 ft) high. In summer, they spread their leaves like heavy sun umbrellas; some looking like leaf igloos. In winter, their tortuous shape can be seen naked: trunks and branches are crooked, bent, twisted and pendulous to the ground. Such dwarf beeches are also known in other places: in Germany (in the Süntel area, not far from Hanover), in Sweden (at Dalby Söderskog National Park near Malmö, not far from the northern limit for this species), in Denmark, and in another place in France (in Lorraine). Nobody knows whether these plantings have the same origin or not. But there are too few such beeches in these two places to feel confident about the future of their population. The situation is healthier around the dwarf beeches of Verzy, especially now that the construction of a pathway enables visitors to admire them without making harmful trampling on the ground over the fragile roots. A fenced reserve also enables the preservation of a part of the population. With more than 1,000 dwarf beeches, the National Forest of Verzy is the world's principal reserve of dwarf beeches. Among them, the most specific ones were given a name inspired by their peculiar shapes: •the umbrella Fau, •the Fau of the bride, •the ox-head Fau, •the Fau of the Young Lady (the legend says that Joan of Arc came and had a rest in this forest). This area has been listed at a national level since 1932. A fau of Verzy in winter ... in spring ... in autumn ... in summer A mass of speculation, from far-fetched to more credible, but often scientifically unfounded, have been put forward to explain the origin of the Faux of Verzy. It is known that there were already some “Faux” in the forest of Verzy thanks to old books written in the abbey of St-Basle during the 6th century. The monks may have increased their number by layering and then by transplanting them in the forest to make a kind of “botanical garden”. These monks were great travellers and, according to Y. Bernard they may have brought back a treasured young plant from an eastern area that they were passing through for evangelizing. A dwarf beech called abre des Dames (abre standing for arbre meaning tree, and dame meaning fairy at that time) which together gives ‘’the tree of the fairies’’ stood in the south of Domrémy-la-Pucelle, the native village of Joan of Arc. This beech was already one hundred years old at that time; it was venerated because of its beauty and was the subject of rural worship: a procession used to walk there every year to chase away the bad spirits. During Joan of Arc’s trial of rehabilitation (1450-1456), 11 witnesses spoke about this very tree as if it was an essential piece of information. It was said that when going with Charles VII of France to the abbey of St Basle, Joan of Arc climbed up in the branches of a fau at Verzy and sat down. True or not, the story shows the swarm of legends which had surrounded these dwarf beeches that still are a mystery for the scientists. The dwarf beech trees belong to the family Fagaceae as the usual common beech trees do. Their distinctive features are, apart from their shape: A genetic mutation is now the most probable hypothesis to explain the dwarf aspect of these trees. This mutation may have occurred spontaneously or could have been introduced by a pathogenic agent centuries ago, the mutation would be stable and hereditary. Friedrich Lange proposes the hypothesis of a recessive mutation. He based this conclusion on the appearance inside a forest of common beech trees in the neighborhood of an old colonisation of disappeared dwarf beech trees of spontaneous seedling of dwarf trees. According to Lange, that is an out turn of the recessive characteristic actual in heterozygote coming from a common beech. The hypothesis of a temporary adaptation (Accommodat in French) due to the local environment, still frequently in favour in the area, can’t be taken on because this adaptation is not genetically stable; the dwarf beeches, when they are transplanted from Verzy to other environments or when they are grafted on a common beech tree keep their dwarf tree aspect. The earth of Verzy is poor for agriculture. Could this have led to a lineage of a distinct phenotype? No, because many beeches there are not dwarf beeches. The hypothesis of a pathogen which may have induced a mutation is compatible with the fact that there are some dwarf oak trees Quercus petraea and some dwarf chest nut trees Castanea sativa or sweet chestnut. Nevertheless, the photonic and electronic analysis with transmission carried out by J. C. Audran in 1985 failed in discovering an active presence of virus or of mollicutes (a class of small bacteria). Year after year, even stranger trees are found in this area; these ones look globally as dwarf beech trees but with a branch growing as it would do in a common beech tree. These stranger trees seem to be more frequent, they are called chimera",0,
"Adélard Joseph François-Arthur Boucher, a remarkable figure in Canadian history, left an indelible mark on the realms of music, publishing, and numismatics. Born on April 2, 1881, in the city of Montreal, Adélard Boucher would go on to become a celebrated composer, a successful publisher, and a respected numismatist.

Boucher's journey in the music industry began at a young age. His fascination with music and his innate talent soon became apparent. He studied piano and composition under the guidance of renowned Canadian composers such as Guillaume Couture and Joseph Vézina. His dedication and passion for music fueled his ambition to create his own compositions.

In the early 1900s, Boucher established himself as a composer, with his works gaining recognition both in Canada and beyond. His compositions were characterized by their melodic beauty and intricate harmonies, showcasing his mastery of the craft. Boucher's music often drew inspiration from Canadian landscapes and cultural heritage, reflecting his deep love for his homeland.

However, Boucher's artistic pursuits extended beyond composing. In 1903, he founded his own publishing company, Les Éditions Adélard Boucher, with the aim of promoting Canadian composers and their music. The publishing house quickly gained a reputation for its commitment to showcasing Canadian talent and supporting the development of classical music in Canada. Through his publishing company, Boucher not only published his own compositions but also those of many other Canadian composers, helping to elevate their work to a wider audience.

One of Boucher's notable achievements as a publisher was the establishment of the ""Concours des jeunes artistes"" (Contest for Young Artists) in 1912. This competition served as a platform for young Canadian musicians to showcase their talents and gain recognition. Through this initiative, Boucher actively contributed to nurturing and encouraging emerging musical talent in Canada.

Boucher's love for music was equaled by his passion for numismatics, the study and collection of coins and currency. Alongside his musical endeavors, he became deeply involved in the field of numismatics, amassing an extensive collection of coins and currency from around the world. His collection included rare and unique pieces that showcased the rich history of various civilizations.

Furthermore, Boucher's expertise in numismatics led him to actively contribute to the field. He published several articles and books on the subject, sharing his knowledge and helping to expand the understanding of numismatics in Canada. Boucher's contributions to numismatics were recognized by his appointment as a Fellow of the Royal Numismatic Society in London, England.

Throughout his life, Adélard Joseph François-Arthur Boucher demonstrated unwavering dedication and passion for the arts. His contributions to the music industry as a composer and publisher, as well as his involvement in numismatics, have left a lasting legacy. Boucher's commitment to Canadian talent and his efforts to promote and preserve cultural heritage have contributed significantly to the growth and development of these fields. His imprint on Canada's artistic and academic communities remains an inspiration to aspiring musicians, publishers, and numismatists alike.",1,

"greet us, to show us their hospitality. They didn't realize that humans had changed, that our values had evolved. We saw them as primitive, as less than us. We saw an opportunity for conquest, for colonization. And we took it.

Doran and I were young and idealistic then, just fresh out of the Conqueror Corps training. We bought into the propaganda, the idea that we were spreading civilization to the stars. We bought into the idea that we were superior, that we had the right to dominate and control other worlds.

But as we mingled with the Venusians, as we learned their language and their way of life, something inside us began to change. We saw their humanity, their beauty, and their love for their planet. We realized that conquering them would be an act of cruelty and injustice.

So we made a pact. We were going to betray our mission, to help the Venusians protect themselves from Earth's greed. We were going to give them a fighting chance, a voice to defend their home.

But we were discovered. The rest of the crew saw us as traitors, as threats to their vision of glory and power. Doran was killed, and I was left behind, on the fringes of Mars, where they thought I'd be forgotten.

But I wasn't forgotten. The mountain on Mars, the one that pointed an accusing finger at Earth, became my refuge. It was a constant reminder of what I had lost, of the injustice we had committed. And now, the crew was planning to climb it, to explore its mysteries. They thought they were conquering, but all they were doing was perpetuating the cycle of violence and domination.

I watched as they prepared for the climb, each of them driven by their hunger for conquest. Anhauser, with his brute strength, believed that physical power was the ultimate measure of worth. Jacobs, with his cunning, believed that manipulation and control were the keys to success. They were blind to the lessons I had learned, to the pain and regret that haunted me.

As they departed, I stayed behind, walking the barren surface of Mars, gazing up at the accusing mountain. It seemed to call out to me, asking me to confront my past, to make amends for the violence I had been a part of. I knew I couldn't undo what had been done, but I could refuse to be a part of the never-ending cycle of conquest and destruction.

With each step, I felt a weight lift off my shoulders. The burden of guilt and disillusionment began to dissipate, replaced by a sense of purpose and determination. I couldn't change the world, but I could change myself. I could live a life guided by compassion and empathy, a life that honored the beauty of every being, no matter how different or ""primitive"" they may seem.

And so, as the crew reached the summit of the mountain, they discovered not just a barren landscape, but a mirror reflecting their own insatiable thirst for power. They realized that conquest had no true purpose, no lasting fulfillment. They realized that their mission had been fueled by greed and ignorance.

As they descended, their faces wore a different expression. Anhauser, once filled with arrogance, now carried a look of humility. Jacobs, once consumed by his hunger for control, now showed signs of remorse. They had seen the truth, and it had shattered their illusions.

When they returned to the shelter, I was there, waiting for them. No longer disillusioned, but filled with a newfound hope. I didn't hate them for what they had done; I pitied them. And I offered them the opportunity to change, to let go of their thirst for conquest and embrace a different path.

Some of them scoffed, unable to let go of their old ways. But others listened, their eyes searching for something more. And in that moment, I knew that the cycle of conquest and domination could be broken, one person at a time.

The Accusing Mountain remained on Mars, its presence a constant reminder of the choices we make, of the consequences of our actions. And I, Bruce, once disillusioned and burdened by guilt, found solace in the knowledge that change was possible, that redemption was within reach.

As the years passed, I left Mars behind, returning to Earth with a renewed sense of purpose. I became an advocate for the rights of indigenous peoples, fighting against the injustices of colonization and exploitation. And though my past haunted me, I used it as fuel to drive me forward, to make amends for the mistakes I had made.

The Accusing Mountain stood tall on Mars, its silent presence a reminder of the responsibility we carry as stewards of the universe. And as its accusing finger pointed towards Earth, I vowed to dedicate my life to ensure that we learn from our past, that we choose empathy and compassion over conquest and greed.

For it is in the depths of our darkest moments that we can find the strength to rise, to change, and to create a future that embraces the beauty of all beings, no matter how different or ""primitive"" they may seem. And it is in the face of injustice that we can find the courage to fight for what is right, to build a world that is based on respect and understanding.

The Accusing Mountain will forever stand as a testament to the power of choice, to the capacity",1,
"Real-time computer graphics or real-time rendering is the sub-field of computer graphics focused on producing and analyzing images in real time. The term can refer to anything from rendering an application's graphical user interface (GUI) to real-time image analysis, but is most often used in reference to interactive 3D computer graphics, typically using a graphics processing unit (GPU). One example of this concept is a video game that rapidly renders changing 3D environments to produce an illusion of motion. Computers have been capable of generating 2D images such as simple lines, images and polygons in real time since their invention. However, quickly rendering detailed 3D objects is a daunting task for traditional Von Neumann architecture-based systems. An early workaround to this problem was the use of sprites, 2D images that could imitate 3D graphics. Different techniques for rendering now exist, such as ray-tracing and rasterization. Using these techniques and advanced hardware, computers can now render images quickly enough to create the illusion of motion while simultaneously accepting user input. This means that the user can respond to rendered images in real time, producing an interactive experience. The goal of computer graphics is to generate computer-generated images, or frames, using certain desired metrics. One such metric is the number of frames generated in a given second. Real-time computer graphics systems differ from traditional (i.e., non-real-time) rendering systems in that non-real-time graphics typically rely on ray tracing. In this process, millions or billions of rays are traced from the camera to the world for detailed rendering—this expensive operation can take hours or days to render a single frame. Real-time graphics systems must render each image in less than 1/30th of a second. Ray tracing is far too slow for these systems; instead, they employ the technique of z-buffer triangle rasterization. In this technique, every object is decomposed into individual primitives, usually triangles. Each triangle gets positioned, rotated and scaled on the screen, and rasterizer hardware (or a software emulator) generates pixels inside each triangle. These triangles are then decomposed into atomic units called fragments that are suitable for displaying on a display screen. The fragments are drawn on the screen using a color that is computed in several steps. For example, a texture can be used to ""paint"" a triangle based on a stored image, and then shadow mapping can alter that triangle's colors based on line-of-sight to light sources. Real-time graphics optimizes image quality subject to time and hardware constraints. GPUs and other advances increased the image quality that real-time graphics can produce. GPUs are capable of handling millions of triangles per frame, and current[when?] DirectX 11/OpenGL 4.x class hardware is capable of generating complex effects, such as shadow volumes, motion blurring, and triangle generation, in real-time. The advancement of real-time graphics is evidenced in the progressive improvements between actual gameplay graphics and the pre-rendered cutscenes traditionally found in video games.[1] Cutscenes are typically rendered in real-time—and may be interactive.[2] Although the gap in quality between real-time graphics and traditional off-line graphics is narrowing, offline rendering remains much more accurate. Real-time graphics are typically employed when interactivity (e.g., player feedback) is crucial. When real-time graphics are used in films, the director has complete control of what has to be drawn on each frame, which can sometimes involve lengthy decision-making. Teams of people are typically involved in the making of these decisions. In real-time computer graphics, the user typically operates an input device to influence what is about to be drawn on the display. For example, when the user wants to move a character on the screen, the system updates the character's position before drawing the next frame. Usually, the display's response-time is far slower than the input device—this is justified by the immense difference between the (fast) response time of a human being's motion and the (slow) perspective speed of the human visual system. This difference has other effects too: because input devices must be very fast to keep up with human motion response, advancements in input devices (e.g., the current[when?] Wii remote) typically take much longer to achieve than comparable advancements in display devices. Another important factor controlling real-time computer graphics is the combination of physics and animation. These techniques largely dictate what is to be drawn on the screen—especially where to draw objects in the scene. These techniques help realistically imitate real world behavior (the temporal dimension, not the spatial dimensions), adding to the computer graphics' degree of realism. Real-time previewing with graphics software, especially when adjusting lighting effects, can increase work speed.[3] Some parameter adjustments in fractal generating software may be made while viewing changes to the image in real time. The graphics rendering pipeline (""rendering pipeline"" or simply ""pipeline"") is the foundation of real-time graphics.[4] Its main function is to render a two-dimensional image in relation to a virtual camera, three-dimensional objects (an object that has width, length, and depth), light sources, lighting models, textures and more. The architecture of the real-time rendering pipeline can be divided into conceptual stages: application, geometry and rasterization. The application stage is responsible for generating ""scenes"", or 3D settings that are drawn to a 2D display. This stage is implemented in software that developers optimize for performance. This stage may perform processing such as collision detection, speed-up techniques, animation and force feedback, in addition to handling user input. Collision detection is an example of an operation that would be performed in the application stage. Collision detection uses algorithms to detect and respond to collisions between (virtual) objects. For example, the application may calculate new positions for the colliding objects and provide feedback via a force feedback device such as a vibrating game controller. The application stage also prepares graphics data for the next stage. This includes texture animation, animation of 3D models, animation via transforms, and geometry morphing. Finally, it produces primitives (points, lines, and triangles) based on scene information and feeds those primitives into the geometry stage of the pipeline. The geometry stage manipulates polygons and vertices to compute what",0,
"Have you ever wondered how well you truly know the people around you? I often find myself contemplating the limits of human knowledge and understanding. Is it possible for us to truly know another person completely, or are there inherent limitations in our ability to do so?

To explore this question further, I reached out to a variety of individuals with different perspectives. I spoke to a memory expert, a philosopher, a priest, and a psychologist, seeking their insights on the matter. Their responses were thought-provoking, and shed light on the complex nature of human knowledge.

The memory expert I spoke to emphasized the fallibility of our memory. He argued that even with the best of intentions, our recollection of events and people can be distorted over time. He pointed out that our memories are often influenced by emotions, biases, and personal experiences, making it difficult to truly know someone based solely on our recollection of interactions with them.

On the other hand, the philosopher I spoke to questioned the very concept of ""knowing"" someone. He argued that human beings are ever-evolving, complex beings, and therefore cannot be completely known or understood. He proposed that the concept of ""knowing"" another person is an illusion, as we can only know a snapshot of who they are at a given moment in time. According to him, it is impossible to truly comprehend the depths of another person's thoughts, emotions, and experiences.

In contrast to these perspectives, the priest I spoke to held a more spiritual viewpoint. He believed that while our human understanding may have its limitations, there is a divine presence that transcends our human capacity for knowledge. He argued that through spiritual connection and faith, one can come to know others on a deeper level, beyond what is immediately perceptible. For him, true knowledge of others lies not in the physical realm but in the realm of the intangible.

Lastly, the psychologist I consulted approached the question from a scientific standpoint. She pointed out that our ability to know another person is influenced by social factors, such as the depth of the relationship, the time spent together, and the level of intimacy shared. She suggested that we can know certain individuals more deeply than others, but that there will always be limits to our understanding. She also highlighted the importance of empathy and active listening in enhancing our ability to know others, as it allows us to connect with them on a more profound level.

Reflecting on these insights, it becomes clear that there are inherent limitations to our knowledge and understanding of others. Our memories may be unreliable, our comprehension may be limited by our ever-changing nature, and there may be intangible aspects of others that are beyond our grasp. Yet, despite these limitations, our relationships and connections with others can still be meaningful and impactful.

So, what does this mean for us in our daily lives? Should we give up on truly knowing others? Perhaps not. While we may never fully understand another person, the pursuit of knowledge and understanding is still worthwhile. It is through our interactions, conversations, and shared experiences that we can come to appreciate the complexities and nuances of the human condition.

Ultimately, the question of how many people one can truly know remains unanswered. The limitations of our human knowledge and understanding are vast, but it is within these boundaries that we can find beauty, mystery, and the potential for genuine connection.",1,
"phantom conjured from its leather. The Professor's Wife, always a perceptive hostess, came to her husband's rescue by saying with equal rapidity, ""Top of the stairs, end of the hall, last door."" The Martian's mouth curled happily downward and he said, ""Thank you very much,"" and was off. Comprehension burst on the Professor. He caught up with his guest at the foot of the stairs. ""Here, I'll show you the way,"" he said. ""No, I can find it myself, thank you,"" the Martian assured him. * * * * * Something rather final in the Martian's tone made the Professor desist, and after watching his visitor sway up the stairs with an almost hypnotic softly jogging movement, he rejoined his wife in the study, saying wonderingly, ""Who'd have thought it, by George! Function taboos as strict as our own!"" ""I'm glad some of your professional visitors maintain 'em,"" his wife said darkly. ""But this one's from Mars, darling, and to find out he's--well, similar in an aspect of his life is as thrilling as the discovery that water is burned hydrogen. When I think of the day not far distant when I'll put his entries in the cross-cultural index ..."" He was still rhapsodizing when the Professor's Little Son raced in. ""Pop, the Martian's gone to the bathroom!"" ""Hush, dear. Manners."" ""Now it's perfectly natural, darling, that the boy should notice and be excited. Yes, Son, the Martian's not so very different from us."" ""Oh, certainly,"" the Professor's Wife said with a trace of bitterness. ""I don't imagine his turquoise complexion will cause any comment at all when you bring him to a faculty reception. They'll just figure he's had a hard night--and that he got that baby-elephant nose sniffing around for assistant professorships."" ""Really, darling! He probably thinks of our noses as disagreeably amputated and paralyzed."" ""Well, anyway, Pop, he's in the bathroom. I followed him when he squiggled upstairs."" ""Now, Son, you shouldn't have done that. He's on a strange planet and it might make him nervous if he thought he was being spied on. We must show him every courtesy. By George, I can't wait to discuss these things with Ackerly-Ramsbottom! When I think of how much more this encounter has to give the anthropologist than even the physicist or astronomer ..."" [Illustration] He was still going strong on his second rhapsody when he was interrupted by another high-speed entrance. It was the Professor's Coltish Daughter. ""Mom, Pop, the Martian's--"" ""Hush, dear. We know."" The Professor's Coltish Daughter regained her adolescent poise, which was considerable. ""Well, he's still in there,"" she said. ""I just tried the door and it was locked."" ""I'm glad it was!"" the Professor said while his wife added, ""Yes, you can't be sure what--"" and caught herself. ""Really, dear, that was very bad manners."" ""I thought he'd come downstairs long ago,"" her daughter explained. ""He's been in there an awfully long time. It must have been a half hour ago that I saw him gyre and gimbal upstairs in that real gone way he has, with Nosy here following him."" The Professor's Coltish Daughter was currently soaking up both jive and _Alice_. * * * * * When the Professor checked his wristwatch, his expression grew troubled. ""By George, he is taking his time! Though, of course, we don't know how much time Martians ... I wonder."" ""I listened for a while, Pop,"" his son volunteered. ""He was running the water a lot."" ""Running the water, eh? We know Mars is a water-starved planet. I suppose that in the presence of unlimited water, he might be seized by a kind of madness and ... But he seemed so well adjusted."" Then his wife spoke, voicing all their thoughts. Her outlook on life gave her a naturally sepulchral voice. ""_What's he doing in there?_"" Twenty minutes and at least as many fantastic suggestions later, the Professor glanced again at his watch and nerved himself for action. Motioning his family aside, he mounted the stairs and tiptoed down the hall. He paused only once to shake his head and mutter under his breath, ""By George, I wish I had Fenchurch or von Gottschalk here. They're a shade better than I am on intercultural contracts, especially taboo-breakings and affronts ..."" His family followed him at a short distance. The Professor stopped in front of the bathroom door. Everything was quiet as death. He listened for a minute and then rapped measuredly, steadying his hand by clutching its wrist with the other. There was a faint splashing, but no other sound. Another minute passed. The Professor rapped again. Now there was no response at all. He very gingerly tried the knob. The door was still locked. When they had retreated to the stairs, it was the Professor's Wife who once more voiced their thoughts. This time her voice carried overtones of supernatural horror. ""_What's he doing in there?_"" ""He may be dead or dying,"" the Professor's Coltish Daughter suggested briskly. ""Maybe we ought to call the Fire Department, like they did for old Mrs. Frisbee."" The Professor winced. ""I'm afraid you haven't visualized the complications, dear,"" he said gently. ""No one but ourselves knows that the Martian is on Earth, or has even the slightest inkling that interplanetary travel has been achieved. Whatever we do, it will have to be on our own. But to break in on a creature engaged in--well, we don't know what primal private activity--is against all anthropological practice. Still--"" ""Dying's a primal activity,"" his daughter said crisply. ""So's ritual bathing before mass murder,"" his wife added. ""Please! Still, as I was about to say, we do have the moral duty to succor him if, as you all too reasonably suggest, he has been incapacitated by a germ or virus or, more likely, by some simple environmental factor such as Earth's greater gravity."" ""Tell you what, Pop--I can look in the bathroom window and see what he's doing. All I have to do",0,
"Martin Devere had grown accustomed to the solitude and tranquility of his life on Mars. For over three decades, he had embraced the role of a hermit, seeking refuge from the chaos and demands of Earth. With each passing year, his routines and rituals had become a familiar comfort, grounding him in his solitary existence.

But one fateful day, as Martin was meticulously unloading supplies from the cargo ship, his routine was disrupted by a sight he never anticipated. In the distance, he caught a glimpse of a descending rocket, its engines ablaze, creating a brilliant streak of light against the crimson Martian sky. Intrigued, his curiosity ignited like the fuel that propelled the rocket downwards.

As the rocket approached, Martin's senses heightened. He could feel a mixture of excitement and trepidation bubbling within him. He observed a sandcat - a sleek and agile rover - approaching alongside two figures clad in space suits. The sandcat moved gracefully through the Mars terrain, creating a trail of red dust in its wake.

Martin's mind raced with questions. Who were these unexpected visitors? What brought them to Mars? And most importantly, what were their intentions? He had spent years intentionally distancing himself from Earth, leaving behind a troubled past and seeking solace in the barren landscape of the Red Planet. Now, it seemed that his sanctuary might be invaded.

As the sandcat neared, Martin could see the glint of curiosity in the visitors' eyes behind the glass visors of their helmets. He cautiously approached them, the sand crunching beneath his boots. His heart pounded in his chest, a medley of fear and anticipation. The astronauts halted the sandcat, and one of them spoke through a radio transmitter.

""Martin Devere?"" the voice crackled, carrying a mix of surprise and excitement.

Martin nodded, his voice betraying his perplexity. ""Yes, that's me. Who are you? What brings you here?""

The astronaut removed his helmet, revealing a face etched with lines of experience and a hint of excitement. ""My name is Commander James Anderson. We've been sent by the International Space Exploration Agency to make contact with you, Martin. We've heard of your presence here and deemed it appropriate to check on you.""

Martin's mind whirled with a mix of emotions. He had grown used to the solitude, finding solace in the emptiness of the Martian landscape. He never expected to encounter others on this desolate planet, let alone be the subject of interest for an international agency.

Commander Anderson continued, a friendly smile edging across his lips. ""We wanted to ensure your well-being and offer our assistance, should you need it. We've brought some supplies and equipment, in case you require any upgrades or repairs.""

Martin's initial suspicion began to wane as he assessed the genuine concern in Commander Anderson's voice. He realized that perhaps these visitors weren't intruders but allies, reaching out a helping hand in an isolated corner of the universe.

""Thank you,"" Martin replied, his voice laced with gratitude and relief. ""I've managed well on my own, but upgrades and repairs wouldn't go amiss. And it's been a long time since I've spoken to anyone.""

As the days turned into weeks, Commander Anderson and his team became a welcome presence in Martin's life. They exchanged stories, shared discoveries, and collaborated on projects to make Martin's Mars outpost more efficient and habitable. The once-hermit began to feel a renewed sense of connection to the world beyond Mars, realizing that human companionship was a vital aspect of his existence.

Over time, Martin's relationship with the unexpected visitors blossomed into a friendship built on mutual respect and shared experiences. They became his link to the world he had left behind, providing him with updates on Earth's happenings and sharing the marvels of technological advancements.

In the years that followed, more astronauts would visit Martin's outpost on Mars, forming a close-knit community that thrived on camaraderie and the pursuit of knowledge. Together, they expanded the boundaries of human exploration, fostering a spirit of collaboration and adventure while carving out a new chapter in the history of humanity.

And as Martin Devere looked up at the Martian night sky, he realized that while he had indeed been a hermit, the arrival of unexpected visitors had opened his heart to the infinite possibilities that lay beyond his hermitage. Mars was no longer a solitary sanctuary; it was now a bridge connecting him to the wider universe.",1,
"I first met Dustin at a gay dance club in L.A. I had just broken up with my long time boyfriend of three years, and I was heart broken. He was the first and only guy I have ever been in love with. I had been sitting in my apartment for the last week, slowly empting my liquor cabinet of its contents. Everyone knows that alcohol solves all of your problems. Around five that night, my good friend Jack came over to tell me that enough was enough, and it was time to get my pathetic ass up and have some fun. I asked him why he couldn’t just let me wallow in my self-pity, didn’t I deserve that much? He said no, not when it meant that my hair looked like a dead, greasy animal that had been glued to the top of my head. “Where have those soft, gorgeous locks gone to, Jasmine?” He asked me. Yes, Jack is gay. He firmly told me that I had one hour to get myself fabulous looking, and then he would be back to take me out with a bunch of his stunningly gay friends. I was informed that there would be nothing better for me than going out on the town and discussing what an ass my old boyfriend was with a group of sympathetic gay men. Before I could even protest, he had me in the shower. I was going whether I liked it or not. Exactly an hour later, he was back. When I came to the door, he told me I looked absolutely stunning, and that if he wasn’t such a homo, he would have sex with me right there. I couldn’t help smiling. He introduced me to the four guys he had brought with him, and they all agreed that I had completely fabulous cheekbones. A lot more guys would get laid if they just acted gay. Jack hailed two taxis and told the driver to take us to Apache Territory. I asked him what that was. He said it was a gay dance club that he often frequented, and not to worry, he would make sure I had fun. He also informed me that some of the guys had wanted to take me to the Faultline Bar, but he had forbidden it. “You can thank me later,” he said. For all of those who don’t know, the Faultline Bar is basically mobs of gay men in latex rubber and leather, covered in tattoos and body piercings. At first I felt a little out of place on a dance floor full of fishnet clad men, but they were all just so friendly that I soon found myself enjoying the night immensely. I probably danced with 50 different gorgeous guys before Jack and I went to the bar to take a brake. Too bad they all thoroughly enjoy taking it in the ass. We both ordered a few shots of gin, and started to discuss this horribly sexy guy that Jack had just been dancing with. Why is it that the only good dancers are either black or gay? Straight, white men have nothing going for them. I bet Jack twenty dollars that he would get laid that night. I went home twenty dollars richer, and Jack went home happy. After a little while, Jack went back out to the dance floor to go pick up his guy, but I stayed at the bar. I was ordering another shot when a guy, who certainly would have been number one on what Jack liked to call his Men to Fuck and Remember Their Names list, sat down on the stool next to me. Feeling a little buzzed, I asked him why he wasn’t wearing something see-through and glittery. He quickly told me that he was a vagina man, and had only decided to come here, along with his friend, out of curiosity. He said he wanted to expand his horizons, meet a few interesting people. I informed him that I was an interesting person, and started a conversation about the time I had gotten really drunk and ended up having sex with my best friends boyfriend while she was passed out on the couch on the other side of the room, to prove my point. I knew I had him hooked. We decided to leave and go find a non-gay bar, and I went to find Jack to tell him. I found him standing in a dark corner, getting some serious action from his new friend, and decided not to bother him. Mr. Fuckable (I still didn’t know his name yet) and I walked a few blocks until we found a bar. He ordered himself and I a round of whisky shots and told me a few good stories about road trips he had taken and a wedding where the bride got really wasted the night before her wedding and ended up puking all over the groom in the middle of the ceremony the next day. Pretty soon we were making out and getting grotesquely physical in front of the entire bar. “The bathroom.” He whispered to me. I got up and followed him into the men’s room, where we proceeded to have quick and satisfying sex in a blue toilet stall. I know it was seriously nasty. I blame my whoreish behavior on my mother. She did tell me not to except candy from strangers, but she never said anything about having sex with them. It was only after we had finished the deed that I asked him his name, which turned out to be Dustin, the name I had picked out for my future son if I ever decided to have kids. That weirded me out a little. We walked out of the bathroom together, hand-in-hand, receiving a bunch of curious glances. I was happily enjoying this attention when Dustin screamed, “Holy Shit!” and pulled me down to the ground. Needless to say, I toppled over,",0,
"The Woman King is a 2022 American historical action-adventure film about the Agojie, the all-female warrior unit that protected the West African kingdom of Dahomey during the 17th to 19th centuries. Set in the 1820s, the film stars Viola Davis as a general who trains the next generation of warriors to fight their enemies. It is directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood and written by Dana Stevens, based on a story she wrote with Maria Bello. The film also stars Thuso Mbedu, Lashana Lynch, Sheila Atim, Hero Fiennes Tiffin, and John Boyega. Bello conceived the idea for The Woman King in 2015 after visiting Benin, where the kingdom used to be located, and learning the history of the Agojie. She recruited Cathy Schulman to develop it into a feature film, pitching it to several studios, who turned it down due to financial concerns. After they met with TriStar Pictures in 2017, the film was greenlit in 2020. Production began in South Africa in November 2021, shut down due to the COVID-19 Omicron variant a few weeks later, and resumed in early 2022. Polly Morgan was the cinematographer. During post-production, the musical score was composed by Terence Blanchard, and editing was completed by Terilyn A. Shropshire. The Woman King had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 9, 2022, and Sony Pictures Releasing released the film in theaters in the United States on September 16, 2022. Following the festival screening, the film received positive reviews from critics, with praise directed towards Davis's performance and the action choreography, though it received criticism for historical distortion of slavery.[5] At the 28th Critics' Choice Awards the film received nominations for Best Costume Design, Best Acting Ensemble, Best Director, and Best Actress for Davis. Furthermore, Davis also earned Best Actress nominations at the Golden Globes, Screen Actors Guild, BAFTA Film Awards, and NAACP Image Awards. It was the last film to be distributed by Entertainment One in Canada before the distributor's Canadian division was shut down on June 29, 2022 alongside with its Spanish distribution shortly before the film's release.[6] In the West African kingdom of Dahomey in 1823,[7] General Nanisca, leader of the all-female group of warriors, the Agojie, liberates Dahomean women who were abducted by slavers from the Oyo Empire. This provokes King Ghezo of Dahomey to prepare for an all-out war with the Oyo. Nanisca begins to train a new generation of warriors to join the Agojie to protect the kingdom. Among these warriors is Nawi, a strong-willed girl who was offered by her father to the king after refusing to marry men who would beat her. Nawi befriends Izogie, a veteran Agojie. She also reveals to Nanisca that she is adopted and shows a scar on her left shoulder, shocking Nanisca. Portuguese slave traders led by Santo Ferreira and accompanied by the half-Dahomean Malik arrive as part of an alliance with the Oyo, led by General Oba Ade. Nawi encounters Malik while the latter is bathing, and the two become friends. Shortly after graduating from training to become a full-fledged Agojie, Nawi sneaks off to speak with Malik and learns that the Oyo are planning to attack. She reports this to Nanisca, who tells her off for her recklessness. Amidst a heated argument between the two, Nanisca reveals that in her youth, she was captured by Oba, raped, and impregnated. After giving birth to a daughter, Nanisca embedded a shark tooth in her left shoulder before giving her away. Nanisca helps Nawi extract the tooth, confirming that she is her biological daughter. Nanisca leads the Agojie in an attack on the Oyo. The attack is successful, but Oba escapes and Nawi, Fumbe and Izogie are captured. With Nawi's advice, Fumbe escapes and reports the others' fate to Nanisca. Ghezo prepares to bestow the title of Woman King, his partner and equal in ruling Dahomey, upon Nanisca, but refuses to authorize a rescue mission for the captive Agojie. Meanwhile, Izogie is killed in an escape attempt and Malik buys Nawi to protect her. Nanisca defies orders and sets out with a group of like-minded warriors to rescue the captives. The chaos allows Nawi to escape and rejoin Nanisca. Malik frees several other slaves who drown Ferreira, and Nanisca kills Oba in single combat. The triumphant Agojie return to Dahomey, where Ghezo privately and briefly admonishes Nanisca for disobeying him, before crowning her the Woman King. After the festivities, Nanisca and Nawi privately acknowledge their familial relationship. The Woman King was produced by Maria Bello and Cathy Schulman, written by Dana Stevens with contributions by Gina Prince-Bythewood, and directed by Prince-Bythewood.[19] It is a co-production between TriStar Pictures and Entertainment One.[20] In 2015, Bello went to the West African nation of Benin to learn the history of the Agojie. Convinced she had found a story worth telling, she returned to Los Angeles and recruited Schulman, then head of organization Women in Film, to help her make the film.[2] On September 19, 2015,[21][22] Bello used a moment when she was presenting actress Viola Davis with an award at the Skirball Cultural Center in Los Angeles to pitch her idea for the movie in front of the crowd, who cheered at the notion of seeing Davis in the lead role.[19][2] Schulman first tried to set up the film at STX Films, where she was the head of the production, but the studio was only willing to offer an unsatisfactory $5 million.[23] After leaving STX in 2016, Schulman worked with Bello, Davis, and Julius Tennon, Davis's husband and producing partner at JuVee Productions, to take the idea elsewhere. Studios who turned it down cited an unlikely chance for the film to turn a profit; others, according to Davis, wanted to cast light-skinned, well-known actresses, which they refused to do for historical accuracy and the audience's sake. Prince-Bythewood, also in 2016, was approached to write the screenplay but could not commit due to a scheduling conflict with Silver & Black.[23][24] In 2017, without a script",0,
"Biking through Europe was a dream I had cherished for years. The idea of exploring different countries on two wheels, immersing myself in the local culture, and witnessing breathtaking landscapes filled my mind with excitement and anticipation. And so, with my backpack loaded and my trusty bike by my side, I embarked on a solo bike tour that would take me through some of the most incredible places in Europe.

My journey began in the charming city of Amsterdam, where I rented a bike and set off on the well-known cycling paths that crisscrossed the city. The feeling of riding alongside the picturesque canals, passing by narrow houses and vibrant flower markets, was simply magical. The city's flat terrain and bike-friendly infrastructure made it an ideal starting point for my adventure.

From Amsterdam, I pedaled my way through the Netherlands' countryside, reveling in the sight of windmills, tulip fields, and cozy little villages. The Dutch people, with their warm hospitality and love for cycling, were always ready to offer directions or strike up a conversation. It was through these interactions that I discovered hidden gems and local delicacies that I never would have stumbled upon otherwise.

As I crossed the border into Belgium, the landscape transformed into rolling green hills and charming medieval towns. Bruges, with its cobbled streets, canals, and fairy-tale-like architecture, captured my heart. The scent of freshly baked waffles and chocolate permeated the air, tempting me to indulge in these sinful treats. I couldn't resist trying some local beers too, as the Belgian beer culture is world-renowned.

Continuing my journey south, I reached the beautiful French countryside. Cycling through the vineyards of Burgundy was a dream come true for a wine lover like me. The region's picturesque landscapes, adorned with rows of grapevines, provided the perfect backdrop for a leisurely ride. I couldn't resist stopping at some vineyards along the way, tasting exquisite wines and learning about the winemaking process from passionate locals.

My bike tour then took me to the breathtaking Swiss Alps, where the challenge of climbing steep mountain passes was rewarded with awe-inspiring views. The serenity and grandeur of the Alps left me speechless, and I found solace in the solitude of the mountains. The crisp mountain air filled my lungs as I rode through quaint Swiss villages, where locals greeted me with warm smiles and hearty meals.

Crossing into Italy, I couldn't resist a detour to explore the romantic city of Florence. Leaving my bike behind for a while, I wandered through the city's narrow streets, marveling at the masterpieces of art and architecture that surrounded me. Indulging in delicious pizzas and gelatos was a must, and I found myself lingering in outdoor cafés, savoring every bite and embracing the vibrant Italian lifestyle.

After bidding farewell to Florence, I continued my bike tour along the stunning Adriatic coast in Croatia. The crystal-clear turquoise waters and rugged cliffs provided a stunning backdrop for my rides. I explored quaint fishing villages, swam in secluded coves, and indulged in the freshest seafood imaginable. The locals, always welcoming and eager to share their stories, added a beautiful human touch to my experience.

As my bike tour neared its end, I reached the beautiful city of Barcelona in Spain. Cycling through the vibrant streets, I soaked in the rich Catalan culture and admired the stunning architecture of Antoni Gaudí. The lively atmosphere, mouthwatering tapas, and late-night conversations with locals made it the perfect ending to my European bike tour.

Reflecting on my journey, I realized that biking through Europe had not only allowed me to witness the beauty of nature and soak in the history and culture of each place, but it had also given me the opportunity to connect with people from different walks of life. Whether it was a friendly conversation with a local at a café or an impromptu soccer match with children in a small village, these moments made my trip truly unforgettable.

As I packed up my bike to head back home, my heart was filled with a bittersweet mix of gratitude and sadness. Grateful for the incredible experiences and memories I had made, but sad to leave behind the vibrant and diverse continent that had captured my heart. The bike tour through Europe had not only fulfilled my wanderlust but had also shaped me as a person, leaving me with a deeper appreciation for the world and the people who inhabit it.",1,
"The 222nd Infantry Regiment was an infantry regiment of the United States Army, AUS. It served in the 42nd Infantry Division for the duration of the Second World War, and was then deactivated. The regiment distinguished itself in battle against the Wehrmacht and earned the Presidential Unit Citation for courageous action. When the 42nd Infantry Division was activated on 14 July 1943, three new infantry regiments were created to fill the division up because all of the regiments that had formed the division during World War I were serving elsewhere. The 222nd Infantry Regiment, 232nd Infantry Regiment, and the 242nd Infantry Regiment were activated and included recruits from all 48 states. The 222nd Infantry Regiment underwent intense combat training at Camp Gruber, Oklahoma and arrived in Marseille, France, in November 1944. After a brief period of training and reconsolidation, the regiment was attached to ""Task Force Linden"" under the command of General Henning Linden in early December to prepare for combat. On 24 December 1944, the Task Force (TF) entered combat in the vicinity of Strasbourg, relieving the 36th Infantry Division of the Texas Army National Guard and became engaged in minor skirmishing with the Germans until the advent of major battle.[citation needed] On 31 December, the Germans launched a major offensive in north-eastern France, called Operation Nordwind, and managed to gain ground against the Seventh United States Army, and the First French Army. In order to cut off the American held town of Haguenau, the Wehrmacht needed to encircle the position in a pincer move. However, their offensive would grind to a halt once they reached the positions of the 42nd Infantry Division.[1] On the night of 24 January 1945, the second to last day of the German counterattack, the 222nd Infantry Regiment would see its first major combat in the face of a determined and experienced enemy. The G.I.'s were dug in in fighting positions in the Ohlugen Forest looking towards the Forest of Haguenau, where thick foliage and a dense low-lying fog both concealed their positions and obscured the Germans' movements. Facing the green Americans of the 222nd Infantry were elements of the 25th Panzergrenadier Division, the 47th Volksgrenadier Division, and the 7th Fallschirmjäger Division.[1] Colonel Luongo, the commander of the 222nd, spread out his soldiers across five major defensive positions from west to east; a series of hills to the west, in Neubourg, Mill d'Uhrbruck, the Ohlungen Forest, and the town of Schweighausen to the east. The arrival of the Germans was heralded by loud taunts and oaths sent across the line to intimidate the waiting Americans, and the assault began at 1800 with an artillery barrage first on Schweighausen, then eventually the whole regimental line. The barrage included artillery guns and Nebelwerfer rockets, and was very effective despite the darkness of the night.[1] During the first hour of the barrage, nearly all the 222nd's phone lines were knocked out and their radios proved to be ineffective in the woodland. Supporting American artillery was ineffective, and the Battalion HQ for the 1st (1-222) and 2nd (2-222) Battalions had to be moved after receiving accurate fire. E Company 2-222, made first contact with enemy ground troops at 2015, when the Germans charged across the firebreak that separated their two positions. Heavy machine-gun and mortar fire from the US positions halted the attackers, and the commanding officer of E Company (Lieutenant George Carroll) counterattacked and drove the Germans back.[1] This reprieve was short-lived and the Panzergrenadiers attacked the E Company positions once again near the Mill d'Uhrbruck, and overwhelmed the defenders. First Lieutenant Richard Break gathered the remnants of E Company and attempted three counterattacks to regain the position, but these were repulsed. K Company of 3rd Battalion (3-222) was hit with artillery on its right flank and its 2nd Platoon was left with only 22 men under the command of Sergeant Chambers. Their Platoon leader was missing, and was cut off from reinforcement.[1] The position was attacked by a company of Germans and was overrun, and the surviving G.I.'s were forced to make a painfully slow retreat by crawling through a ditch. Only 11 men escaped to the K Company command post at Neubourg. The regiment was heavily engaged all across its line, and during the fighting, First Lieutenant Carlyle Woelfer, the commanding officer of K Company, managed to capture a German officer with valuable maps detailing their offensive plan. The officer and another prisoner were put on an M8 Greyhound of the 813th Tank Destroyer Battalion for transport, but soon began signalling for other German soldiers to come to their rescue. Three Germans popped out and killed PFC Edmund Sheppard, but were in turn killed by Woelfer.[1] At this point in the battle, E Company was weakened and their right flank was exposed due a shifting of troops to protect the left, so the Germans took advantage of this development and attacked through the woods. E Company men were forced to retreat back to Schweighausen, after Germans swarmed their dugouts from multiple directions.[1] First Lieutenant Merrill, leader of the 2nd Platoon, F Company, withdrew the soldiers he could to the outskirts of Schweighausen to regroup for a counterattack on the Ohlungen Forest, which was now occupied by the Germans. The six men guarding Merrill's left flank were overrun and never seen again. The center of the 222nd Infantry's line had been shattered; E Company was cut off, and K and F Companies were mauled. First Lieutenant Carroll, commanding officer of E Company, decided his position was indefensible, and he led his men back to their original positions during a brief lull in the battle around 0230, fighting off groups of enemy along the way. For the rest of the night, the 222nd fought to contain the breakthrough. The right of the line, at Schweighausen, continued to hold. The strongest attack on the town came from the west, when Fallschirmjägers moved up through the Haguenau Forest and came down through the wedge that had been driven between",0,
"L found a condo that she wants to buy. She put $2k down on Friday, and then told me that she'll need another $19k in two weeks. I told her that since we're re-financing the heloc, there's no way I can guarantee we'll have the checks available to write to get that money for her. I also told her they probably want a bank check, and depositing funds from the heloc will take 3 days to clear. So then she responded that I'll need to sell my stocks so she can get the money. To which I responded, no way. I told her to email the mediator about her plans, but she neglected to mention the $19k. So I replied all and mentioned it for her. I also offered the alternative funding from her parents (temporary loan). She was livid that I even mentioned that. She said that there was no way she was going to ask her parents to help her. To which I responded that there was no way I was going to sell my stocks. She said half that money is hers. And I said, half of it is hers once the divorce is final. Then she said that I was trying to screw her over regarding the condo. Like now it's my fault that we don't have the money for her to move out. I had no idea that she was going to need so much of the down payment so soon. How would I know that? Isn't that money supposed to come at the closing? Maybe not. Regardless, she didn't get these details (or at least communicate them to me) when she made the initial offer on the condo. That's not my fault. My parents tell me don't do her any favors -- don't loan her money out of the heloc. Dean thinks I should get her out of the house as soon as possible. Since I want to work things out amicably, I tend to agree with Dean. I just have to make sure that everything is documented that she's taking money out of our accounts in order to buy a new place. She also had the nerve to say to me that several weeks ago she talked to me about alimony, and said that she would drop the alimony if I helped her find a condo. We never had that conversation! This was the first I heard it. Frankly, I'm all for helping her find a condo. And of course, I'm all for not paying alimony. Nonetheless, I told her that if she sought alimony, I would hire a lawyer and go to court. i.e. things would get messy. She seems to be afraid of messy for some reason. She wants to be buddies with me. Fuck that. Once this is over, she will be nothing to me. This morning she also started to suggest that we solidify our visitation agreement. So that she has a more concrete schedule. On her days, she'll get the kids up and take care of everything, and on my days, I'll take care of everything. That's easy for her to say - she lives in the basement, and the kids are right near me. Like I'd ever get to sleep in! Then she also mentioned that this guy that she's seeing, Ozzie, has a visitation agreement where he sees his son on Wednesday and Thurday and every other weekend. She said she wanted her visitation to be in line with his! I stood my ground wiht Tuesday and Thursday. I've already modified my life to meet that schedule. Why should I change my schedule so that she can be on the same schedule as the guy of the moment? Plus, not seeing the kids Wednesday through Sunday would be harder, I think. Then I also brought up how when she has the kids, they should sleep over at her place, so that I have some free time. In general, she was in agreement with that, but she had concerns about getting the kids to school on days when she was working. She offered that maybe she'd have the kids more during the times that she had off. It's funny how much we're talking and discussing these important matters. I think she was livid with me about the financing because I was taking a stand and she wasn't used to that. She's not used to me taking a stand and staying my ground. She also started to talk about how she wasn't sure how she'd come up with the child support payment, after her mortgage, taxes, common fees. I just did a quick calculation on etrade.com, where her mortgage would be $930, common charges she said were $170, and taxes $3000/year = $250/month. That's about $1350/month! Ye gads. Regardless of that cost, she needs to pay for half of child care, which is about $750/month. ($175/week/kid x 2 kids x 4.3 weeks/month) = $1505/month / 2 people = $752/person. And that's just day care! But if she's taking the kids overnight, then it seems fair. Because she will also need to clothe, feed, and house them. Her finances will definitely be tight, though. You know what she needs? A man with a second a income ... wait a second! So interest rates are coming down. That's a good thing for everyone. I suppose I need to re-finance my mortgage, and get her name off of it. I probably ought to talk to mortgage lawyer to see how it's done. I think I need to find the original mortgage documentation to get L off the loan, and then I'll need to re-finance. I'm not sure how that will work, exactly. One step at a time, I guess. L just called saying that her realtor said not to worry about the deposit -- that it can wait until after we re-fi the heloc. ----------------- I just ran some numbers in a loan calculator, and might suggest to L that she",0,
"In the early morning light, the village of Viger awakened with a sense of both anticipation and apprehension. The air was crisp and cool, carrying with it the scent of pine and the distant hum of machinery. For generations, Viger had been a small, close-knit community, nestled in the rolling hills of the countryside. But now, change was on the horizon.

The once quiet village had caught the attention of the expanding city nearby. With its picturesque charm and proximity to urban amenities, Viger had become the perfect candidate for growth and development. The villagers watched as construction crews arrived, marking the start of a transformation that would reshape their lives forever.

Among the villagers was Mademoiselle Viau, a milliner by trade, who had recently moved from the bustling city to escape its hectic pace. She had heard rumors of Viger's impending growth and saw an opportunity to establish herself in a more serene environment. With her keen eye for fashion and her skillful hands, Mademoiselle Viau hoped to bring a touch of elegance to the village.

Mademoiselle Viau settled into a small house on the edge of Viger, her hats and trims gracing the windowsill as she worked diligently to create her masterpieces. As word spread of her arrival, a sense of curiosity and excitement tingled through the village. The women, especially, wondered what new styles and trends she would introduce.

However, not everyone welcomed Mademoiselle Viau with open arms. Widow Laroque, the local dressmaker and hat-trimmer, sensed a potential threat to her business. The widow had long been a fixture in the village, known for her meticulous craftsmanship and attention to detail. She had grown comfortable in her position, catering to the needs of the villagers.

When Widow Laroque caught wind of Mademoiselle Viau's arrival, a wave of unease washed over her. She feared the competition and the potential loss of her loyal clientele. The widow's customers, unsure of what to expect, began to split their loyalties between the two women – some curious about the new fashions Mademoiselle Viau would bring, while others remained faithful to the widow, believing in her years of experience.

As the weeks turned into months, the village began to witness the effects of its newfound connection to the growing city. The once-empty streets now bustled with activity as new shops and cafes sprouted up. The sounds of cars and honking horns replaced the peaceful silence that had once enveloped Viger. Old houses were torn down to make way for modern apartments, and fields turned into shopping complexes.

But amidst this whirlwind of change, something unexpected happened. Mademoiselle Viau and Widow Laroque found themselves drawn together, not by rivalry, but by necessity. The two women, both artists in their own right, realized that their unique skills could complement one another. Mademoiselle Viau, with her fresh ideas and contemporary designs, began collaborating with Widow Laroque, who brought her years of experience and attention to detail to the table.

Their joint efforts resulted in an explosion of creativity and innovation. Together, they created a unique blend of traditional craftsmanship and modern fashion that captivated both the villagers and those from the city who flocked to Viger. What had once been a source of tension and concern for the widow became an opportunity for growth and collaboration.

As the years passed, Viger continued to transform, but with a newfound harmony between the old and the new. The village, once on the outskirts of the city, had seamlessly integrated into its urban sprawl. The small houses that had once stood alone now formed part of a vibrant community, where people from all walks of life came together.

Through their persistence and shared vision, Mademoiselle Viau and Widow Laroque had not only weathered the storm of change but had also left an indelible mark on the village's identity. Their story, a testament to the power of collaboration and innovation, became a source of inspiration for the villagers and a reminder that progress need not come at the expense of tradition.

And so, as the sun began to set over the transformed landscape of Viger, the villagers reflected on the journey they had embarked upon. They marveled at how a once quiet and serene village had become a bustling center of creativity and commerce. And as they looked ahead, uncertainty gave way to hope, for they knew that with each passing day, Viger would continue to evolve, leaving behind a legacy that celebrated both its past and its future.",1,
"Title: Standing by Her Side: Supporting My Friend through Breast Cancer

Introduction:
Hey there, friend! I want to share with you my experience of supporting my friend through her breast cancer journey. It has been a rollercoaster ride of emotions, but in the midst of the fear and uncertainty, our friendship has grown stronger than ever. I hope that my story will inspire and encourage you to be there for your loved ones facing similar battles.

Chapter 1: The Shock of Diagnosis
It all started one sunny afternoon when my friend, Sarah, called me, her voice trembling. She told me the news no one ever wants to hear: she had been diagnosed with breast cancer. It felt like a punch to the gut, and I struggled to find words of comfort. But I knew I had to be strong for her, so I put on a brave face and assured her that we would get through this together.

Chapter 2: Doctor Appointments and Treatment Plans
The next few weeks were filled with doctor appointments and treatment plans. I accompanied Sarah to every appointment, holding her hand as we listened to the doctors explain the various treatments and potential side effects. It was overwhelming, but having someone by her side made it a little easier for Sarah to navigate through the medical jargon and make informed decisions about her treatment.

Chapter 3: Family Dynamics and Support
Dealing with cancer not only affects the patient but also their families. Sarah's family was understandably distraught, and emotions were running high. It was essential for me to be a calm presence during family discussions and to provide a listening ear. I learned that sometimes all we need is to vent and have someone validate our feelings.

Chapter 4: Laughter and Lightness
In the midst of all the tears and anxiety, we found moments of laughter and lightness. We reminisced about our silly adventures and shared jokes, knowing that a good laugh could momentarily chase away the darkness. These moments of levity were precious and reminded us that even in the toughest times, there is still joy to be found.

Chapter 5: The Power of Friendship
Throughout this journey, one thing became crystal clear: the power of friendship is immeasurable. I made a promise to Sarah that I would be there for her every step of the way, and I meant it with all my heart. From accompanying her to chemotherapy sessions to sitting by her side during recovery, I wanted her to feel my unwavering support and love.

Chapter 6: The Importance of Hope
One thing that has sustained us throughout this journey is hope. We cling to the belief that Sarah will beat this disease, and we envision a future where she is free of cancer. We fill our conversations with positive affirmations and remind each other that hope is a powerful force that can fuel our spirits even on the darkest days.

Chapter 7: The Strength of Prayer
Prayer has also played a significant role in our journey. We have found solace in praying together, pouring our fears and anxieties into the hands of a higher power. We believe that prayer not only gives us strength but also connects us to a community of people who are rooting for Sarah's recovery.

Chapter 8: Celebrating Victories, Big and Small
In the midst of the challenges, we celebrate every victory, no matter how small. We cheer when Sarah finishes a round of chemotherapy, throw a party when she reaches a milestone in her treatment plan, and rally around her during every positive update from the doctors. These celebrations remind us of the progress being made and give us the courage to keep pushing forward.

Conclusion:
Supporting a friend through breast cancer is not an easy task, but it is one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. We have cried together, laughed together, and prayed together, and in doing so, we have grown closer than ever before. Cancer may have invaded our lives, but it can never break the bond of friendship that holds us together. If you find yourself in a similar situation, remember that your love and support can make a world of difference. Stand by your friend, be their rock, and let your friendship be the light that guides them through the darkness.",1,
"and the British representative stated that he was satisfied and the past should be forgotten. This greatly relieved the King of Siam, and partly as a token of gratitude, but partly also, perhaps, to wipe out any little remaining vestige of unpleasantness which England might feel toward him, he wished to send the Queen a present--the sole sure way of propitiating an enemy, according to Oriental ideas. This present ought not only to be a royal one, but transcendently royal. Wherefore, what offering could be so meet as that of a white elephant? My position in the Indian civil service was such that I was deemed peculiarly worthy of the honor of conveying the present to her Majesty. A ship was fitted out for me and my servants and the officers and attendants of the elephant, and in due time I arrived in New York harbor and placed my royal charge in admirable quarters in Jersey City. It was necessary to remain awhile in order to recruit the animal's health before resuming the voyage. All went well during a fortnight--then my calamities began. The white elephant was stolen! I was called up at dead of night and informed of this fearful misfortune. For some moments I was beside myself with terror and anxiety; I was helpless. Then I grew calmer and collected my faculties. I soon saw my course--for, indeed, there was but the one course for an intelligent man to pursue. Late as it was, I flew to New York and got a policeman to conduct me to the headquarters of the detective force. Fortunately I arrived in time, though the chief of the force, the celebrated Inspector Blunt was just on the point of leaving for his home. He was a man of middle size and compact frame, and when he was thinking deeply he had a way of kniting his brows and tapping his forehead reflectively with his finger, which impressed you at once with the conviction that you stood in the presence of a person of no common order. The very sight of him gave me confidence and made me hopeful. I stated my errand. It did not flurry him in the least; it had no more visible effect upon his iron self-possession than if I had told him somebody had stolen my dog. He motioned me to a seat, and said, calmly: “Allow me to think a moment, please.” So saying, he sat down at his office table and leaned his head upon his hand. Several clerks were at work at the other end of the room; the scratching of their pens was all the sound I heard during the next six or seven minutes. Meantime the inspector sat there, buried in thought. Finally he raised his head, and there was that in the firm lines of his face which showed me that his brain had done its work and his plan was made. Said he--and his voice was low and impressive: “This is no ordinary case. Every step must be warily taken; each step must be made sure before the next is ventured. And secrecy must be observed--secrecy profound and absolute. Speak to no one about the matter, not even the reporters. I will take care of them; I will see that they get only what it may suit my ends to let them know.” He touched a bell; a youth appeared. “Alaric, tell the reporters to remain for the present.” The boy retired. “Now let us proceed to business--and systematically. Nothing can be accomplished in this trade of mine without strict and minute method.” He took a pen and some paper. “Now--name of the elephant?” “Hassan Ben Ali Ben Selim Abdallah Mohammed Moisé Alhammal Jamsetjejeebhoy Dhuleep Sultan Ebu Bhudpoor.” “Very well. Given name?” “Jumbo.” “Very well. Place of birth?” “The capital city of Siam.” “Parents living?” “No--dead.” “Had they any other issue besides this one?” “None. He was an only child.” “Very well. These matters are sufficient under that head. Now please describe the elephant, and leave out no particular, however insignificant--that is, insignificant from your point of view. To men in my profession there are no insignificant particulars; they do not exist.” I described, he wrote. When I was done, he said: “Now listen. If I have made any mistakes, correct me.” He read as follows: “Height, 19 feet; length from apex of forehead to insertion of tail, 26 feet; length of trunk, 16 feet; length of tail, 6 feet; total length, including trunk, and tail, 48 feet; length of tusks, 9 1/2 feet; ears keeping with these dimensions; footprint resembles the mark left when one up-ends a barrel in the snow; color of the elephant, a dull white; has a hole the size of a plate in each ear for the insertion of jewelry and possesses the habit in a remarkable degree of squirting water upon spectators and of maltreating with his trunk not only such persons as he is acquainted with, but even entire strangers; limps slightly with his right hind leg, and has a small scar in his left armpit caused by a former boil; had on, when stolen, a castle containing seats for fifteen persons, and a gold-cloth saddle-blanket the size of an ordinary carpet.” There were no mistakes. The inspector touched the bell, handed the description to Alaric, and said: “Have fifty thousand copies of this printed at once and mailed to every detective office and pawnbroker's shop on the continent.” Alaric retired. “There--so far, so good. Next, I must have a photograph of the property.” I gave him one. He examined it critically, and said: “It must do, since we can do no better; but he has his trunk curled up and tucked into his mouth. That is unfortunate, and is calculated to mislead, for of course he does not usually have it in that position.” He touched his bell. “Alaric, have fifty thousand copies of this photograph made the first thing in the morning, and",0,
"Anti-German (German: Antideutsch) is the generic name applied to a variety of theoretical and political tendencies within the left mainly in Germany and Austria. The Anti-Germans form one of the main camps within the broader Antifa movement, alongside the Anti-Zionist anti-imperialists, after the two currents split between the 1990s and the early 2000s as a result of their diverging views on Israel.[2] The anti-Germans are a fringe movement within the German left: In 2006 Deutsche Welle estimated the number of anti-Germans to be between 500 and 3,000.[3] The basic standpoint of the anti-Germans includes opposition to German nationalism, a critique of mainstream left anti-capitalist views, which are thought to be simplistic and structurally antisemitic,[4] and a critique of antisemitism, which is considered to be deeply rooted in German cultural history. As a result of this analysis of antisemitism, support for Israel and opposition to Anti-Zionism is a primary unifying factor of the anti-German movement.[5] The critical theory of Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer is often cited by anti-German theorists.[4]: 2 The term does not generally refer to any one specific radical left tendency, but rather a wide variety of distinct currents, ranging from the so-called ""hardcore"" anti-Germans such as the quarterly journal Bahamas to ""softcore"" anti-Germans such as the radical left journal Phase 2. Some anti-German ideas have also exerted an influence on the broader radical leftist milieu, such as the monthly magazine konkret and the weekly newspaper Jungle World. The rapid collapse of the German Democratic Republic and the looming reunification of Germany triggered a major crisis within the German Left. The Anti-German tendency first developed in a discussion group known as the Radical Left, which consisted of elements of the German Green Party, Trotskyists, members of the Communist League (Kommunistischer Bund), the journal konkret, and members of Autonome, Libertarian and Anarchist groups, who rejected plans by other segments of Leftist political organisations to join a governing coalition.[6] This circle adopted a position developed by the Kommunistischer Bund, a decidedly pessimistic analysis with regard to the potential for revolutionary change in Germany. Known as the ""Fascisation"" analysis, this theory held that due to the particularity of German history and development, the endemic crisis of capitalism would lead to a move towards the far right and to a new Fascism.[7]: 11 During an internal debate, representatives of the majority tendency said that the minority current, due to its bleak analysis and unwavering pessimism, might as well just emigrate to the Bahamas.[8] The minority tendency, in an ironic gesture, thus named their discussion organ Bahamas.[8] In 2007 Haaretz described Bahamas as ""the leading publication of the hardcore pro-Israel, anti-German communist movement.""[8] The phrase Nie wieder Deutschland (""Germany, Never Again""), which became a central anti-German slogan, originated in demonstrations against reunification,[3][8][9][10] the largest of which attracted a crowd of approximately 10,000 people.[7] This early alliance dissipated shortly after the process of reunification was complete.[6] The notion of a revival of German nationalism and racism as a result of the reunification seemed to confirm itself over the course of the 1990s, as shown by such events as the Rostock-Lichtenhagen riots and a murderous attack on a Turkish family in the West German town of Solingen.[11] This wave of anti-immigrant violence led to tightening of Germany's hitherto liberal asylum laws.[citation needed] As a result of these conflicts, through the 1990s, small groups and circles associated with Anti-German ideas began to emerge throughout Germany, refining their ideological positions by dissenting from prevailing opinions within the German Left. These positions became particularly prominent within ""Anti-fascist"" groups.[citation needed] The Gulf War in 1990 consolidated the Anti-German position around a new issue, specifically criticism of the broader Left's failure to side with Israel against rocket attacks launched into civilian areas by the regime of Saddam Hussein.[6] Leading left-wing writers such as Eike Geisel and Wolfgang Pohrt [de] criticised the German peace movement for failing to appreciate the threat posed by Ba'athism to left-wing movements through the Middle East, in particular around the Iraqi regime's use of poison gas.[6] The outbreak of the Second Intifada provided another focal point for the emerging Anti-German movement. While other left-wing analysis identified Israel as an aggressor to the point they were perceived by the Anti-German movement as supporting Islamist groups such as Hamas, the Anti-German camp called for unconditional solidarity with Israel, explicitly Jews and other non-Arab groups native to the region against pan-Arabist ideology. This resulted in leading Anti-German publications including Konkret and Bahamas to draw links between the antisemitism of Islamist groups and the antisemitism of the Nazis, as both groups upheld the extermination of the Jews as central to their politics. This break with other left-wing positions was further intensified by the September 11 attacks on America, with Anti-Germans strongly criticising other leftist positions that claimed that Al-Qaeda's assault on the United States was motivated by anti-imperialist or anti-capitalist resistance against American hegemony,[6] instead claiming that Al-Qaeda and their attacks represented a modern form of fascism that needed to be stringently opposed.[7] In 1995, the fiftieth anniversary of the bombing of Dresden, anti-Germans praised the bombing on the grounds that so many of the city's civilians had supported Nazism.[3] Kyle James points to this as an example of a shift towards support for the United States that became more pronounced after 9/11.[3] Similar demonstrations are annually held, the slogans ""Bomber Harris, do it again!"" and ""Deutsche Täter sind keine Opfer!"" (""German perpetrators are no victims!"") have become common.[4] The 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia was also a focus of opposition for the anti-Germans, as for most of the radical left. Many anti-Germans condemned the war as a repetition of the political constellation of forces during the Second World War, with the Serbs in the role of victim of German imperialism. Some anti-Germans thus issued a call for ""unconditional"" support for the regime of Slobodan Milošević.[citation needed] The reasons the German government gave to legitimize the war – from an anti-German perspective – marked a turning point in the discourse",0,
"Photozincography, a photographic process developed by Sir Henry James in the mid-nineteenth century, revolutionized the field of printing and played a significant role in the Ordnance Survey. This informative account provides a historical overview of the process, highlights its advantages over lithography, delves into its application in the Ordnance Survey, and explores the reasons for its decline in popularity.

Photozincography emerged as a groundbreaking method of reproducing images and text using photography and zinc plates. Developed by Henry James, an English soldier and cartographer, the process gained recognition in the 1850s. Before photozincography, lithography was the dominant technique for producing maps, illustrations, and other printed materials. However, the new process introduced by James offered several advantages over lithography.

The photozincographic process involved several steps. First, a photographic negative of the desired image was made on a glass plate coated with a light-sensitive material. This negative was then transferred onto a zinc plate coated with a layer of albumen, a substance derived from egg whites that provided a receptive surface for the subsequent chemical processes. The plate was exposed to light, causing the albumen to harden. After exposure, the plate was treated with an acid solution, which etched the image onto the zinc. The areas exposed to light hardened and resisted the acid, while the unexposed parts were dissolved away. This etched plate, known as a ""zincograph,"" was then ready for printing.

Photozincography offered several advantages over lithography. Firstly, it allowed for the reproduction of intricate details with great accuracy, as the process relied on photography to capture the image. This precision was particularly beneficial in the field of cartography, allowing for the creation of highly detailed and accurate maps. Secondly, the photozincographic process was more cost-effective than lithography, as it eliminated the need for skilled artists to create and redraw illustrations. The use of photography reduced the labor-intensive nature of the process and minimized the chances of errors or inconsistencies in the final product.

The Ordnance Survey, responsible for mapping Great Britain, recognized the potential of photozincography and adopted it for their operations. The accurate reproduction of maps was pivotal for military and civilian purposes alike, and the Ordnance Survey aimed to produce high-quality, detailed maps efficiently. Photozincography enabled them to achieve this goal. By utilizing the process, they were able to create accurate maps with intricate details, capturing the landscape and topographical features with precision. This advancement greatly aided military planning and navigation, as well as civil engineering projects such as railway construction and urban planning.

Despite its initial success, photozincography eventually declined in popularity and was superseded by other printing techniques. One of the reasons for its decline was the technological progress in the field of photography itself. Advances in photographic emulsions and the introduction of more efficient printing methods, such as photolithography and photogravure, made photozincography less competitive. These newer methods offered similar benefits in terms of precision and detail reproduction but were more cost-effective and required less time and effort.

Furthermore, the rise of offset printing in the late nineteenth century further diminished the appeal of photozincography. Offset printing utilized a flat plate surface rather than a relief surface like zincography, offering an even higher level of detail reproduction. This modern technique quickly gained popularity due to its speed, cost-efficiency, and ability to reproduce colors accurately.

In conclusion, photozincography, developed by Sir Henry James in the mid-nineteenth century, revolutionized the field of printing and played a significant role in the Ordnance Survey. Its advantages over lithography, such as precision, cost-effectiveness, and the ability to reproduce intricate details, made it an ideal method for mapping and illustration reproduction. However, technological advancements in photography and the emergence of more efficient printing techniques eventually led to its decline in popularity. Nonetheless, the impact of photozincography on the field of printing and its contribution to the Ordnance Survey cannot be overstated, marking it as a significant milestone in the evolution of printing processes.",1,
"Once upon a time, in the vast American wilderness, there lived a brave warrior named Sleeping Wolf. He was a member of the Ojibwa tribe, a proud and ancient people with a deep connection to the land. The Ojibwa tribe lived a nomadic lifestyle, following the rhythm of the seasons and relying on the bounties of nature for their survival.

Sleeping Wolf was known throughout the tribe for his fearlessness and his unwavering dedication to his people. He had fought in countless battles, defending his tribe against rival tribes and protecting the sacred grounds that were central to their spiritual beliefs. The Ojibwa people lived harmoniously with nature, recognizing the interconnectedness of all living things, and Sleeping Wolf embodied this belief.

But Sleeping Wolf had another love in his life - his wife, White Lily. Their love was a testament to the strength and depth of human connection, and they were inseparable from the moment they met. White Lily was a beautiful woman, known for her wisdom and compassion. She stood by Sleeping Wolf’s side, offering him support and love in every battle he fought.

As the seasons changed, so did the battles that Sleeping Wolf faced. The Ojibwa tribe had always been known for their fierce warriors, but they also believed in finding peaceful resolutions whenever possible. Sleeping Wolf embodied this balance, always striving to protect his people without unnecessary bloodshed.

One fateful day, another tribe invaded the Ojibwa's territory. The enemy tribe sought to claim the fertile hunting grounds and sacred lands that had been cherished by the Ojibwa for generations. Sleeping Wolf knew he had to act swiftly to defend his tribe’s way of life and protect the land that held immeasurable value.

He rallied his fellow warriors and led them into battle. His courage and skill on the battlefield were unparalleled, and his presence inspired his comrades to fight with unwavering determination. The Ojibwa warriors fought fiercely, their war cries echoing through the forest as they defended their homeland.

Sleeping Wolf’s love for his people burned like a fire within him, but his heart always longed for the safety of his beloved White Lily. During the battles, his thoughts would often drift to her, his mind filled with the image of her gentle smile and her unwavering support.

As the battle raged on, Sleeping Wolf’s leadership and prowess became legendary among both friend and foe. The enemy tribe realized they were facing a formidable opponent, and their efforts to conquer the Ojibwa tribe were met with fierce resistance.

Sleeping Wolf led his warriors in a final, decisive battle. The clash of weapons filled the air as the two tribes fought for dominance. The battle was bloody and brutal, but Sleeping Wolf and his warriors fought with honor and the belief that they were protecting their way of life.

In the midst of the chaos, tragedy struck. A stray arrow found its mark, piercing the heart of Sleeping Wolf. As he felt his life-force fading, his thoughts turned to White Lily, his beloved wife. With his last breath, he whispered a prayer for her safety and happiness, unable to bear the thought of leaving her alone.

White Lily, hearing of her husband's demise, was overcome with grief. She mourned his loss, her heart heavy with sorrow. But she also knew that Sleeping Wolf would want her to carry on and live a happy life. In his memory, she dedicated herself to preserving the traditions and values of the Ojibwa tribe, becoming a wise and respected leader.

The legend of Sleeping Wolf and his undying love for White Lily lives on in the hearts of the Ojibwa people. As the seasons change, they remember the brave warrior who fought for his people and the love that fueled his spirit. The tragic fate of Sleeping Wolf and his wife serves as a reminder of the sacrifices made in the name of love and the enduring legacy of those who are willing to fight for what they hold dear.",1,
"urlLink urlLink Appreciation The Healing Heart of Annalena Tonelli Humanitarian Gave Her Life to Helping Others By David Brown Washington Post Staff Writer Wednesday, October 8, 2003; Page C01 We live in an age of the hidden motive. Every action has a shadow life where its real truth lies, and we're told the wise person would best be on the lookout for it from the start. In many ways we're especially suspicious of selfless deeds. Even when goodness doesn't bring money, status and power, doesn't it pay off richly in some other egotistical currency? Perhaps this is true, although it seems as naive a view as the one it purports to overthrow. But even if it is, there are people who are in some essential way exceptions to this weeding of human agency. Annalena Tonelli was one of them. Tonelli spent her adult life rescuing, treating and curing people with tuberculosis and other diseases in Somalia and Kenya. She was a fearless and tireless person who also seemed incapable of discouragement. She was unsentimental and calculating when necessary. She eschewed organizations except for ones she created and could move -- or abandon -- at will, like the collection of desert people she so loved and admired. In her life -- 60 years, more than half of it spent in East Africa -- she saved thousands of lives. Three days ago, she lost hers. According to wire service reports, Tonelli was shot twice in the head Sunday night when leaving a hospital for tuberculosis patients in Boorama, a city in northern Somalia. It is hard to imagine what the reason for this crime might be. I met Tonelli 10 years ago when I went to Somalia to report on the late stage of the disastrous famine accompanying civil war in that country. I spent three days at an institution she established in Merca, a city on the Indian Ocean south of Mogadishu. She called it Koch Hospital -- a reference to Robert Koch, a German bacteriologist and early tuberculosis researcher -- rather than a more obvious name that would draw attention to the wasting and stigmatizing disease of its occupants. At the time, it was the only place in Somalia treating tuberculosis patients correctly and adequately. She had 700 under her care, and 1,500 diagnosed and awaiting treatment, when I was there. The most ill, including about 100 children, stayed in three adjoining houses with courtyards she had refitted as open wards. Around town she and her assistant had rented more than 100 houses where patients, and often whole families, stayed while taking six months of antituberculosis drug therapy -- the essential, indivisible requirement for cure, and one especially difficult to apply in a country of nomads and people displaced by civil war. Tonelli fed them and treated them entirely for free. Patients came from the entire southern half of Somalia, most arriving emaciated and near death. ""If they die they die in the first or second day,"" she told me as we walked through one of the courtyards one morning. Under awnings skeleton men lay, or, if they were strong enough, sat on woven mats. At their heads were their few possessions: shoulder bags, hollowed gourdlike satchels, tea kettles. Each had a small earthenware spittoon that was given a layer of fresh sand each day at dawn. ""If they take drugs for two weeks, it is done. Almost nobody dies then."" Done, but of course not over. Curing TB takes time and patience, and Tonelli had both in portions hard for an American to comprehend. She grew up near Bologna. Her father was an economist and authority on cooperatives, her mother a homemaker. She was the second oldest of five children. A brother, Bruno, now a physician, still lives in their home town of Forli. It is the hub of several networks that raise money for his sister's work. Tonelli was a bit of a child prodigy. She trained as a lawyer but most of all wanted to go into the developing world. ""My family did not want it. So I took the first chance."" She arrived in East Africa in January 1969 and has worked there on and off ever since. For many years she treated TB patients in northern Kenya. Most were ethnic Somalis, dry-land herdsmen. The patients would not stay in hospitals, and their families would not wait for them. Tonelli didn't try to change their ways. She built open-air treatment centers called manyattas, where people could stay for the half-year course of treatment. When it was time for a person to leave, she put the word out and the patient's family would magically appear in a week or so and pick him up. She performed this work largely out of public view until 1985. That was when the Kenyan army was sent in to kill members of a local tribe with links to Somali guerrillas in Ethiopia. Hundreds of people were massacred and the wounded left to die. ""She took her Toyota, painted a red cross on it and went out into the desert with water,"" said Barbara Lefkow, 76, of Chevy Chase. At the time, Lefkow was the wife of an American diplomat in Nairobi and was also a physical therapist who worked on and off with Tonelli. ""She and a few of her assistants picked up the survivors and brought them back to the rehab center. She saved some of them, and she made a list of the dead and gave it to me to smuggle out."" Tonelli's action and the publicity surrounding it led the Kenyan government to expel her. She returned to Italy, received training in Liverpool on treating tropical disease and eventually returned to Somalia to take up the work again. The logistical difficulty of that work is hard to imagine. In Merca she supervised the purchase of fresh food for hundreds of people each day. She had a large local payroll to administer. And the key to curing TB is",0,
"Bacterial wilt of turfgrass is a destructive disease caused by the pathogenic bacterium Xanthomonas campestris pv. graminis. This disease poses a significant threat to the turfgrass industry, as it can lead to severe economic losses and aesthetic damage to lawns, golf courses, and sports fields. Understanding the biology and management of this disease is crucial for turfgrass managers and researchers, as they strive to develop effective control strategies.

Symptoms of bacterial wilt of turfgrass include yellowing and wilting of the leaves, which progress into brown to black lesions on the affected blades. As the disease advances, these lesions coalesce, resulting in extensive turfgrass decline and death. The bacterium primarily infects the vascular system of the host plant, blocking the flow of water and nutrients, leading to the characteristic wilt symptoms.

Xanthomonas campestris pv. graminis can be transmitted through various means, including contaminated equipment, infected grass clippings, and irrigation water. It can also be spread by wind, rain, or insects that feed on infected plants and carry the bacteria to healthy turfgrass. The bacterium can survive for extended periods in the soil, making it challenging to control once established.

Integrated disease management strategies are critical in controlling bacterial wilt of turfgrass. These strategies involve a combination of cultural, chemical, and biological control methods. Cultural practices, such as proper irrigation and fertilization, regular mowing, and removal of infected grass clippings, can help reduce the disease's spread. Additionally, promoting overall turfgrass health through appropriate cultural practices can enhance the grass's natural defense mechanisms against the pathogen.

Chemical control options are limited for bacterial wilt, as no chemical compounds provide complete eradication of the pathogen. However, copper-based fungicides and antibiotics have been shown to provide some level of control when used preventively or in the early stages of infection. These chemicals work by suppressing the bacterial population and minimizing disease progression.

Biological control is an emerging field of research for managing bacterial wilt of turfgrass. Scientists are investigating the use of beneficial microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi, to suppress the growth and spread of Xanthomonas campestris pv. graminis. These biocontrol agents can competitively exclude the pathogen, produce antimicrobial compounds, or induce systemic resistance in the host plant. Although promising, the development and implementation of biocontrol strategies for turfgrass diseases are still in the early stages of research.

Another avenue of ongoing research is the development of resistant turfgrass cultivars. Breeding programs aim to identify and select grass varieties that possess natural resistance or tolerance to bacterial wilt. Through traditional breeding techniques or genetic engineering, scientists seek to introduce disease-resistant genes into commercially important turfgrass species. This approach offers long-term solutions to the disease problem by reducing the reliance on chemical treatments and enhancing the overall sustainability of turfgrass management.

In conclusion, bacterial wilt of turfgrass caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. graminis is a significant disease that threatens the turfgrass industry. Understanding the disease's symptoms, transmission, and control methods is crucial for effective management. Cultural practices, chemical control, and ongoing research in biological control and resistant cultivar development offer hope for combating this destructive disease. Continued research and collaboration among turfgrass managers, researchers, and breeders are essential to develop sustainable disease management strategies and minimize the economic and aesthetic impacts of bacterial wilt of turfgrass.",1,
